At first it seemed to have decent graphics and good background music, but playing the hunting game turned out to be super-frustrating. You're given four regions to hunt in but at first only Great Lakes is available, and you must finish each objective to unlock the next game. So the gameplay is very linear. But trying to shoot the animals proved almost impossible. In the very first round, I was told to kill 5 deer in 2 minutes. It took over 30 seconds for the first deer to appear, and man was he running fast. I chose the touch control where it was very difficult to aim, plus unlike any other game I've played, I had to remember to use the L button to shoot! You cannot configure the buttons! I also tried the button control scheme but it was equally frustrating.

Here comes the absolutely worst part: I did manage to shoot down 5 deer and the screen showed so, yet at the end the game said I'd failed! I tried it again and the same: I was sure I'd shot down 5 deer but the game recorded none. This Italian-developed game is absolutely one of the worst games of all time.","Terrible, terrible game!",1355875200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The right mouse button no longer has any resistance, and so any inadvertent touching results in the mouse thinking i pressed the button.  While i can lay my finger on the left mouse button, my other finger must constantly hover just above the right mouse button.  There have been so many inadvertent right clicks because of this, that i finally switched back to my standard microsoft optical mouse, because it was ruining gaming for me.

On top of that, I've experienced what a lot of others have complained about on here, the mouse's optical tracker going haywire.  Generally what happens to me is the mouse won't sense ""down"" anymore, but it sense left, right and up just fine.  I jiggle the mouse around and lift if off the pad a couple of times and it seems to fix itself, but this is unacceptable when you're playing a video game, especially if you're online and others are depending on you.  I've seen reviewers claiming that this is because of dust on the pad, but I don't believe that.  The microsoft mouse i mentioned has no such problems, and it is optical as well.  I even took to regularly using a lint roller on the pad, and that made no difference at all.

Over all, a cool looking mouse, but for all the feature, none of them are worthy of extra stars if the unit does not even function basically as a mouse should.  This thing feels like a rip off to me, and if I wasn't fairly certain I was past the warranty point, I'd contact the company and try to get my money back.  No faith in their own product, and you'd apparently be wise to follow suit.

UPDATE: They wrote me back to say they will honor the warranty IF i produce the original purchase receipt.  Not possible since I bought this on amazon a few months back, used.  I double checked and sure enough, their warranty is non-transferable.  Only the shadiest companies do that to try to curb warranty costs.  2 years is 2 years is 2 years....not supposed to matter who owns the product.",Wears out too quickly and too quirky to be a gaming mouse,1373673600,,{'Color:': ' Matte Black'},

1.0,False,"12 19, 2012",A13O00BU4K4RG2,B0050SYDEQ,Ron B,"Forza Horizon is nothing like Forza 4, it is an arcade game where you drive cars. The Horizon game itself is fun; driving around racing AI drivers, racing challenges and ""street races"" for credits and cars. Even for a novice, you reach the limits of the game quickly. The game map is not very big and becomes repetitive pretty fast. No real tuning of cars. You buy cars in download packs, then you have to ""win"" the cars you bought with game credits. No Free Play like in Forza 4. Multiplayer, well, hard to tell what's going on there. Lag, cheating or both make racing against cars that are flying, traveling underground or moving at warp speed make it virtually unplayable. And then there's people who play just to crash you out of the race.
They just came out with the ""Rally Expansion Pack"". Sounds like fun, but is really boring. You must finish all stages of a particular race in one sitting or you have to go back and start from the beginning. Either do what the Forza Horizon game commands you to do or be sentenced to boring replays. They should call it ""Groundhog Day Forza"".
The Forza Motorsports servers are down for me about 50% of the time or more, which means you can't win points or credits, receive messages or race online.

Upon opening and setting up the new console, I was excited to get the initial set up complete and throw in Titanfall and start playing. My excitement quickly faded when the initial set-up/download took over an hour and a half. After the download for the set-up was finished, I decided to check my internet connection and it was working at a fast speed with no foreseeable problems which drew more questions. I then went to type in the code to download the Titanfall game that was included in my bundle. After close to 3 hours, the download was only at 7% and I became worried. Still not wanting to give up on the Xbox one before I had even played it yet, I decided to throw in a game my wife had gotten and the console made me do an immediate update for her game which only took half an hour. Once the update was completed, it made me download the game to the hard drive which took an hour and a half. After her game finally finished downloading, she played it for about 20 minutes before we headed to bed for the night. Thinking that leaving the console for the next few hours to let Titanfall download seemed like a good idea. When I woke up in the morning and not only had the game not downloaded but the Xbox had turned off right after I went to sleep. When I turned the console on in the morning, the download had stopped and had gone back down to 1%. Just to be clear, I don't have a slow internet connection and the downloads were still taking forever to get anywhere at all. I've always been a fan of Microsoft, but it seems like they're going away from wanting to have user friendly systems and wanting to make a non-user friendly system that's as high tech as they can get it with taking away from user control. This is the worst system I've ever purchased and I will have a full refund by the end of the week. Despite the positive reviews on this page, please read user reviews online and you'll see the massive amount of complaints dealing with incredibly slow download times. A few things to keep in mind before purchasing this console..... the graphics are the exact same as the 360. Also, when a new system comes out for purchase there are several things you expect. You should expect it to be more streamlined and smaller with the new technology that's out there. With the xbox one, you get none of these things. The console itself is big and bulky and the new Kinect is twice as big as the 360 version. If you're seriously considering purchasing the Xbox One and are a fan of Microsoft gaming consoles, please just stick with the Xbox 360 and like I stated before, if you don't believe my review, look on all the Xbox One blogs online and you'll see how much it really is sinking in popularity. Thanks

6 June 2014**** Update. Talked to Microsoft about snail speed download times and I was told that's been happening a lot and they are working on it. Game finally finished downloading after 3 days off and on. Game itself was great with the one exception that it's only for online play. So as it doesn't have an offline campaign mode, when new games come out for the Xbox one and people move on to other games, you'll no longer be able to play this game.

10 June 2014**** Update Three: The Kinect is terrible as well. In addition to the Kinect being terrible, after trying to re-setup the voice recognition to turn the console on, it continues to fail. I also can't turn on the Xbox One via controller or Kinect and the only way I can turn it on is actually walking up to the console and hitting the xbox button on the system itself.

the combat is simplistic and it holds your hand the whole way, in case you've never played a video game before in your life the game pauses itself and indicated when to block, ALWAYS, at first i thought it was tutorial, but no, right up until i stopped playing the game would give me a nice litle indicator screen to block with, if you fail the block however you just get knocked down... thats all... i can't imagine who thought it was a good idea to have the combat on the level of playing with duplo blocks.

Now, on to the review. I'm always loved Maxis games, and own all of the sim city games, going back to the original for Nintendo. I also own the Sims, the Sims II, and enjoyed them quite a bit. So I was really looking forward to this game, and have tracked its progress for nearly two years.
I was excited about the concept, and watching as my genetic children grew to take over the universe...

Sadly, most of what was most exciting about that original concept has been stripped from the game. Now, as other have mentioned, adding more legs doesn't increase speed more than a better +5 foot. Many of the genetic options are self-excluding, because why would you pick an inferior body part even if it looked cool, knowing it would make your creatures ultimately inferior?

I couldn't have been more wrong.

As headsets go, I have worn a LOT of them.  I've owned old-fashioned wired headsets, pre-bluetooth wireless that communicated with a little receiver you clipped to your belt and plugged into your phone, and of course... plenty of bluetooth sets.

Let me start by saying that you do NOT need this headset for a PlayStation3.  In theory, ANY bluetooth headset will work with a PS3.  (Granted some won't because bluetooth is inherently buggy technology.)  Likewise, this headset will work with almost any bluetooth phone.  However, my personal preference is to have separate headsets because I don't like pairing and unpairing all the time.

Having said that, let's talk about this headset.  It is about as basic as basic gets.  If all you need is basic, more power to you, but you'll find similar quality for less money with other sets. Try the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jabra-BT4010/dp/B001F8FH8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jabra BT4010</a>, which as of this writing sells for half the price of the Sony.  Heck, you can even find $10 bluetooth headsets if you really want to go cheap!

Apart from poor value, the Sony set is an awkward fit.  It has only a thin rubber ring around a little plastic ""barrel"" that is supposed to stay fastened in your ear.  Most other sets either have a ""form-fitted"" rubber piece or simply stay out of your ear altogether.  This design gets uncomfortable quickly because A) the part that goes in your ear may not be the right size for your ear and B) the over-the-ear loop is made of cheap plastic as opposed to being rubber or having a rubber coating like many other sets.

The battery life is decent, but nothing to write home about.  And the charging stand? It's cheap, very lightweight plastic that falls over very easily.  If the USB cable is a little bit stiff, the natural tendency for it to curl may very well topple the stand.

As for sound quality... yeah, basic again.  Sure, it works, but once again it is very basic.  I felt like it didn't have a very good range of volume.  Many times I had it cranked to the max and still could barely hear.

Since games are usually $60 and this headset came bundled inside a $60 game, I tried hard to find a reason to keep it, after all wasn't it ""free""?  In the end, I could find no redeeming qualities and returned it rather than allowing it to take up space in a drawer somewhere.

If you'd like some good places to start your search for another headset, here are a few:

Personally, I just can't get over the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jabra-FreeSpeak-BT250V/dp/B00080UHA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jabra FreeSpeak BT250V</a>.  It's so comfortable I don't even notice it's there and it also has a vibrating/call notification feature, which is absolutely great for leaving your phone on the charger and keeping the headset with you at home or office.  As of this writing, the Sony is ~$45 and the Jabra is ~$60.  You may find the Jabra cheaper but even at $60 it's DEFINITELY a better value than the Sony!

If you're looking for a really great sounding bluetooth set (i.e. for listening to music), I've been really happy with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Motorola-HT820/dp/B000E6MJW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Motorola HT820</a>.  It has two speakers and wraps around the back of your head/neck.  Fair warning, though- the Motorola sounds awesome but the speakers are huge and wearing this set makes you look like a total dork.

There are hundreds, maybe even thousands of bluetooth headsets out there so no matter which one you finally choose, please just don't make it this Sony piece of junk.

It is simply the score that the terribly lacking DIGITAL Collector's Edition is receiving. In fact, if I could give it zero stars, I would.

All this PC Download CE version does (other than cost a lot more) is give you the following in-game items: a level 20 Regal Frostlion Mount, a level 15 Velik's Bloodstone Necklace, and a level 40 Shakan's Bloodstone Necklace.
You don't get any digital artwork, maps, storybooks, or in game convenience benefits (such as a store bought level one mount). This so called Collector's Edition doesn't even give you any sort of cosmetic gear/pets or exclusive voices/appearances!

What makes this incredibly lacking package a Collector's Edition? En Masse Entertainment, I am asking you directly - why did you label this as such?
Coming from other digital CE's this version is quite disappointing.

The only difference between this digital CE and the regular version of Tera is the higher price tag and three useless items... If you feel that's worth it, by all means go ahead and purchase it (thus encouraging the developer to continue with these kinds of practices).

---------------------- My review of Tera (the base game) is below ----------------------

Tera is an action MMORPG, where auto attacking and tab targeting have been removed in favor of a much more fluid (and interesting) combat system. The game plays very much like your standard action game, and defeating enemies requires dodging, blocking, and being mobile. While you must still use a hotbar to trigger abilities, all of them have to be AIMED by you, and can be dodged just as easily by another skilled player (not by monsters, who have terrible, terrible AI). This results in some of the best PvP action I have ever encountered.

All is not well however, as the game has quite a few broken quests at this very moment. They recently merged all their servers into just three (the PvP only Mount Tyrannas, the PvE only Tempest Reach, and the Roleplaying server Celestial Hills). This merge created a myriad of problems and broken quests for the team at Enmasse Studios. I tried playing a freshly made toon just for the purpose of this review and found that I could not progress through the prologue because of a quest glitch. Moreover, skipping the prologue and going to the newby area, I was again halted by a quest MOB not spawning - and this once more prevented progression. There were about 20 people trying to finish this story quest (you NEED to complete them), and swearing about the game being a bug filled mess.
Logging on with my higher level characters, I was told there were quite a few more bugs in game after the merge (I asked in guild chat), and a lot of them impede progression.

The Good:

- Tera is incredibly gorgeous on the highest settings, of course you need a beefy computer to run it. My TimelineU M5-481TG-6814 can't handle it on medium or above, while running games like Skyrim on the high settings.

- The combat is amazing. I love that auto attack and targeting has been removed. This is by far the best combat in any MMORPG that I have played, and I played a lot of them. The thrill you get from dynamically dodging or blocking (and countering) your opponent's attack adds a lot to the overall feel of things.

- Environments and creature design are outstanding. Whoever created the world of Tera should be praised for a job well done. Everything from lush, rolling landscapes, to the mobs and races that inhabit it are all top notch. My only complaint about the races, is that all the females look like slutty supermodels (or borderline illegal for the Elin race).

- There are lots of ways to customize your characters (however there are also some limitations - such as not being able to make a purely bald character).

- Interesting progression system where you glyph your skills to modify them (there are usually quite a few choices to pick from), and lots of ways to improve your gear (crystals, enchantments, etc).

- Fighting BAM's (big ass monsters) is incredibly fun (and they live up to their name). Killing a BAM is like hunting similar creatures in the excellent Monster Hunter games, but a bit more challenging. For all you MH fans out there, do yourself a favor and roll a Berserker - that way you should be able to solo most BAM's. That is my main, and the only character that I can solo most BAM's with (adding to the MH feel).

- Server merges make for incredibly populated servers. There are countless players running and fighting all around you.

- The world PvP is pretty good, and actually exists in Tera, as does GvG (Guild VS Guild) and Battlegrounds.

- You can play for free, just like in Eve by purchasing a Chronoscrolls for in game money. You can also buy one from Amazon and sell it for in game funds. I haven't payed for Tera ever since this system was introduced a while back.

The Bad:

- There are generally only three quest types in Tera (of the fetch, escort, and slay variety). All MMORPG vets are familiar with these ""staples"" of the genre. Eventually PQ's do make an appearance, but by that time it is already too late.
With the evolution that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-World/dp/B007VTVKG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret World</a>&nbsp;has brought to the genre, playing Tera (or any other MMORPG for that matter just feels stale).

- Plenty of broken quests after the server merge.

- Grinding, grinding, and did I mention grinding? The best way to level up is still to repeat grind quests in key areas while queuing for dungeons. There is a huge drop off in the leveling speed at 40, and then again at 50. Getting up to 40 however is pretty simple.

- The game does not deserve its M rating. It simply doesn't push the boundaries like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Age-of-Conan-Hyborian-Adventures/dp/B000RZPW9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures</a>&nbsp;or make you think like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-World/dp/B007VTVKG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret World</a>. Other than the nude patches that are floating around the net, there is nothing too inappropriate in Tera. When a game is rated M, I expect it to handle that rating with more than just skimpy dresses.

- Tera's story is absolute generic garbage. Everything from the poorly voiced cutscenes to the terrible text. I tried to read the whole thing my first time through, but eventually succumbed to the ultra fast ""accept quest and move on"" mode.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-The-Old-Republic/dp/B001CWXAP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-World/dp/B007VTVKG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret World</a>&nbsp;really handle this a LOT better. This is disappointing since I actually loved the Tera books.

The Ugly:

- Tera is dying. Unless they switch to F2P post haste, I am afraid that even the three current servers will not fill up. My guild, which consisted of hundreds of members months ago, is now down to 17-20 active ones. The merges helped quite a bit, but I don't know for how long.

- The AI of some MOBs in this game is unbelievably laughable and makes the monsters in WoW seem like brain surgeons. You can exploit terrain and class skills to no end when it comes to certain encounters.

Conclusion:
Honestly it would be a mistake to not try this game out. It comes with 30 days of playtime, and if you do everything right it should be the only money you will need to spend (just purchase Chronoscrolls for in game cash).

I liked Tera at first, I really did but as time progresses and I experienced other games, I couldn't help but give the game a three star rating. If you have never played an AMMORPG before, feel free to add an extra star to my review, but with the competition being what it is - I can't recommend this game too much. In fact, if it wasn't for my addiction hunting BAM's and world bosses, I would have probably completely moved on by now.

I bought my first madden game the year this one came out (madden 08).  A little later on I got madden 09 All-play.  Then I decided to buy this one at Wal-Mart to see if it was better than last year.  I purchased it not even bothering to look at the back of the box, which explained the graphical issues that I will discuss later and tried to make them sound fun and exciting.  They explain them quote, ""Built from the ground up, a stunning new visual style designed exclusively for Wii brings players and stadiums to life like never before!""  Stunning? Yes. Bring them to life? NO.  Let me say it was the worst thing I ever spent $30 on.

I practically got home, turned it on, and said, ""Are you kidding me.""  I thought madden 09's graphics were bad! It looks like something from Shrek! But worse! For those that don't have the game(and I pray you won't), I will explain exactly what it looks like.

Graphical issues 1-12:

#1: Players do not have fingertips.
#2: Their hands look like they are wearing winter mittens.
#3: All players (except the linemen) look to weigh around 65 lbs. (besides the shoulder pads which I will get to)
#4: Players can still run through things such as stadium walls, goalposts, each other, etc.
  (and I'm just getting' started here)
#5: Now their heads I will have to spend some time on, unlike the graphic designers at EA.
  It looks like someone shrunk what used to be a football helmet and stuck it on the most disgusting, bloated, undersized, repelling, mushroom-like, excuse for a human head.  Those people at EA Sports must know that there were better football games a decade ago.  I wouldn't complain about last year's heads, but I couldn't, repeat, COULDN'T help noticing these. Now, on to #6.
#6: The players elbows can strangely fold in half like paper.
#7: The stadiums are like a toy house from some old Saturday morning cartoon. (maybe worse)
#8: Now for the pads;
  (They are practically the only thing you can see on the player's body)
  If you got all dressed up in in a really tight football uniform and started sticking cats and dogs and whatever you could find up around your shoulders, you would then have madden 10 shoulder pads.
  The leg pads remind me of a blown-up washboard sticking six inches out from the player's thigh. (Note; I'm being completely serious)
#9: The game has not added any new tackling animations.
#10: In this game, ""The ball carrier"" should be renamed and be called ""The ball magnet."" For Cryin' out loud! The ball just sticks to his forearm!  It doesn't remotely look like he's trying to hold on to it, 'cause he just knows that it will always stick to his trusty ol' arm magnet.
#11: Whenever a big hit occurs, the ball ""magnet"" is acting as though he were sitting in an electric chair.  The screen shakes and goes wild, while the player flails his arms and lies on the ground.
#12: It may not bother anyone else but I noticed that every single God forbidden player wears eye black... even indoors!

Now I will explain the gameplay.

The first thing I noticed when I began playing a game was obviously the graphics, but also that it was ten times slower than last year.  The biggest problem with that is that you can't change it.  It is very slow to react to your controls, unlike last year.  On the pause menu during a game there are half as many gameplay settings and not as many camera options.  The kick meter is oh so frustratingly slow, but then again you can't have a snail pace game and a regular speed kick meter.  Plus, since I have been playing madden 08 and 09 for a few years I am not a fan of the point and pass system.  If there are, let's say, four WR/TE/RB out for a pass and one of them is open you will then click on him and flick the remote to pass.  The problem is that the pointer is way too big and you could easily click on a heavily covered receiver by accident and be at the CPU's mercy.

I'm also not a fan of the main menu play.

They have completely removed all access to management of the NFL rosters.  This is what frustrates me the most, being that I like to play with updated rosters.

I am trying to think of something positive, and the only thing I can recall is that they have the '09 rookies on this game.

I strongly urge you to never waste your money on this game.

Great Idea
Original and Unique
Very Badly Done
I rented this game with no instructions.  The first thing I noticed was that there was a tutorial.  This tutorial was slow torture, but I learned some things.  Then I started the game.  The Graphics were pretty good, and I sensed that some great stuff was going to happen.  I started off nicely, explored around, and I got killed.  So I started again, explored some other parts, and got killed again.  This time I decided to avoid getting killed.
That's when this game got dull.  Really, really dull.  I played for two hours, painfully walking from one place to another.  The fighting, though interesting at first, was monotonous.  The setting soon became boring.  Worst of all, I wanted to save.  For the love of Goodness I kind not find out how to save.  The controls and tutorials taught me everything else but how to do.  After playing for three hours straight, I turned off my PS2, hoping the game was saved automatically.  It wasn't, and I wasn't going to repeat those three hours of gameplay, so I said forget it.
I promptly returned it to the video store, hoping that the few hours that the game resided in my house didn't lower my property value.  This game was cheap.  First of all, there were no voices at all.  Voice actors are not expensive, yet they couldn't even afford that.  Secondly, there is no compass.

The best thing one can say about this game is that it is a good idea, executed very poorly. As someone who is interested in the idea of using a sandbox game as a story-telling engine this game was a compelling purchase (though i still held off on getting it until i could purchase it for 3 bucks from the steam post christmas sale). Unfortunately after a few hours of playing it, i've found that what really lets this game down is the game. It over uses cut scenes (constantly usurping control), it handles like arse (regardless of your inclination to vehicles or being on foot) & the combat is ardious: Any game that requires me to pin point shoot a target sure as hell better give me a responsive enough set of controls to actually achieve the result.

But most damning is the fact that this game is not a open world sand box, so much as it is a rail shooter set on a open world sand box map. Apparently there are two ways to do every mission:
1. The way the game wants you to do it.
2. The way that restarts the mission so you can do it the way the game wants you to do it.

Early on Dungeons makes some snarky references to both Diablo and Dungeon Keeper, but from there that is where the similarities end.  Early objectives aren't clear, you place items but you're not exactly sure WHY you're placing them.  Hotkeys will frequently vanish, forcing you to re-open your spellbook and rebind the hotkey over and over.  Movement is erratic, although WASD is common for movement, you can let go of the W-key and your character continues to move forward.  Sometimes when going in a straight line, he'll start ""wiggling"" back and forth for no apparent reason.

Right off the bat know that if you have ANY issues with the game support is going to be difficult to come by.  The game's forums are all in german.  Email support is spotty at best, even when I sent off a copy of my dxdiag, the first email I got back... requested I send my dxdiag.  The technical issues I had were choppy sound.

Ergonomics:

This mouse takes a while to get use to, the way you grip it is different then a typical mouse. Its by no means superior to a normal shaped mouse, and so the steep learning curve (many days) is truely a negative.

The button placement on the right side are such that they are next to useless.

The save feature sucks and sometimes you will beat endless pit levels get tons of stars for star world only to find that it didn't save and you have to start over.  It only saves if you beat an entire world or you manually do it which is total bs.  The multiplayer is the worst I have ever seen in any game ever.  It's a total mess, virtually unplayable with more than two players and even then it's super frustrating because players can cut each others jumps short when jumping at the same time, jump on other players heads driving them into pits, pushing each other off ledges, hit each other with items, kill the other players if you run ahead of them even slightly, die if the other players run ahead or are too far behind you, glitch kill the other players if anyone dies as it freezes all other players for a second if one dies.  If you freeze glitch near an enemy it's game over or if in mid jump it glitch drops you straight down.....hence killing you instantly as 99% of the levels with exception of level 1 world 1 are pits.  The multiplayer in this game is ""trip over the other players feet"" style which I hate just like Battletoads on NES.  For a simple Mario game the controls are mangled, unresponsive and sometimes have a damn mind of their own.  The layout is simple but the response time from the game doesn't match the buttons your pushing most of the time and you end up dead. I have still yet to figure out if the game was made this way or not.  The sliding around, the delayed or no jump sometimes when you hit jump while running and terrible hit detection combined with the 99% pit levels is maddening at times.  I fail to see how this game is for kids, if more than one is playing this at the same time they will probally choke eachother...even single player is to difficult for kids with all the precision pit jumping required.  The cut scenes could have been so much better and actually have effort put into them rather then having the same exact scene 12 times when you beat castles.  I have beaten the game from start to finish worlds 1-9 three times over and overall it was a frustrating as hell experience due to the games horrid controls, mangled hit detection, tired endless pit levels and savagely crippled multiplayer.  The lack of innovation here also took away from this game as it is a carbon copy of New Super Mario Bros DS.

The game play itself is really great and the graphics are awesome. It's too bad that after 30-50 turns the game becomes unplayable due to performance and you'll never get to actually finish a game that you start.

People will argue that Steam isn't DRM but that's exactly what it is. I have the game on CD with the expansion. I can't install them though because steam doesn't work right. The game won't install while Steam is offline, so why do I have a disc? I don't know. When I go online, steam won't connect because either their servers are down or windows firewall blocks something (although I doubt that since I turned it off, but that's what steam says). People who pirated the game are playing it right now, probably reading this post and laughing because their copies just work and they didn't pay $50 for the first DVD and $50 for the expansion like I did. Of course the joke is on everyone because the game runs slow even on higher end systems. I have a friend running a PC with 32GB of RAM and two NVIDIA 680's in SLI with a 256GB SSD and even on that beast of a machine the game crawls to a screaching halt of performance after about 40 turns.

The character creation is very cool and had me ready to hop in game and test everything out.  The first thing you'll notice is the character's are difficult to see in game, so my friends really couldn't make out my cool Fallout gear I got from pre-ordering from Best Buy. I normally buy 90% of my games from Amazon, but really wanted the Fallout exclusive stuff. I had to find a very lit up area for them to really be able to see anything cool I added to my character.

Secondly it is a GIANT pain to try and join or get friends to join when you first get the game.  There isn't a lobby system, so one person has to start the campaign and then invite the others and the others don't get to see the first main cut scenes, which takes away from the experience.

Once in game its pretty chaotic.  You can accept different objectives, which is cool, but can be a bit overwhelming at times when there is a lot going on.  The campaign is very short.  My friend and I completed the Resistance part in just a few hours.  The challenges proved to be just as short.  We both completed all the challenges in an hour or so.

So, after completing the challenges quickly and then beating the Resistance side of the campaign quickly we figured the game must really shine in multi player.  WRONG!!! We tried 10+ games and EVERY ONE was so laggy that we backed out.  I never had one multiplayer experience where we finished a round.  I would like to note that we play multi player games almost daily and NEVER have lag issues with any other game.

Clark,"I'm a big fan of Razer mice; the DeathAdder is easily one of the most comfortable and accurate bare-bones mice I've ever owned, and the Naga is something every MMO gamer should give a try. I picked up this Anansi to replace a dying Logitech G15, expecting something of similar quality and usability, but unfortunately after a day of using it I'd have to say it's one of the worst gaming products I've ever bought.

The good:
The software is easy to set up, and works very well; it's familiar to anyone who's used the Naga, as the macro and customization is mostly identical. The backlight on the board is also really nice, and allows you to customize the color it displays in the same as the backlighting on Alienware's laptops.

The bad:

Everything else.

The modifier keys would be useful, but they're not easily reachable and are sectioned off in a way that offers no tactile feedback as to which you're actually hitting. They're also the only part of the keyboard that isn't backlit, and they really need to be. Unfortunately, I just can't see them being really useful; same with the modifier keys on the far left of the board, which have the same problem as those on the Logitech gaming boards...they're just not in the path of anything that makes them fast enough to hit accurately when playing a game.

The sticky key complaints are the biggest factor, though, and it's absolutely inexcusable for a gaming board to have this problem. I only used the board for two days, and had enough frustration with keys being stuck on a function after hitting with another key that I was fed up almost instantly with the keyboard. This just should not happen on a gaming keyboard. It doesn't happen on a $20 OEM board that's made for business use, so on a $100 board designed for gaming... if it was very occasional, or rare, maybe I could deal with it but not multiple times per gaming session.

Since upgrading to Windows 10, there is a 50% chance that the side buttons' mapping will not be recognized; I would be willing to bet it has something to do with the ""default profile"" having to swap over from the mouse's internal default upon Windows startup. A reboot of the computer is the only way to resolve the issue, and even still it's a 50/50 shot (sometimes takes two to three reboots to fix).
I have tried the following troubleshooting steps, per the Corsair forums at [...]
 - Uninstalled and reinstalled Corsair Utility Engine software
 - Tried each USB port on my computer
 - Ensured I am using the most up-to-date CUE
 - Verified all side buttons are properly mapped to their corresponding physical keys (I have mine bound to NumPad 0-9 as well as NumPeriod and NumMinus)
 - Navigated to my system's Control Panel > Device Manager > Uninstalled Corsair Composite Virtual Input Device, removed and reinserted USB, then restarted CUE

I had very high hopes for this mouse, and everything else works fine; the color schemes, the mouse wheel, and the DPI buttons work as advertised based upon how you have your DPI settings stored in the CUE. However, the side buttons are a necessity, and seeing as there are multiple requests in Corsair's forums to fix this issue and nothing's been done to fully resolve it, I have to chalk this up to a $60 waste of money.

1.0,False,"05 20, 2012",AFLRU6952DEFX,B00178630A,S.,"I've sat through an hour and a half of Diablo III, and honestly, it was boring.

Maybe I'm a bit cynical, but I kind of saw all of this coming, from the first point hearing about the healing orbs (aka power ups) to the DRM fiasco.  Most if not all the original makers of the Diablo franchise left Blizzard years ago for other companies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Torchlight/dp/B001B5U80K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Torchlight</a>/ Torchlight 2), leaving a crew that's basically made WoW.  Unfortunately for them, that ship, WoW, has pretty much run its course.  With regards to D3, the criticism is not really a case of ""this isn't Diablo [II] enough"" but rather, this is all the bad sides of D2, with none of the good aspects (namely character customization and sort of a sandboxey go-where you like when you like feeling.  D3 100% linear guided tour, no choices, game on rails.).

Take D2.  You had to grind through 2 difficulties before you got to the ""real"" difficulty level where all the good stuff dropped and the tough battles ensued.  Doing those quests for a the millionth time really sucked but hey, that's what you had to do.  And you decided which quests you wanted to do, and sometimes in what order, and could go pretty much wherever you wanted whenever you wanted as long as you killed the act bosses.  Only this time, in D3, you have to grind through 3 difficulties before you get to the final one.  At least this time they shortened the time it takes, but in a way that's a negative as well just because there is hardly 60 bucks worth of content.  In D2 the loot made things interesting, but in D3 the loot is super randomized and always improving but doesn't feel special.

Think about it... would you rather play 60 hours of content on one difficulty level, or play 15 hours of content, four times repeated?  The second option sounds boring, and maybe in my misspent youth I would have gone for it, but now I think gamers know better.  Skyrim is looking like A LOT better value right now and at least is a real role-playing game. A roleplaying game is one where you take a risk, you invest in certain skills and skip others, and your character is a unique creation; you might have picked a good combo, or maybe not, but it was still your choice, your experiment.  In Diablo III, it's a socialist dystopia where everyone is perfectly equal and perfectly the same and perfectly boring.  If you want a character progression and choice over your path, don't just walk, run away from this title.

Diablo III is a game inspired by RPGs, even the interface and town interiors look ripped from Baldur's Gate.  But the game itself really has more in common with Contra or Metal Slug, 2d shooter style games where you run around, shoot the baddies, get the power-up, etc etc.  The rune system later in the game makes this a little more complex, but is sorta like Contra where you earned different ways of shooting - everyone has access to the exact same runes (skill tweaks) at any time, and you can change them at the drop of a hat.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

Diablo III looks like a mishmash of Warcraft III, World of Warcraft, and Diablo.  It can't quite decide whether it wants to be scary or cute and colorful, so it does both. The monsters and scorched ground areas look ripped from the undead campaigns in Warcraft III.  Honestly, if someone had told me this was some sort of super mod for that game, I might have believed them, as the game looks more like I'd expect a Warcraft game than Diablo.  The Grotesque monsters, for example, are supposed to be nasty things that scratch and claw and then blow themselves up into a bloody mess.  But instead they look like Kirby from the Nintendo games or mini versions of the Stay Puffed Marshmellow Man from Ghostbusters.  Seriously, the monsters are for the most part just WoWish and don't look like they belong in a traditional fantasy universe (like Dungeons and Dragons).

In the end, I can't believe it took them so long to develop what is essentially maybe 15-20 hours of content, strung along through repeated difficulties.  I'm sure someone will play this for hundreds of hours trying to get a marginally different styled armor for their cookie cutter character (since now there are really only as many character builds as there are character types).

You can take Blizzard's side and say that ""streamlining"" the game was good, but in reality, every character is exactly the same looking and acting, minus whatever differences in gear happen.  All female wizards for example look EXACTLY alike and have no customization of skills, appearance, face, hair, etc., etc, and if you've seen one, you've seen them all.  This was acceptable in 2000, not in 2005 and certainly not now.  Neverwinter Nights, Guild Wars, and Elder Scrolls games all always offered more depth of who your character was. No replayability.

I guess we can face it that this is an action game with customizable armor, but where apparently the physical damage of a held weapon determines your ability to shoot fire and lighting from your palms.  I'm sure someone will say that makes choosing a weapon easier, but it just makes the game make no sense, unless you look at it from the perspective of the developers not having the time or creativity to actually develop a convincing attack bonus system for casters.

In a way, the makers are lucky that people are locked out of the game.  Everyone wanted more from D3 than they remembered from D2, and I think most people got much less than they were hoping for.  Bad voice acting, bad storyline, and neat but ultimately forgettable cinematics (probably the cause of all the delay -- Blizzard having to pay for and film the equivalent of a movie within a game).  A game that can't really decide if it's a single player game or an MMO, so it tries to do both and doesn't truly suceed.  This is MMO-light, probably for people who sadly don't have the experience to know what this game is missing.

If this wasn't rentware, I'd give it 2 stars for at least having town interiors that reminded me of classic Bioware games. I haven't said much about the DRM and heavy server lag because everyone already knows the game is going to be somewhat crippled for a little while longer until either more people quit or Blizzard improves capacity.  I think it will be a fun game a year or two from now when it is patched and everything is rethought and the price is cut.  It is simply unplayable (lag, disconnects, 40 minutes of lost progress) at random times, and that's why my review is 1 star instead of 2 stars.

Until then, save your money, and buy something else.  D3 just isn't in the same league as the other games mentioned, and it just isn't worth paying that much for a temporary game that will be unplayable the day Blizzard decides to pull the plug on their servers, which could be tomorrow or could be 10 years from now (the mighty can fall - just look at the banks and GM).

In the end, you aren't paying for a game, you're paying for a subscription to their (laggy) servers, a MMORPG without the RPG and without the MM.

Too bad, they all take a backseat to new silent protagonist Ludger.  While having a silent protagonist that makes dialogue choices works in RPGs with custom characters, it doesn't fit here and it gets old incredibly fast.  The skits are the most noticeable part where it's lacking as everyone talks at him or to him and his response is just ""...."" or *gasp.*

Did you like playing as your favorite character as well and look forward to seeing how they changed? Too bad, Ludger is ridiculously OP and has a ""God Mode"" transformation that you turn into during the fights after filling a meter.  He's the only one with this mode so the game practically requires you to play as him exclusively.  Luckily, since you have to play as him all the time they gave him three weapon sets so he can be agile fighter, heavy hitter, ranged and basically do everyone's jobs for them as well.

Were you looking forward to a new story? Well it's hidden behind an in-game paywall.  Not with real currency mind you, but a fake in-game debt system that you are literally reminded about every few minutes to make a payment on.  To earn money for this you have to do side quests/jobs constantly and throughout the game like ""go kill this many monsters"", ""go collect items from these enemies.""  You're basically being forced to play an MMO just to be rewarded with more of Ludger's story only, because all the other characters' stories are optional side quests you have to be on the lookout for or you'll miss them.

I've been an EA sports- NBA Live fan for over 8 years now. Playing it on all the major systems; like, Playstation, PC's, Genesis, Super NIN, etc.. So I'm a devoted NBA Live fan. This game is a complete disgrace to the series! You can tell that they rushed the product to compete with other games that came out the same time; like, ESPN NBA 2 Night and NBA Hoopz.
Okay, let's go over the Pro's of the game. Yes it's got Michael Jordan in it, and yes it's got classic legendary teams on it. Overall though, I don't think that balances out the Con's of the game. The biggest disappointment being the response time from when you hit the buttons, to the time it actually does the movement. You can press the button to shoot the ball, and release it before it even does it on the screen. It's that bad! The movements are pretty choppy also, it's not fluent. You can be driving to the hole, and it would be real sluggish. Also, the percentage ratio of making a basket is EXTREMELY low! You can be wide open for a 5 foot jump shoot, and completely miss 10 shots! You pretty much have to dunk it to score. Another big con are the players. Yes, the body shape fits the actual players, but none of the faces look anything like the players at all! I rather take a buffed out Reggie Miller with a face that matches (like in NBA 2K1 for the Dreamcast), rather then the actual shape of a skinny Reggie Miller with the face of a complete stranger. What...some more Con's? Well, they took out the Franchise mode, from previous games, as well as the 3 point contest. Why, I don't know? Next year, they should bring back the Slam Dunk contest on the game (remember Jordan vs. Bird?). Just like they brought back fighting in hockey games!
So overall, the game wasn't worth the $49.99. I thought it would match up with the same quality as NBA 2K1 for the Dreamcast, (like Madden 2001 for PSX2 and NFL2k1 for Dreamcast), but it doesn't even come close.

Mostly because after a bit of playing, the sound has quit, or clicking the menu bar brings up nothing or challenges state ""You need ?? and ?? to get 'whatever' (?? being blank spaces or filled with gobbledygook)"" or things simply get out of whack and I quit, only to find there is no contact with the server.

This has higher privileges than the administrator account, meaning you can't uninstall it in ANY WAY, even if it interferes with other parts of your system. And interfere it does, as it disables or causes problems with legitimate CD burning and CD ROM emulation software, and has been reported to have conflicts with anti-viruse software. And uninstalling the game does nothing to remove the SecuRom code... EA apparently feels it has the right to just install this software on your machine and leave it there, whether you want it or not. The software acts as a rootkit and may introduce security holes, and the only way you can get it off is to re-install windows.

Next, consider that SecuRom limits your activations of the product to five. Yes, five. Anyone who has owned Command and Conquer games in the past has usually found them good enough to keep playing off and on for several years. But you can't do that with this product, because re-installing Windows counts as a major change and costs another activation. Upgrading a computer and changing certain parts uses activations. And before you know it, you will have none left (who hasn't re-installed Windows many times over the course of several years?). EA claims that you can just call them up and they will let you have another activation if you run out, but what if you have five EA games with SecuRom on them (like Spore, which only had three activations)? Do you really want to keep calling them up every time and asking if they will let you use the games you paid 50 bucks a-peice for? Additionally, given that their tech support line is NOT free and is $2.50 a minute, do you want to sit on hold waiting for a new activation and get charged that amount of money for a game you already paid for?

I've had it with EA and their shenanigans and rent-ware. I will NEVER buy an EA game again until it is 100% free of DRM. I won't pirate their games, but I won't pay them a dime until I, the paying customer, have the same rights and ease of use that the pirates are enjoying with their cracked, SecuRom free versions of the game! Until then, I will only play games from DRM free manufacturers, such as Stardock Software (maker of Galactic Civilizations and Sins of a Solar Empire, which are selling just fine despite lack of DRM).

2. Softcore porn in the cut scenes
Last but not least, I have issue with what is essentially softcore porn in the cut scenes. If EA would drop the DRM, I would buy other Command and Conquer games in the future, but not ones like this. I don't think this is right for my children or myself.

In this game, if you watch the trailer, you will find that apparently the army has relaxed dress codes enough that the American female officer that briefs you in the cut scenes can wear the front of her uniform unbuttoned all the way down to the table (where we can't tell how much farther it goes). Also in the trailer, you can see Tanya the special agent slitting people's throats while wearing little more than a super tight, midriff revealing tank/tube top and extremely short shorts/underwear. Coloring them army green really doesn't change the fact that she's wearing something that could easily appear in an underwear/lingerie type add.

I'm disappointed, because the gameplay itself looked great, but I won't let the sexual content I saw in the trailers (and there is probably much more of it, the Russians are usually worse than the Americans) into my house. And quite frankly, it is also disappointing because this game had an absolutely first rate group of actors in the cutscenes, such as George Takei and others, and having the sexual content in there detracts from the realism and of the game. I mean, what military lets female officers go around with their shirts unbottoned, let alone dresses its agents on the battlefield as hookers?

Removing military formality and discipline and replacing it with an adolescent's sexual fantasy really does destroy the atmosphere the game could have had (and did have, in scenes that just had actors like George Takei in them). Sorry EA, but until you clean your game up and drop the DRM you won't get my money.","Bad DRM, softcore porn material in cut scenes",1231718400,15,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

I figured that with all the experience I had just built up with Star Wars, donning the Lego version of the famous hat would be also be a rollicking good time.  Nope!

At first I thought my displeasure was due to the new control options, such as switching characters regardless of distance and all the new items you can pick up and use like shovels, wrenches, weapons and puzzle pieces.  However, my frustration continued to mount.  I managed to finish all the levels for the first film, but the feeling was largely one of relief instead of triumph.  When I began playing the levels for Temple of Doom, I got so irritated with the punitive, non-intuitive game play that I decided to go back and Free Play in the Raiders levels.

That didn't work for several reasons,which I've listed below:

- Overall, the level design is surprisingly small and uninspired after the often epic scope of Star Wars.  There is rarely a feeling of majesty or amazement, many of the levels feel cramped and somehow unfinished.  In many of the Star Wars levels I found myself just stopping and just admiring what I was looking at.  That didn't happen once in any of the Indy levels, which is unforgivable given how many amazing widescreen vistas there are across the trilogy.

- The rate of accidental death is WAY to high.  I guess the programmers thought that players should really feel like Indy in this game, so they take advantage of every opportunity to abuse the player.  With only a whip to start, you get shot and killed a LOT.  Even leaping directly into the fray every time will not save you from bullets.  Picking up a pistol instead of a shovel or a torch in the heat of battle is a losing gamble, and you die some more.  Why can't you whip the weapons out of enemies hands?!

- It's WAY to easy to kill yourself without meaning to.  One of the key moves of the Indy character in the game is to punch things apart to get studs.  However, each time you punch, Indy takes a step.  Well, if you're standing near a cliff, you can punch your way right into the abyss.  No player would do this intentionally, and neither would the character, so the fact that this is possible is to me symptomatic of lazy and/or cruel programming.

- The level design is uninspired.  The Map Room scene in Raiders is one of my favorites, yet it's only a cut scene.  Why not make this part of a level where Indy has to decode which hole in which to put the Staff of Ra before heading off to the Well of Souls?  I enjoyed all the activities in the submarine hangar near the end, but they could have added a whole sequence of Indy navigating the rocky canyons of the island in order to catch up with Belloq and the Ark.  Another potential level portion relegated to a cut scene.

- The opening level of Temple of Doom has horribly non-intuitive puzzle moments, one in involving a giant gong.  What is so surprising is that the game provides hints of what to do earlier, but nothing for this particular one.  After looking it up, I realized that I would have had to watch the movie immediately prior to playing this level to figure out the next move.

I cannot recommend this game.  It feels like SO half-hearted.  None of the inspiration clearly present in the Star Wars Complete Saga is present here.

1.  I am a HUGE Borderlands fan.  Loved 1 and 2.
2. Unlike some other reviewers, I also really like this one. (yes, I know this is contradictory, but stay with me).
3. I have a PS4 and hadn't purchased any new PS3 games since I purchased the PS4 (right when it came out).  Until this game came out.
4. I was completely perplexed when I saw the announcement that this title was going to come out ONLY on PS3 and XBOX360 (look it up, all the articles are still there).  I would say I was probably on the brink of being pi**ed.  I vowed to not purchase it, just for that reason.
5. I purchased it anyway and played it for a while despite the fact that I usually only use my PS4.  I finally gave up on it because it was too much of a hassle to fire up my PS3.
Up to this point, no issues.  I decided on my own to buy the game even though I was mad that they were not putting it on the PS4.
6.  THEY ARE PUTTING OUT A PS4 VERSION NOW.
If they want to change their minds, fine, but they have to recognize the fact that less than 6 months ago, I purchased this game for the PS3 after being told it would not come out on the PS4.  Honest mistake?  I think not.  They knew they would only sell PS4 versions to people who already had a PS4, but ""how can we sell the PS3 version AND the PS4 version to the same person, even if they already have a PS4????""  Like this!
So how can they fix this?  Give us a credit.  Not ""just trade it in"".  Right now this game for the PS3 will get me all of $7 and some odd cents for a trade in.  Let us return our fully working copies of the PS3 version to the manufacturer and get a credit (I would say at least $20 would be fair, but it should be more).
UPDATE:  I just posted this review a few minutes ago and then went back to the product page only to find out that I can now get $16.91 for a trade-in.  I have no idea why it went from under $8 yesterday to almost $17, but I am going to trade it in now.  BUT that still doesn't excuse the developers since this is Amazon that is giving me the trade in credit.

The only good thing is that the saved games I have from TPS on the PS3 will port to the PS4, but that does not make up for the fact that I would have waited for the PS4 version if I knew it was going to come out.
By the way, don't bother saying that this is not a true PS4 port.  I don't know if it is or not and it DOES NOT MATTER.  The point is, regardless whether or not the game is just a PS3 quality game on the PS4, it's all about the ability to play the game on my PS4 where I do all my other gaming.  I would DEFINITELY have waited the 6 months for the convenience of playing it on my PS4 if I knew it was going to come out.

UPDATE:  I just got my copy of The Handsome Collection for the PS4, and I found out that in order to transfer my saved games from the PS3, I needed to update my PS3 version (WHICH I NO LONGER HAVE) to the latest version in order to export the games so I can load them on to my PS4.
THANKS!  And just in case you think I pulled the trigger too early on trading the game in, it is now $12.61 to trade in vs. the $16.91 that I did get.

Needless to say I sent it back the same day.  And to think that I was considering buying it at one time!  Ech!

Okay, let's crack my knuckles and prepare to rant!  (Ha ha)

The biggest problem is how often you'll die in this game, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and... yeah, I think you get it.  As you're being chased by cops (who for some reason seem to commit the city's entire police force just to stop you), you need to be on the lookout for your escape route, that next jump, that next ladder, that next alley which will take you to the next checkpoint and one step closer to the level's goal.  The problem is that these key passages are devilishly well hidden, so it's all too easy to pass them right by and run face-first into a dead end.  So by the time you realize you overshot your escape route and turn back, you're cut off by the fuzz.  Oh, and did I mention the cops shoot?  Yes, they open fire on an unarmed, non-violent suspect.  And you drop dead after just a handful of hits.  Stopping to survey your surroundings isn't an option either, because the fast-moving cops are right on your arse; you need to be constantly moving if you don't want precious Faith painted red with her own blood.  Trying to fight the cops isn't the answer either since Faith is a lithe, agile athlete built for speed rather than combat; trying to engage a cop with her fists is suicidal, and will again get her painted red with her own blood.

So it's a cheap trial-and-error system that's in place: you'll get painted red repeatedly, replaying the same segments over and over again, trying to find the obscure key passage.  The hints that Merc, your boss, feeds you over your radio is completely useless, since he says redundant crap like ""Cops are coming!  Get out of that building now!"" or ""Get off that roof, Faith!  I don't care how; just do it!""  No, really?  Cops are coming?  Wow, Merc, you figure that out all by yourself?  Speaking of hints, holding down the hint button does nothing except to confuse you further because half the time it points in a completely random direction, nowhere near where you're actually supposed to go.

Wait... I'm not done!

The control scheme also suffers from bad design.  The ""Up Action"" function (which is the game's fancy-pants way of saying ""jump button"") is central to gameplay and the most frequently used function.  This function is mapped to the left bumper, one of the less reliable buttons on the 360 controller.  Your only alternative is the RIGHT bumper, the OTHER unreliable button.  Genius!

I give the developer, Dice, kudos for trying something new.  I really wanted to like this game because it was so different and new: the free-running premise, the MTV-style cartoon cutscenes, and the visual style of the city you inhabit are all fresh.  The city, in particular, is rendered in blinding, stark whites and grays which look artificial and sanitized.  This color palette does a good job of reinforcing the game's storyline wherein an all-powerful totalitarian government has established what seems like a utopia at first glance, but at the cost of all freedoms.  The concepts that Dice tried to implement are a breath of fresh air in the video game industry, but it's truly a shame the game's mechanics and design choices leave me frustrated and scratching my head.

It will however play music just fine.  I even tried playing music, then starting a call.  First it cut out the music, then the call, then a few seconds later the music cut back in.  That's reliability.

So I decided to download their drivers rather than relying on Windows 8.1 drivers.  Their drivers made all sound on my laptop useless.  Gone is the smart switch from the headset to the laptop speakers when I unplug the headset or the other way around.  So is the builtin ability to have a default sound system for playing music and a default system for communications.

Worst of all?  The drivers stop the ability to open Sound from Control Panel.  I rebooted, tried again, then went to uninstall their drivers/software.  Surprise, the Sound settings popped up on its own as soon as the it was uninstalled.  It was being held back by the software.  HORRIBLE programming.","Great sound, but major hardware and driver problems",1419897600,,,

graphically, the game looks nice but it only has one resolution of 800x600 so you see a limited view of your party's immediate area. the pathing AI during combat is horrendous, often taking a longer route than necessary... this sometimes leads to your character running by an enemy, giving them an attack of opportunity against you; this can also negate your ability to attack -- depending on how far you need to move to an enemy, you may or may not be able to attack, taking a longer route even though it initially shows an attack icon means a wasted move. it's also hard to position your character to score flanking attacks. the combat manual is almost too cumbersome, though hotkeying commands help.
i like the point-buy system of generating your character's ability score which is sanctioned by AD&D rules and a very fair way of managing your needs. but your character starting equiptment sometimes doesn't make sense. your characters generally have a range weapon, a bow or sling, but no ammuno... arrows are really hard to find and was not sold by the first trader you meet (i haven't come across another trader/shopkeeper so far), yet most of the orcs you meet will launch arrows at your party.
this game follows 3E rules but pre-determines each character's feats, skills and abilities without input from the player. the characters does not appear balanced, the ranger for instance does NOT have the ability to use dual weapons (no one can) making the class much weaker than other fighter classes; the favored-enemy is pre-selected (at least on level one).
getting to level 2 is fairly straight forward but getting from level 2-3 is TEDIOUS -- it feels like most of the enemies encountered rarely provide much experience points. sometimes the enemies seemed harder to fight because your characters are so weak -- at level 2 your will face shadows and wraiths and only one or two of your party will have magical weapons at that point; once you are in combat mode, there is no way to retreat.
since you HAVE to keep your party together, you also can't send one character to do advance scouting (this oversight will be a huge disappoint especially if you play the multi-player mode).
overall, this feels like an unfinished game that's more of a dungeon crawler (with lower resolution and much less loot) than a true RPG -- the plot line so far is fairly trite. i am just severely disappointed that this game is linked to the excellent gold box series -- maybe it's unfair to make the comparison but if you carry the name Pool of Radiance, you've got to deliver.",not since Ultima IX...,1002067200,5,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

I wouldn't recommend going out and buying a wii wheel for every controller. It's cumbersome. I felt I had better control of what I was doing without it. I tried to use my GC controller and was frustrated when  I found out the button layout was rearranged (from CG DD layout) with no way to modify them to a players liking.

Looks:

 I wasn't expecting Mario to be jumping out of the screen at me, but this game really doesn't look any better than Double Dash. I'm using a hd tv with component cables. The game could have been a bit more polished.

Game Play:

cheapness factor-
 The computer LOVES to time its Lighting, Spike Shell or POW to make sure you fall off a ledge or make it possible for you to lose your first place slot.

 Whats up with the rare weapons like Lighting and Spike Shell coming up multiple times in a race? In former games those were few and far between. Three lightnings in one race? WTH nintendo?

 I don't want to lose a race when I have done nothing wrong. That just seems to happen a lot in this game though. Multiple spike shells FTL!

No coop on Grand Prix-
 My brother and I enjoyed this feature in past games. This is huge step back for the series.

No free for all in Battle mode -
 You have to play on teams.

At the time, I had recently bought Perfect Dark for the N64, and I'd heard that the GBC version would use the Transfer Pak. Based on that, I bought the GBC game. Oops.
My first mistake was expecting an N64-type experience from this game, and that's simply not possible. Perfect Dark was so good for the N64 that it couldn't be translated well for the Game Boy. However, it could still be a good game in its own right. Well, it's not.

The sound is nothing spectacular, and while the cut scenes are interesting, the graphics themselves are poor. The cartridge also comes with a built-in Rumble feature, but that really doesn't add anything to the game other than weight.

Here were some of my biggest issues with the system (and by that I mean the console, Microsoft, and gaming companies):

1. I'm required to be on the Internet.
So basically I have to buy the system and have internet for it to even work. The original I could play even if the internet went down, now not so much.

2. Required to have Xbox Live.
Now this isn't a requirement for all games but a lot being manufactured these days require you to have Xbox Live to do anything more than the tutorials. Xbox Live $60 a year plus, $60 for a games = $120 to really get anything out of it.

3. Updates and game installation.
Seemed like any time I turned the system for the first week I would wait 15min for the it to update. On top of that I had to install the game on my system which took around 30 min. Plus once the game was installed and I find out I didn't like it, sorry no returns since the games can only be installed once.

I write this not to add insight of any kind. There has already been much of that and said better (See prior mention of Jim Sterling) than I posses the delivery and prose to convey. I post here to degrade an undeserving title of any kind of sale and to warn others from doing so. Whatever talent Keiji Inafune (who is incorrectly called by many including himself as the father of Mega Man) possesed when the original Mega Man Games were made and the team of current and former Capcom employees that worked on these games, that talent and skill has clearly waned and I will be skeptical to the point of cynical of any project he works on in future.",I backed this and I'm mad as hell,1487289600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

For some reason, when I single-click it registers a double-click instead, roughly 2/3 of the time.  I have tried new mouse drivers, no change.  I tried a new operating system (not just hoping to fix this problem, but because it was time for an upgrade) and it still does it.  I have tried using it on another computer.  STILL DOES IT.  I brought it back for an exchange then, thinking maybe it was a hardware issue but nope the new mouse (same model) DOES THE SAME THING.  I try to single click to select something; nope the mouse decides by itself that I actually wanted to double-click to activate the object instead.

Maybe it is crappy Chinese parts.  Maybe it is a problem with the design, how the clicker buttons have big grooves supposed to fit your fingers, maybe I'm hitting the left and right sides of that groove when I click so it literally is physically clicking twice.  I don't know.  All I know is, it's very annoying.

The story is well written and with the voice acting and somewhat fair character animation it adds a movie quality to the game.  There must be hours and even days of voice recordings for this game. Almost everything is spoken though out the story.
High points aside there are many shortfalls in this game. Not the least of which is that less than 30 minutes in to the game they are already trying to sell you an add-on mission.  While this is a interesting business model , I was displease to say the least with the idea of having just paid 60 dollars for the game only to find out 30 minutes in that I have to pay more(7-14 dollars per mission) to continue on and play certain missions.

The graphics engine looks like something written back in 2001. There are tons of jagged edges on everything. From squareish looking barrels to tree branches that grow at right angles there is little to impress in the graphics department in this game.  The different break points for the load screens are also poorly engineered. Any time you go in to any building at any point expect a one minute load screen. A well written graphics engine could easily dynamically load data on demand to virtual eliminate 90 percent of the load screens in this game. Instead you will find yourself running in to load screen every 5-15 minutes of game play. The engine for this thing is a relic.

The save system lacks a little to be desired as well it would be better it the autosave had several versions going back. It is easy to walk down a one way path in the story line with no way back.

The game allows your main character at several different points to make a choice between a Homosexual relationship and a Heterosexual relationship. There is also a lot of animation blood violence and blood magic in the game. As the rating suggest I would not recommend this game for anyone that is impressionable.

10 years in development!! an extremely long beta.... and this is what we get?
This game was finished in 1 year.. maybe 2 tops.. the rest was just to find a way to milk us the consumers out of our hard earned money ...RMAH.

World of warcraft is dead for me, the game holds no appeal for me anymore, I cant stand 5 minutes of it by now, and I know its just a personal issue..burnt out, but I have seen it more often than not with a lot of people..I guess they tried to make D3 their new cash cow.

I started playing the 2k series at 2011 but its was 2k12 that got me hook to this game. I just bought the game 2k13 at gamestop for $65 including tax( what a rip off, $60 for a game is overpriced and the tax literally heighten my anger) and I just want to return it asap. I feel my money is getting wasted. In nba 2k12 I reached all star lvl not to say im a pro but i play this game often. Im just expressing my views of the game no offense to anyone, Im a casual gamer and I hope this will help those who are debating about the game make a decision.

My list of pros and cons for 2k13:

Pros:
1) somewhat better graphic,thru i really didn't notice any major improvement or difference
2)Update roster (kind of the only reason I buy)
3)online play is more stable now

cons:

1)Minor control changes here and there (the ally hoop button change to a bad spot,sub,view,etc)
2)Notice the gameplay is not as fluid or rapid as 2k12 (idk if its just me or what i notice the players run really slow compare to 2k12?)
3)Too many Jayz ( don't get me wrong I love his songs but I don't want to only listen to one artist for the whole time I will be playing this game)
4)Last years covers is way better than this years (Im cool with d rose and durant, but BLAKE GRIFFEN? He is the most overratted dunk champion of all time and literally have no skills besides dunking) (FYI: LAST YEAR IS WAS JORDAN MAGIC AND BIRD....3 )
5)Too many decorations, not as real as the last one.
6)Shots selections are weird, felt like 2k make this game very complicated now (certain buttons activates certain more,etc)
7)SINCE I DIDN'T ""PREORDER"" THIS GAME IM NOT ENTITLE TO ALL STAR BONUS ETC,WHICH IS COMPLETELY BULLS BECAUSE I PAY FULL RETAIL FOR A BRAND NEW GAME AND IM STILL NOT ENJOYING THE WHOLE GAME.

CONCLUSION: If you want to buy this game I strongly suggest you go try this game at your local game store first before buying it. Be prepare to not have the all star bonus stuffs even thru you pay good money. Your best bet will be to wait till this game's price drop, its almost holiday season.

The graphics look amazing but that's the only plus. It does use the same dungeon crawler style but the enemies are downright pathetic, you're weilding a wrench as a weapon, not a sword. You pretty much die the moment you get hit. I recently put it back into my ps2 because I'd decided I never really gave it too much of a chance but it was a big mistake. It made me hate myself even more for wasting all that money and time. You'd be happier if you threw your money into an office shredder.  A giant elephant and a big fat clown with dynamite strapped to his half-naked body  (It's not the psychotic kind of clown you see  in horror movies either.) is hardly worth  fighting if at all and the story is utterly ridiculous. By the time max actually saw the outside world I expected the problem and solution to be explained but all we get is ""A bad guy destroyed the world and we don't know why."" They never even explain where the characters are going and why.

The races in the last game (Though underdeveloped as characters) were loads more interesting than anything I ever saw in this  poor excuse for a sequel. I played long enough to encounter the ""firbits"". Rip offs of the seven dwarves from snow white. (They even have you keep an eye out for a woman who appeared in their forest one day, made their lives better and mysteriously disappeared.) NOTHING about this game keeps the player interested.

You buy something like this because you want to protect your very expensive investment, but that's assuming there's a problem with the console overheating in the first place.  I don't believe that's the case--I've seen these things played for hours at a time without a cooler, and most of the consoles on display at local retailers, which are on for many hours, are not cooled externally.

Besides being (probably) unneccessary, however, the Intercooler is poorly designed.  The thing is bulky, though maybe that can't be avoided.  It's terribly loud as well--loud enough that you may not be able to use it on a PS3 if you're playing it late at night with the sound muted so you don't wake up the family.  There is a dial to adjust the fan speeds, but even on the minimum this thing sounds like some kind of mutated hairdryer.

It has it's own on/off switch, which also acts as a master switch for the PS3.  If you switch off the intercooler the console goes off as well, which could be a major issue if a game is saving or something.  Sleep mode for the PS3 works only if the Intercooler is still on (and roaring), and you can forget about turning the PS3's power off from your controller.

- Has the elements of a decent third person shooter.

Cons:

- Abysmal game mechanics do not mesh with the control settings, making sure you are having a hard time just trying  to get around a level.

- Buggy gameplay insures you get hit with as many cheap attacks as possible.

- Broken game mechanics make the game next to unplayable, such as blind fire being almost as accurate as aiming, melee attacks keeping enemies in a state of lock, and enemy attacks that knock you down in succession of each other.

- Awful lighting and color palette.  Each scene is taken up by a single color most of the time, making any sense of scale or depth impossible, and when that isn't happening, the game is pitch black, even with the gamma all the way up on a bright TV setting.

You should definitely read more reviews. The graphics are okay, but the design of the graphics in this game are considered to be very cartoonish by many. Bright oranges, glowing blues, and odd color assortments await you in this game. Do yourself a favor and search for the original Battlezone. That was a game I played so many years ago I can't even remember when, but I remember clearly the missions and the specific gameplay elements because it was so good. The story made more sense, the missions didn't tell you exactly what to do (you had to figure it out, which was the fun part), and the overhead map was accessible from the push of a button rather than getting out of your vehicle all of the time. To summarize what these reviews (on the first page) are all leaving out:
- You'll have to get out of your vehicle constantly. Because the drivers of other vehicles just aren't smart enough to do the job themselves. You'll also have to do this to access the tactical map, the only way of ordering units around without actually driving there (by which time the units in question will have already been destroyed, too little, too late)
- Missions aren't involving, and the story doesn't continue from the original game. In short, there's really not much of a story, as you'll find yourself doing strange things that you've been ordered to do for no apparent reason
- Interface is cluttered, buttons rearrange themselves based on the order that you built things, and it's a nightmare finding the right keys to press during the heat of battle.

In comparison I have the standard wireless controller that comes with the Xbox and a gamestop controller I picked up for a friend.  I wouldn't say the standard controller is bad, but the Onza seems to respond a little better, it may just be in my head.

The thing I don't care for is the huge wire, wish there were a way to make it shorter, considering I'm less than 5 ft from the xbox, the 15ft wiring is a little excessive. The additional shoulder buttons I found can be useful, but in all honesty, after using the standard controller, I sometimes press the new shoulder buttons on accident, so it takes some time to getting used to if you usually don't have so many buttons.

Overall I'd say this is a good product by Razor, and better than most 3rd-party controllers if not all 3rd party controllers.

Edit: After using this controller for a bit more, I can say one final con to this thing for me are the XYAB buttons.  They either require too much force to press, and if you use too much, it sends forward 2 signals so its like you pressed it twice.  So basically, sometimes it'll be like you didn't push the button at all, and other times it'll be like you pushed it twice.

1.0,False,"03 29, 2005",A2UQIQUOAB47OT,B000067FDW,DB,"When the game came out things worked pretty well.  The glowing reviews were well deserved.  But with each passing day since, the bugs and stability have gotten worse.  It has now gotten to the point that the servers go down everyday.  And each time the servers go down the length of time they are down gets longer. Most of the time the servers are down for a few minutes to a couple of hours. Today it is now approaching 12 hours downtime and that is for nearly half the servers and the most popular ones.  It wouldn't be that bad if the downtimes were when most people were not playing.  But the downtimes almost always occur in the evening at the peak player times.

  There are many bugs that many players know about and go unfixed.  It has become the old doctor joke.  You know, the patient says ""Doctor, it hurts every time I do this"" and the doctor says ""Don't do that"".  That is how many players play the game, there are many things we are supposed to be able to do but when we do it the game locks up or crashes, among other things. So we avoid doing certain things. Again, with each passing day more and more bugs appear.

  The PVP(player versus player) system in the game is probably the worst and most pointless of any online only game in existence. This can be especially frustrating for players trying to level on a PVP server. There is supposed to be a system that punishes players from killing other players of a significantly lower level.  This is called ""ganking"". After the first couple of areas on a PVP server you enter areas that are PVP enabled, meaning the other faction can attack you.  Unless you have very high level players with you, you will be ""ganked"" and many times.  Which makes it very hard to level and complete missions in these areas.  After about level 15 you enter the PVP enabled areas.

When you do PVP with players of nearly equal level there is no reward for winning or punishment for losing.  You also do not gain any experience.  It is pointless. The community has been screaming to Blizzard to give PVP meaning. Blizzard was supposed to have a meaningful PVP system in place when the game was released and have promised this ever since the game came out.  But, again, with each passing day, we are told something is coming soon.  We are still waiting.

  All things considered, with the server instability, the bugs and the meaningless PVP system I would suggest waiting to buy the game at this time.  I would wait about 3 to 6 months, check the latest reviews(make sure you read the date the reviews were submitted, don't be fooled by reviews that were written when the game first came out) to see if things have improved.

(Edited August 13, 2006)

As you can see the original review was written over a year ago.  What has happened since then?  If I didn't know better, it almost appears that Blizzard had my concerns at the top of the list for things to address.

The game works almost flawlessly, with only the occasional down time, lags and bugs.  But honestly what MMO doesn't have these problems?  WOW now works as good or better than any MMO.

Some people now say the PVP is the best part of the game and it is something that everyone should give a try, especially the PVP haters, you may be surprised how much you like it.

This game just cannot be excused.

Here are the major problems with this game -

1- The graphics are fair, but chunky, stiff and dated.

2- Gameplay is completely SCRIPTED.

3- Gameplay is clumsy and awkward.

4- Weapons are terribly inaccurate, even from 5 feet away!

5- User Interface is frustrating, switching weapons is too difficult.

6- Story line and voice-acting are pretty lame.

The graphics are not impressive at all, the jungle environment is linited to the paths and directions the designers want you to take...this means you always walk into traps!

You must progress through to your objective, if you don't, the enemies don't stop coming...they are constantly spawned over and over and you'll die! So even though the game teaches you to hide behind cover...you can't because your forced to charge the enemies to make them stop getting spawned...YIKES!

The weapons are terrible. I can stand 5 feet away from an enemy with an M16 or AK-47 and completely miss my target with short bursts to control recoil! Talk about driving you insane!

Then when your in the heat of battle you cannot switch quickly to another wepaon, the guy has to slooooowly holster/shoulder his weapon, then take out the other weapon. By then, your dead!

I am shocked to see the high scores.

This game truly sucks. Lousy single player, and even lousier multiplayer.

Linear game flow, silly and boring story, loose controls, and very boring play make this game a one star. I am glad I sold it and the game guide. Oh, and no co-op either.

The MP was boring, slow-moving, not inspiring...not fun.

If you want fun MP action, with destructable environment, fantastic sound dynamics/realism, and the best looking visuals in a game, head over to Battlefield Bad Company. That has no co-op in SP either, but the MP is great fun.

I would recommend that everyone stop purchasing games with these limitations. The only people hurt by these limitations are the legitimate customers. Pirates will have the games from day one regardless. The game itself has been getting good press which makes me sad because the limiting DRM that it is saddled with will keep me from getting it.

It's not a perfect game, and it's not exactly like the original two, but it's a solid horror shooter with great style, mood and combat. Unfortunately the ""BFG Edition"" is a step back in most ways, worse than the original game on PC.

First off the lighting changes are for the worse. Everything is brighter, but Doom 3 is meant to be dark. The textures look worse under harsh lighting and the mood of each level is thrown off considerably. Even on a gameplay level this matters, since many ammo clips and armor packs were previously hidden in darkness, but now stand right out. The flashlight, long a thing people have complained about needing to switch to, can now be on permanently, but this ruins a lot of the level design and mood of the game. To be blunt: this game and these levels were not meant to be seen under bright lights, and the gameplay is thrown off by the changes as well as the visuals.

Other changes annoy. Quicksaves now pause the action and pop up a menu prompt, which throws off the pace and takes you out of the game. The in game touch screens seem less fluid for some reason, and the PDA is now designed more for a gamepad than a mouse. On top of this the game takes a lot more HDD space, a lot more GPU power and has less ability for tweaking, which will annoy if you want to play it on an older machine or laptop.

The only reason to get this on PC is for the ""lost levels,"" eight additional levels exclusive to this release. The problem here is that Doom 3 and its original expansion are already so long and packed with content you don't really need any more, and these added levels look identical to the main game and play worse, since they aren't as well designed. Just not worth the effort, let alone the money.

I knew the BFG edition wasn't perfect, but I didn't expect it to be worse than playing the original. That makes it worse than a pointless release, it makes it a damaging release.",Worse than Pointless on PC,1386806400,8,{'Platform:': ' PC Online Game Code'},

Yes the new distance attack feature is cool, cities defending themselves is neat, but it's SO SLOW (1.5 minutes per turn?!) and the Workers are SO DUMB!  Instead of building Farms, Mines, and roads, they just SPAM Trade Posts across the continent.  So you're forced to manually fix each plot or end up with a city that is very wealthy but unproductive. Maybe if you could set a function to tell your workers to build or NOT to builder certain things.  For example, I HATE TRADING POSTS.  I typically only build Farms and Mines, allowing the added population to enhance my bottom line through taxation.  Why not have a simple button that says, ""Worker build Farms""  or ""Worker, build Mines""  NO!  INSTEAD all they have is the IDIOT AI that Spams Trading Posts and EVEN destroys Farmland to do it causing city starvation!

Instead of being more complex and interesting than Civ IV it's...childish.  It's like the game wasn't even made for US users, and maybe that's the big secret?

I went on the online Mod forum, I figured, ""Hey, it's been MONTHS.  If users haven't created content, AT LEAST Sid Meir's company will have updated some of the old Mods to play on the new game.""  WRONG.  There are only a few Mods and the ones that are available are often glitchy because Civilization is not a stable platform.  Why is it that Microsoft can create a system like Halo FROM SCRATCH where you can literally make the physics effects blast a WartHog so far up that it can't be seen and not have it affect the game performance, but the makers of Civilization who are on SEQUEL NUMBER FIVE cannot make the game properly and easily modable.  I gave ONE extra star because they have Modability.

Bottom Line, the company has lost their way.  We're living in an Open-Source Sci-Fi world and they're still stuck in History-Teacher mode.  At the very LEAST if they had their own different mods that shipped with the game.  I hate to say it, but Civilization has become like Windows, with each version getting WORSE than the previous one.

UPDATE: After trying to play this to get my money's worth, I've found that even on quick game mode the game becomes unstable after Turn 250!  Tried this with multiple map sizes with graphics set to LOW.  Every time Turn 250 or beyond *crash!*

If you're a CIV Fan please don't buy this waste of money, it's slow, frustrating, and the anger you feel will be more directed at yourself for blowing $60 on a game that more closely resembles work your boss assigned for you to take home than it does any actual fun you'll get from it.

Alright, so the game finally starts for me, and do you know the first.. THE FIRST THING that happens to me? I can't find my ship. I'm on a little island, wandering around. And I don't know what to do. WELL I eventually see this signal flare out in the water.. I swim to it, and its like ""Do you want to spawn back at your ship?"" Uh, yes please!

I also got attacked, on this island, right out of the gate. The same fools that attacked me had also sunk my ship. BEFORE I EVEN managed to figure out anything.

The next thing that happens, is well I got in my ship, FINALLY.. doing it solo.. and it takes me forever, but my first destination is ""Booty Island"" I figure, why not? sounds like a great name! I make it there, I wander around ""Snake island"" because that's what it really should have been called.. I then head over to ""Thieves Haven"" .. I grab a treasure chest, and I head up to.. ""Plunders Outpost"" basically an Island where you turn your stuff in.. A little hub area. I get killed, my loot stolen. And that's garbage.  Complete and utter garbage.

Same old same old, campers camp at a corner and get 30 kills and their team loses because they had no team work,.... I get 3 kills then someone re-spawns behind me and kills me. Ghosts is the only COD that really made me start camping and not doing my objective as much as I used to.
killstreaks: as title says USELESS. Maps are very big and getting heli and other killstreaks like it won't get you that many kills. On the other hand, it is good thing since nobody really cares about getting them; therefore, nobody should camp, RIGHT? WRONG... In every map, there are tons of corners and camping spots for players to camp & snipe. I just don't understand what is the point of camping when killstreaks are useless!!!
Lag is still there: when number of players go above 50000 players, I feel the lag gets worse. When I got the game, everything was fine, pretty much no lag at all. but now,.... it's crazy. Same thing that used to happen in BO II. You shoot the guy nothing happens, he shoots you, die in 3 bullets. Some people see you earlier than you see them. However, I believe it's Sony's server, not the game servers. Because I also experience lag in Killzone and BF4 ( but not as much as COD ).

BIGGEST ISSUE: for some reason IW decided to shove Clans up our asses. I never took gaming that serious to join clans. I just enjoy the game for what it is, and play it for 2-3 hours every day. However, be prepared to be put against crazy good clans because there are certain days of every month that are dedicated to clan wars. What about people who want to play alone? I'm not saying this because I'm not part of a clan ( I have a clan IMOR ), but I'm saying it because I see we go against people who just purchased the game and have no idea what is going on. It will ruin the experience for them, and it is never fun to go against 5 clan members with 3-4 times the skill of a new player. Therefore, be prepared to avoid the game in certain days of every month because you will be against clans of people who prestiged 5-6 times. In the first week of release, I could hardly see 3 people in one clan, but now pretty much 80% of every lobby is part of a clan. Don't get me wrong, clan wars are fun and challenging, but why they are mixed with regular players?? just have them play in a separate lobby.

Over all: this is the list that I recommend for you guys out there, if you just want to buy one FPS multiplayer PS4 game. Here is my list:
1- Battlefield 4( Interesting campaign, crazy good MP )
2- Killzone ( OK campaign, very fun MP)
3- COD ghosts",The game is GARBAGE now,1388793600,11,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
1.0,False,"08 13, 2002",A343DKR8HKOE0K,B00004TSXC,Peter,"Neverwinter Nights is really not a computer game in the traditional sense.  It's more of an electronic version of the pen and paper role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons.  If you are an avid D&D player who can't get your group together at your own house, you now have the internet to do it.  While this is fine for pen and paper D&D groupies, the rest of us are left out in the cold.
Basically, Neverwinter Nights is set up in the hopes that a community will help it grow.  The game comes with a sample campaign to play but it also comes with a complete editor that lets anyone design their own D&D adventures.  Either with the official campaign included in box or some of the community made mods (there are already 500+ available online), you can play Neverwinter Nights by yourself or online with a group of players.  To further enhance the pen and paper D&D experience, there is even a dungeon master client in the game.  If you don't know what a dungeon master is I can already tell you you're purchasing the wrong game.  Basically, a DM watches over the mod and controls the adventure to hopefully provide a better game for the players.  Sort of like an invisible referee.
This all sounds great when reading it on the back of the box but I'm not sure it really works.  For one thing, while the editor has a lot of capabilities, every map has that same square-look to it to fit in the D&D grid system.  Nothing looks natural and after playing a few mods you've seen everything the game has to offer and it all starts to repeat itself.  Also, for a game that relies on the community to invent new adventures, the editor is more difficult than it should be.  If you don't know programming basics, you're going to have a difficult time with the editor as every simple action has to be scripted which is basically simple C+ programming.  To accomodate this new system and catch up with its competitors, Neverwinter Nights also has a new 3-D system that reminds me of hack and slash games like Diablo more than the company's previous classic release Baldur's Gate I and II.  In fact, the official campaign included in the game is NOTHING compared to the Baldur's Gate games and I would recommend that you not buy this game if the official campaign is the only thing you will play.  The included campaign is boring, linear and not that creative, it's more of a sample for the editor rather than an epic adventure.
If you plan on only playing online, be careful if you only have a 56K modem.  You'll never be able to host more than 3 players on your computer without lag.  Also, you'll have a difficult time joining the large servers with 20+ players if your connection is slow.  Neverwinter Nights comes with an ingame browser that divides online games by category.  You can join the action channel, the roleplaying channel, etc.  Most of these games are called persistent worlds and are basically smaller versions of Everquest. While they can be for awhile because of their small size and limited equipment, quests, etc., they never provide much fun.  The best way to play the game is to get together with a group of friends and meet on a weekly basis just like you would the pen and paper D&D.  While you can find people to play with through online fan sites, you'll have a much better time with this game if you already know people that own it and are willing to play the same mod with you at scheduled times.
After trying this game for a month, frankly, I feel cheated.  I bought the game because it promised gamers that even if they didn't want to play online or use the editor they could play the official campaign included in the game by themselves and have just as much fun as they did with the company's other epic releases Baldur's Gate I and II.  That's a misleading claim because the new mechanics of Neverwinter Nights and the boring campaign included are pitiful attempts to live up to the company's previous PC D&D games.  This game is really only for people that want to enjoy an electronic pen and paper version of D&D, the rest of us should move on to Icewind Dale II or Morrowind or hope that another company manages to design a great singleplayer RPG as fantastic as the Baldur's Gate series.",An ambitious experiment in PC gaming but a failure,1029196800,11,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Hoping for a challenge and in an attempt to test my gaming might I purchased a copy to see for myself. The reason that this game is so difficult is not that has puzzles that stretch your mind to the limit or even dynamic enemy creatures to defeat which require skill or dexterity. Dark Souls is an unforgiving torturous game because the creatures not only do ludicrous amounts of damage to the player, but the player does ridiculously low damage to enemy creatures. Imagine a game where a basic common skeleton can kill a player in 3-5 hits, but a player needs to do 6-10 hits to the same skeleton to kill it. Now multiply this skeleton by 6-10 and surround the player with them in a graveyard which is not even that far into the game. If you can imagine the agonizing pain of such a situation, then you have just imagined what it is like to ""play"" Dark Souls. I would not advise purchasing this game unless you want to see yourself flail pointlessly against common enemies and die and die and die, endlessly and with a total lack of enjoyment in your repeated demise.",Total lack of enjoyment in your repeated demise - not a fun challenge,1437264000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1.0,True,"07 21, 2011",A11W4GQ57ZUSWY,B001COVHMS,Longwood Will,"I used this cooler for a while, then found out later that the fans on this attachment were turning off while the xbox was still on.  I would pull the cooler off for about a minute then put back on and the cooler fans would kick back on.

My xbox is on a shelf in an open closet I wired for my home theater.  There is plenty of ventalation, but the backside of the xbox does sit about 5 inches from the wall.  There is plenty of ventalation on the top, sides, and front of the xbox.  So what happens is the cooler was blowing the hot air out the back against the wall.

I found out later that there are two heat sensors on the cooler, one directly where the hot air blows and one internally.  The sensors check the temperature difference and if there is enough difference between the two sensors, then the fans would turn on.  However, if the internal sensor heats up to the same temperature as the outside sensor, then the cooler will turn off.  This causes the xbox to overheat because the xbox fans can't blow out the air well enough with the cooler attachment on.

So my xbox RROD and had to get repaired.  Bad design by Nyko with the sensors, they need to adjust those sensors.  Beware of this cooler if you have the back of the xbox close to a wall (even worse in cabinet).  There is a mod to move the internal sensor to the outside of the cooler case which may help, see youtube, but I tried this and still ran into the same problem but only took longer to occur.

When the cooler works, this does very good, but when the internal sensor overheats then expect your xbox to overheat.

I upgraded the stock internal xbox fan with a aftermarket Talisman Whisper fan, and the xbox runs very cool in my setup.  I highly recommend that Talisman Whisper fan if you are tech savy enough to open up the case.","Beware, fan overheated and caused my xbox to RROD",1311206400,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

So I was taken advantage of by selling the older model for the newer model price and making me pay 109.98 extra for the upgrades. I have no use for the older controller and the old hard drive will not work in anything other than a PS3, so it is useless as well.

I can certainly hear them, because I've been listening to them for the past few years. I will admit, I was excited to play this game at first, seeing as I never played it before Christmas of 2008...but honestly, I wish I had never played it at all. Why? Well, stick around, sit back, shut up and read.

STORY: 2/10
Atrocious. Simply atrocious. You start the game as an ex-SOLDIER named Cloud (default name, seeing as you have the option to name your main character), who is currently an employed gun for a resistance group called AVALANCHE. Why these groups and names have big, capital letters for seemingly no reason is beyond me, seeing as they don't stand for anything. Along the way, you'll meet and greet a number of people who have nothing to do with what you'll be doing in the current area you're in, get pissed off with the inability to comprehend even the slightest bit of dialogue spitting from the mouths of these characters, and finally come to the climax of the game, facing yet ANOTHER completely overrated villain in a battle that will last about thirty minutes...but not because it's hard. It's not. I have so many problems with this game's story...okay, I have a lot of problems with this game PERIOD. You get a total of 9 characters in your party, and guess what? Seven of them have absolutely NOTHING to do with the main storyline whatsoever! The only reason they exist is for party-filling, seeing as they completely blew away any resemblance of a cast and crew of characters that actually mean something to...well, ANYTHING. Two of them you don't even technically have to get in your party to begin with! You can literally beat the entire game--all 13-17 hours of it--with the drooling retards you pick up along the way. The game is so stale and boring in terms of taking your hand and walking you through the story, and everywhere you turn, you can see something you can bitch about for hours. Party members included.

GAMEPLAY: 1/10
Same thing as every other Final Fantasy game released before its time. There's seriously nothing revolutionary about this game. It's the same boring, lazy turn-based system you're used to, except they actually find ways to make it even less enjoyable. The movement of the battles themselves feels and looks glitched, and every time you use an attack, skill, or spell, you'll be sitting there waiting for them to finish with your thumb up your ass. Oh, and if you plan on summoning a powerful magic creature from the Summon materia...well, I certainly hope you stocked up on food, drinks, and toilet paper; you'll be sitting there staring at the atrociously-long summon animations for the next hour and a half before you can even make your next move.

PRESENTATION: 0/10
What are you talking about? This game is CLEARLY not even finished. Do you know how many glitches, bugs, and excruciating errors I found while playing this game? Hundreds. The sickest part? I didn't go out of my way to find them. They came to me. The character models look ridiculous, nobody has anything interesting to say no matter where you are in the game, the battles are boring and unworthy to the franchise's name, and you'll be lucky if you can even make it to the end without exploiting a glitch or two. Or ten. Not only that, but the game is WAY too easy. I literally played through the entire game--story and all--in less than 20 hours. In that time, I never once died or even lost a member of my party (if you're not counting Aeris, seeing as she dies in a cutscene). And hey, if you're having trouble with something, just exploit one of the hundreds of glitches in this game to allow yourself the ability to walk through walls, gain infinite money and items, level your entire party up to 99 in a single fight, deal millions of damage to an enemy with a single hit, or even reset every single in-game switch so you can replay absolutely everything in the game over again with all the stats, items, and equipment you already have. But seriously, who the hell would play through THIS monstrosity anything more than once? This unfinished, broken piece of cow dung is not worth the time.

SOUNDTRACK: 0/10
What soundtrack? It's just a bunch of clicks, screeches, and otherwise infuriating sounds. It's not music. It's a collaboration of anger-inducing noises that will have your TV muted in less than thirty seconds, or your money back! GUARANTEED!

OVERALL RATING: 1/10
This game is even lucky I can give it the rating I did. It's especially lucky that Amazon.com's ability to rate its products only comes in five stars. If it was a standard 1-10 rating, I'd hack my computer to give it less than .5/10, seeing as I can't stand this absolute travesty of a video game. It's a downright abomination to the world, and a big slap to the face of anybody who was seriously into Final Fantasy, like myself. I'm glad I didn't play this game until years after it came out. If I had played it back then, I probably would have been just like all of the other sniveling fanboys and girls and considered it the greatest game of all time. You can't rate a game based on how well it sold, and you can't rate a game depending on the graphics. Why? Because both of those factors are meaningless when it comes to a true review. I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in buying this game should steer WAY clear of it; it is not worth even the effort to post a picture of it here on Amazon.

Kind of cool idea because, after all, you're in space. But it presents a problem. The tutorial says that you can move the camera N,S,E or W by moving the cursor to the screen-edge. But you can't always do that. So there can be action going on just a bit under, over or to the side of you current camera angle and you can't just edge-scroll the camera in that direction. Instead you have to try to rotate the camera one way or the others so that it can center on the action. Meanwhile you can't issue ordes to a specific ship, for example, because you can't select it while you're trying to spin the camera hither, tither and yon. I would rather play Shaq Fu than this.

Now that the power of the SNES can be made into a hand held console, you'd think the GBA version of the original style of MK would rock, right? Wrong.

What the hell have they made here????

A GBA is supposed to be a hand held SNES, yet the SNES game never was as slow as this game, the graphics where not as bad (backgrounds are image's) the moves where executable with ease on the SNES and yet this version it takes 2 or 3 tries to get something to work because the response of the game is not fast enough!!! and the worst thing is the feel of it, you cant beat the computer with ease, everything you do gets blocked, the computer all of a sudden goes on a rampage kicking your butt and you cant do anything about it.

Plus, where the hell is Johnny Cage, Goro but most important of all Raiden??? You cant have a MK game without Raiden.

To screw it up even worse, it's a 2 button game now!!! no more jp,lp,lk,hk,b & r...nope, just k & p... press back+K for a roundhouse kick, press down+back+kick for a sweep... that probably would have been ok to get used to if the bloody response of it actually worked... i have to slow down my button pressing so the computer can execute the moves which sucks to high heaven.

I didn't even get a fatality off, there is no one button fatality code. I played this with a gameshark and needed the infinite health code on. You even need the gameshark to unlock Shoakahn, Montoro and Human Smoke because to access them you have to beat the game then get to use them for one round. WHY THE HELL GO BACKWARDS FROM THE TRILOGY? It's a serious down step and it's the worst Mortal Kombat i've ever played. It even makes me like the 64's version better with it's less characters and no one button fatality cheat that every other version had.

This is the worst MK game ever. Dont buy it, it's slow, it doesn't have the right feel, the response sucks, the computer blocks everything, there is hardly a cheat worth looking at, the backgrounds suck.... there is nothing good to say about this game.

Please, if you do like this game, it's probably because you have never played any of the other MK's before. So, go and find an MK game on any other system and find out why I am saying what I am saying about this version, and you will agree with me 100% when you play the GBA version again and it runs so slow and boring and nothing goes right.",Man this game sucks,1122508800,3,,

I enjoyed Evolution's Motorstorm and Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, so I wanted to check this game out despite the pretty poor reviews. While the graphics are stunning, and the lighting is some of the best I've seen in a game, the driving doesn't feel satisfying at all.

First and foremost, this isn't a sim racer, so I won't judge it as such, but it also doesn't feel enjoyable like arcade racers. It's a mix of a little bit of sim and a little bit of arcade without dedicating itself to either style and it ends up feeling flat and unsatisfying because of that.

Secondly, this game has so many issues with its netcode. I'm shocked that this game still hasn't been fixed yet. I was going to wait longer to buy it in hopes that it would be fixed, but I saw it at Family Video to rent and decided that I'd give it a go, and it's still not fixed.

Lastly, the A.I. is laughably bad and unacceptable for a 2014 racing game. The cars have a path like old racing games, so it never feels like you're racing an intelligent opponent.

Why:
You enjoyed the heck outta DMC 2 and DMC 3, need more of the same, and dig the fashion designs.

Why not:
It's a slow, repetitive, uninspired ""button-masher"" as my friend would say (a game where you triumph not by skillful maneuvers or clever strategy, but by simply punching the attach button allot). The first DMC was a masterpiece of dark, creepy, Gothic horror with heart-pounding action and white-knuckle tension. It was fun to play and cool to watch. It was very empowering.
The second DMC was worthless but the third was somewhat OK. And again, in this fourth one, you just just run around what looks like a European tourist village and shoot/chop seemingly endless legions of monsters that aren't in the least intimidating (rag dolls and marionettes) that just pop up out of the floor until the game decides you've killed enough and lets you continue to the next mindless melee.
DMC 4 has none of the edge of the first and third. It's like it's trying to be it's own game, which is not why we buy it.
The movement is unnatural and the camera is maddening.
The story is uninteresting.
The sound effects are stock.
The objectives are all too often unclear.
It fails to make use of a fraction of the PS3's awesome power. It looks like a PS2 game.

1. Way too futuristic. Wall running and constant, and I mean constant, double/boost jumping is annoying as hell.
2. Limited guns and STUPID special abilities - want a one shot guaranteed noob kill? Then use the 'golden gun' or the even more annoying 'jumping shock' technique - worse than the old panic knife (panic knifing is gone in this game by the way) which was at least fun back in the day as long as you weren't on the receiving end.
3. Worthless Score-streaks. Score-streaks are almost impossible to get anyway since the game encourages constant dying. No matter how good you are, you will die on average every 30 seconds in this game because of so many one shot kill noob special abilities and the BAD HIT DETECTION and people sneaking up behind you.
4. Headsets and Footsteps aren't that helpful - Sound whoring doesn't really help that much unless you are in free for all. I use Astro A40s with the proper settings and I sometimes (50/50 of the time) still don't notice a guy sneaking up behind me when playing team deathmatch or ground war. And that's because friend and foe's footsteps sound alike - I preferred Cod Ghosts footstep detection to this actually.
5. BORING AS HELL. After about 2 matches, I don't feel like playing anymore and turn off my console. The game just is way too repetitive and multiplayer isn't fun.
6. Damn it, there's no trolling - which makes it perfect for little kids under the age of 12. I LOVED trolling with knife, bombs, etc, in previous COD games. Sadly, trolling isn't possible anymore. You can't run around the map knifing guys and getting streaks like in the good old days because of all the jumping and futuristic crap in the game.

The big difference is in the gameplay.  EA was attempting to make the game more realistic.  There's nothing wrong with that as long as you keep the game fun to play.  This is not the case for FIFA 14.  Direction on passing and scoring is a lot harder - it must be related to the physics that EA has added to the player's contact on the ball.  I also feel like there is a slight delay to passing and shooting.  The worst part is when playing single player against the game's AI on World Class difficulty level and up.  The way that they made the game challenging is by dumbing down your players while improving the opposing team's AI and attributes.

1.0,False,"10 4, 2007",A3S2FM1HLD1VQY,B000Q1OTSM,SweetDaddy,"Someone needs to tell S&G Software that it's no longer 1993. Creating games with photographs and video clips in place of digitally created images is about as culturally relevant today as a new Coolio CD, so it's hard to see what the developer was thinking when it made Anacapri: The Dream. This throwback to the era of The 7th Guest may include thousands of photographs of one of the most gorgeous vacation spots on the planet, but it plays more like something you found at a yard sale than a game you pulled down from the new releases shelf.

The line between games and movies is sort of blurred in the structure of the game. While the play style holds tight to the point-and-click adventure template, the game is constructed solely with still photos that give your jaunt the vibe of an indie film. So even though you play a stereotypical sleuth looking to solve the mystery of the ancient Obsidian Disk on the island of Capri, the atmosphere is quite different from the sorts of adventures you might be accustomed to. Thousands of photos depicting everything from seaside vistas to cobblestone roads, to the many quaint shops lining the narrow streets of the titular town of Anacapri, give you the impression that you've embarked on a real trip to the exotic Mediterranean locale. The gameworld is absolutely massive, so it frequently feels as if you're really exploring all of the crooks and crannies of the island.

However, there are prices to pay for this type of presentation and the sheer size of everything. Many of the most potentially picturesque outdoor shots are blurry or strewn with artifacts, presumably to keep picture size reasonable. Oddly, the most sharply detailed pics are the dull ones that show a shopkeeper behind his counter or an old man sitting on a bench. Regardless of quality, there is an air of absurdity to the whole affair because of the use of multiple shots of people during conversations to give the illusion of movement. Done more subtly, this might have been a good idea, and might have nicely added the illusion of movement to what is otherwise a breathless game. But all of the changed poses and expressions given to Anacapri residents are wildly exaggerated, so encounters with them come off like some sort of bizarre mime show. Finally, there are some technological issues in the install process due to the high number of photographs. There are so many photos included as single, high-resolution files that the installation takes almost as long as a flight to Capri itself. You might want to brew a pot of coffee for this one, as it takes a good two hours for all seven gigs of picture files to be transferred from the DVD to your hard drive.

Unfortunately, this time isn't well spent. The game amounts to little more than a great selection of somebody else's vacation snaps. Gameplay lacks structure, due largely to the sheer size of the island. The game itself is such an afterthought that it feels like something hacked together at the last minute to justify writing off a vacation to Capri. Although you're assisted by a hotspot system that highlights key locations on each photograph, it's ridiculously easy to get lost because the entire island is open at the start of the game. Make a wrong turn, or simply get befuddled over the game's many vague clues, and you're soon off on an unintentional sightseeing tour. Although it's relatively easy to work your way through most in-game situations by doing some careful pixel hunting, closely following all of your instructions, and continually checking the city and island maps to see where you are, you still need a walkthrough to figure out how to get where you need to go.

Adding to the confusion of Anacapri is a plot that values nonsense about the nature of reality over the virtues of an easy-to-follow narrative. As if the real-world island wasn't hard enough to figure out, you regularly have to chug dream syrup that sends you off to explore surreal lands populated by ghosts and mythological monsters. Set-piece puzzles that bypass the absurdities of the plot are the only strength here, and there aren't nearly enough of them to compensate for the awfulness of everything else. Most don't even show up until near the end of the game, such as the nifty series of sphinx riddles, and the tile puzzle that is one of the final barriers to the Obsidian Disk.

Horrific voice acting and scripting, along with some truly weird musical choices, sprinkle extra strangeness into everything. Strangers stop to talk as if they were long-lost friends, and the topics of conversation often seem nonsensical until you start looking back on things and putting together the big picture. All of the characters in the game are voiced by a handful of terrible actors making lame attempts to change their voices with bad accents, which makes even real-world interactions with people shimmer like hallucinations. The dialogue is universally overwrought, characterized by lines such as ""That disk will remain a dark stain on our past and humanity forever,"" spoken with all of the passion of a fast-food counter jockey asking if you want to supersize your value meal. Music is frequently jarring, and bounces all over the place between poppy lounge music and driving guitar. It's like you're being stalked by somebody with a xylophone on wheels and Yngwie Malmsteen, respectively. Thankfully, there are frequent, long stretches of silence.

If it were a relic from the early 90s, Anacapri: The Dream might be worth a play for the nostalgia factor alone. A ""so bad it's good"" vibe also creeps into the adventure through the voice acting, almost giving you the feeling that you're reliving some fond memory that hasn't aged particularly well. But you're not, and considering that the longing for a bygone day is the only possible reason for playing this backward game, you'll soon get tired of flipping through photographs and move on to something more modern and more competently designed.",Someone needs to tell S&G Software that it's no longer 1993,1191456000,13,,

1.0,False,"04 5, 2011",A33DZPE5V6FCR4,B0047THYWC,Schwe1nehund,"PROS:
- Voice-overs: excellent voice-acting, especially Hawke, who is one smooth cat.

- Script: Bioware's dialogue and writing is still among the best in the industry (script does not make the story).

- Skills: The revamped skill trees add a lot more diversity to your chosen class (rogue, mage, warrior).

CONS:
- RPG mechanics: practically non-existent or not in sync with established norms. A perfect example is how a dual-wielding rogue dishes out more damage than a double-handed axe-wielding warrior (huh?).

- Story: non-existent 'main story.' Its actually a hodge-podge of side quests - most of which are so ill-structured that one has to wonder how they had the balls to charge $59.99. The quest structure is too simplified and like the rest of the game, utterly boring. And then there are the filler quests. All of them have you stumble upon a random item (e.g. someone's hat) and turn it into a random, characterless person (e.g. a monk) with nothing more than a 'this looks like it belongs to you.' Ridiculous. Had this game come out for a mobile device or an ipad, it would have been great (but also, not on my radar). Angry Birds on my Android provides much better entertainment than this stinking mess.

- World: The biggest disappointment is the use of the same areas ad nauseum ad infinitum. I practically quit playing the game for more than a week after entering the Wounded Coast for what felt like the 100th time. This is shameful when considering the fact that it took me about 70 hours over a period of 10 days to finish the original game.

NEUTRAL:
- Combat: Its fun at first, but glaringly different from Origins. I did like the old system better. This one's just got too much blood everywhere - and the most shameless use of repeated death animations ever. Hit someone with a mighty blow and the dude/dudette explodes in a shower of gibblets. What's more, females undergo a sex-change in the instant before death and land in a heap of distnictly male body parts. Yes Bioware, I can spot that bald head and those bulging forearms.

- Music: Not bad, but not particularly memorable. A few recycled tracks from the first game - which both hurts and benefits the game. Truly neutral on this point.

OTHER THOUGHTS:
Accoridng to Steam I have spent a total of 364 hours on Origins and another 30-something on Awakening. Rest assured that'll never happen with DA2. Providing actual entertainment was clearly the lowest item on the developer's priority list. Where Origins was a work of love and a proper homage to the Baldur's Gate series, DA2 is simply the result of EA pressing Bioware for a quick profit. DA2 is to Origins what Justin Bieber is to Pink Floyd. I'm not buying anything from Bioware that's got Mike Laidlaw at the helm (Sorry to single you out Mike, but if this ship's going down I'm holding the captain responsible).

The voice acting is something out of a bad B flick porno flick, down to the random missing timings: people talk over each other. The story is, meh. And the game play and controls are without polish. The model animations are randomly OK or horrible (notice the first scene where people keep falling, how everyone falls the same and their hands are floating off the ground).

They attempted context sensitive controls... attempted. It either over shoots, gives you the text as if you can perform an action, but you can't (for example, holding a sword prevents you from picking up items, but it says you can - lack of polish).

Overlooking all the graphics and voice issues, I gave the game a chance based on it's gameplay. The controls were impossible. Not over complex, just, again (word of the day), unpolished. Easy, fixable issues were overlooked, and are now ingrained as standard (I mention this as not to imply they will ever fix them; they will not, they are now expected). For example, you attack/action the direction your character is facing, not the direction you are pushing on your control stick. So, in the middle of combat, you find yourself hitting enemies several times, you attempt to dodge out of the way, but you dodge at them, even though you are pushing away from them. Again, actions are based on your characters direction - this is a defect, contrary to how these types of games traditionally play.

There is no jump button, and trust me, you want to jump a lot. So it takes the road of Mega Man, big deal...? Still, I attempted to overlook these minor issues, but the fighting is so bad, I found nothing redeeming about this game.

Unfortunately, I had played a lot of other games so there was nothing to really try but Diablo 3. I had heard a lot of tall tales going around about people making big money off the RMAH (real money auction house) so I figured why not give it a try.

After a week of playing and getting to Inferno act 2... I can safely say this is one of the weirdest products foisted on the gaming community that I've ever seen. I say product, because D3 is more product than game. You surely know how casinos glitz up their slots and their decor to create constant stimulation...  Well, Diablo 3 is more like a casino than a videogame. The spell effects are big and over the top, the graphics dramatic and colorful. There's stimulation constantly. However there's no game.

Strategy-wise you don't really do anything. Either you have the appropriate gear and items to fight or you've run up against a wall and need to buy something extra in the auction house. This can be done with gold you earn playing the game... BUT... not when it matters.

The final run of the game is called Inferno. At this point you'll need millions of gold per gear piece by Act 2 or simply die in the game. And remember, as I said there's no strategy either way. Either you've bought enough gear, or you die. They were even thoughtful enough to add huge fees for dying in Inferno, to truly lock you in to using the auction house.

Now to make matters even worse for the poor soul playing the game normally, they added a real money auction house. Using this brilliant feature you can buy items for up to $250 to help you beat a game you already beat 3 times. Make sense? It shouldn't. The ""money for nothing"" greed surrounding this is reminiscent of the web craze called bitcoins. To clarify, everyone loses here except for the house and the early adopters. Because I started the game last week, I doubt I'll ever make more than a few dollars here and there on the auction house versus the thousands some have already made. And as the pyramid scheme gets less and less believable by the people willing to hold up the bottom, the whole thing will be utterly worthless. In short, the game currently resembles a money making scheme of the shadiest type more than a game.

It really makes me wonder what Blizzard is doing in the gaming business. I mean they are casino developers. That's a fact, they just do it in the virtual space.

As game developers they lack any concern whatsoever for the elements of the RPG experience. The storytelling is Saturday morning quality, which is being generous. Cartoons usually have themes and some plot development. This game does not; it just has the silly voice acting of cartoons.

This game lacks any attention to gameplay details. It's impossible to think of any fresh tactics to try playing this game, because you can't do any with the controls and design of it. You can whack away at the monster. You can use one of the few build selections that work at level 60. That's it, the rest is 99.9% stats. Anyone who says all ARPG or dungeon crawlers are this simple is crazy. It's the norm for there to be layers of options to your play choices in any game. This game doesn't have any layers because they want you to focus on buying the items and that's it.

So there you go. You have been warned, and probably chastised by many for even thinking about buying this game. But the choice is yours. If you do get it though, give some love to developers of games that care. Check out Guild Wars 2 or some indie games.

They put that StarForce antipiracy crap on the disk. Many computers really get screwed up by it too!!!

I actually kind of like the style of strategy and squad play found in BIA. I really prefer the style of COD but this game was actually fun. I just think this game falls short of what it could have been. That is one reason why I rate it only 1 star

Here is what I really do not like at all about this game and why I gave it 1 star.

1 - You get some level load freeze ups that will happen even on a fast system.

2 - ANNOYING, LONG and POORLY voice-acted cutscenes and storyline that you CANNOT skip past! Ughhhhhhhhhhh...the stupid, dramatic puss spews out for minutes on end and you just get so sick of it after the first few chapters you feel like muting the volume until it is over!!!!  And I do hit my mute button! It is that bad and that boring!

3- Nothing new since the original came out. Basically, Ubisoft wants to rip you off for $50 more. I say it is flat out greed this time. If you played the original, your going to feel cheated. If you haven't...save some bucks and buy that in the discount rack!

UBISOFT has really become a huge disappointment to many gamers over the past 2 years. They were rolling along nicely. However, it seems like they have just stopped trying to work hard to provide an interesting product. They have resigned themselves to pumping out subpar games hoping you won't read reviews like this one.",Exactly the same as the first version,1131753600,37,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
1.0,False,"11 30, 2013",A2OFBKHA6C6BUK,B00C7103C0,Shawn Bird,"All three games in the Arkham series have done a good job at being Metroidvania type action adventure games. The same efforts were put forth with Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate, and although on some level it succeeds in that, the game as a whole falls short. The map structure is confusing, the mission objectives bounces all over the place, and the story is an utter bore.

Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate is a sequel to Batman: Arkham Origins (which itself is a prequel) set a couple months afterwards. You start out chasing after Catwoman from rooftop to rooftop and once you catch up to her, the police come, and Batman dips out just in time for them to catch her. The story then picks up two weeks later at Blackgate Prison, where it seems a riot has taken place and the inmates are now free to do as they please, very much like how it was done in the first game, Arkham Asylum. The story from there is thin and easily forgettable with recycled villains and constant backtracking. And thanks to the erratic missions structure, keeping focused on it is a chore in itself.

Blackgate is separated into three main areas all of which are under the control of a different Batman nemesis. They are the Joker, the Penguin, and Black Mask. All of which of course build a small army of enemy fodder for the Caped Crusader to pummel his way through. As the Dark Knight fights his way through Blackgate, he finds everything he needs with the help of Catwoman because apparently this great detective, with all his cool futuristic gadgets, needs her to tell him where everything is and what everyone is doing. This is more than likely due to the map being nothing more than a hinderance, and the inconsistent mission structure.

You can choose which of the three major sections you would like to start in, but that choice seems useless, as you will be jumping every which way over the three due to the objectives in no time, causing tons of backtracking. It is not bad to force players to backtrack, but it has to be done in a fluid way. Blackgate will have you enter a new area and after a few steps inside, the game will stop you and tell you that you can not go any further until you go back to a place you were already at and get something there to continue on. So you will take three steps back almost every time you want to take two steps forward. This makes the game feel much more repetitive and grind-y than it needs to be. On top of that, the map at times will makes you think you need to go one way and you end up going in the opposite direction. It makes checking the map constantly a must, and causes a big headache along the way.

Blackgate presents everything the same as the major console titles, it just does it in a 2.5D viewpoint instead of third person. Even with this change, the combat still holds up decently, seeing it is the same attacking and countering as its console counterparts. However, Blackgate does suffer some with the combat being that it is a side-scroller and the fighting quite often takes place on two planes, the foreground and background. You do not have the choice on which of these you are going fight on as Batman just starts beating on whichever baddie is closest to him. This is fine when starting out since you're fighting every opponent with hand-to-hand combat. But it becomes more difficult when groups of enemies have a variety of weapons and abilities. You can easily find yourself stunning one enemy and then attacking a different one on another plane completely by accident on numerous occasions, leading to absolute frustration

Outside of the normal bad guys, and of course the three main villains, there is also some mid-boss fights in the game such as Bronze Tiger and Solomon Grundy. These encounters stick to a pretty regular pattern of attacks. You have to defend yourself and then attack, and mix between that and, once in awhile, stun them with your cape so that you can attack them afterward. The big three boss fights are more puzzle-oriented however. These fights can have strict conditions that are needed to be met in order to be successful and will result in serious repercussions if you fail. They take some trial and error, which would be fine if it wasn't for the almost instant deaths from one mistake. If that wasn't bad enough you restart a room or two before the boss fight when you continue. You could easily end up taking more time to get back to the boss fight than being in the fight, until you know exactly what you need to do to beat them.

Blackgate is full of hidden passages, dangerous obstacles, and encrypted security panels for Batman to wonder through when hes not crushing the skulls of every prisoner in Blackgate. Of course there is Detective mode, which you turn on and off by tapping the Vitas screen, revealing an X-ray-like representation of your surrounding from the other games. You can also hold your finger on the Vitas screen for a few seconds to open up a small circle on the screen that will stay there and move with your finger, as long as you continue to hold it on the screen. This is useful for finding hidden objects that weren't immediately recognized in detective mode, and its also a pretty neat little addition to the game that can not be done on the major console titles.

Blackgate has everything needed to be just as good as its console counterparts, but along the line it stumbles, and doesnt match up with its console brethren. Maybe it was rushed or not given the time and effort that Batman: Arkham Origins was, and put out as just the handheld counterpart. Blackgate is a great looking game, and the combat is fun for awhile, but the story is thin and mundane, and that is what should have gotten the most attention. Seeing as the gameplay is almost a carbon-copy of the other games, one would think that took the least amount of effort, and so that would have given more time to build a story. Unfortunately that is not what happened here. It also doesnt help forcing players to jump here and there with backtracking for almost every little thing at every turn. It would be nice to see another try at a Batman game on the Vita, as the handheld sure could use more games. I just think that after the Arkham series, which has seen four titles five years, he may indeed be the hero the Vita deserves, but not the one it needs right now.",My Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate Review,1385769600,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
1.0,True,"10 19, 2015",A1XHJLOT7KJP9O,B00XUZBCDQ,jnutz24,"Let me start by saying I have been a NHL series supporter from the very beginning. I am and have been severely let down by the past 2 iterations of this game. NHL16 brings back a bunch of the game modes that were missing from NHL15 but changes made to particularly EASHL has made them feel bland and boring. Online play has been spotty at best, input lag and overall game lag continues to plague online play.

HUT, which is a favorite of many, building your ultimate team to only realize no matter how good your team is build, how fast your forwards skate, the defense can and will skate faster than you backward and still break up most scoring attempts. This is the year of the one timers and cross crease passes. Pass interception % and shot block % seem unreasonably high this year. Offline against superstar CPU is very frustrating and difficult. CPU never misses a pass, shots are almost always on net and the stick lift and poke check are ridiculously over powered. Try the same stick lift against the CPU, and you'll be spending time in the sin bin. I have played over 50 games offline and I have yet to have more than 1 PP per game. During that same time, CPU enjoys at least 4-5 each game for similar game play. Puck physics are worse this year, if your 'bumped' from behind skating full speed the puck will almost always stop and be picked up by the defender. I've also seen pucks that appear to be bouncy balls, bouncing down the center of the ice. Slap shots from the point that are blocked don't always bounce off a defender as they would in RL but they stick instead. Player complaints of not receiving daily check in rewards have been ongoing since launch and EA states they are still trying to locate the issue. Random disconnects (I'm hardwired on FIOS) and failure to retrieve data messages are becoming more and more frequent.

CPU AI is not realistic, makes you almost wonder if the people producing this game even watch hockey. Before you say it I know they do, it just feels they don't think things through. CPU defenders seem to know or react to your moves before you make them making it difficult for you to shake them. Checking feels worse this year, big hits are still in the game but sometimes when you try to check it feels like there is a force field around the player being hit that doesn't allow you to make contact. Your player seems to just follow the target until they skate away. AI defenders on your team seem to back off plays and even skate away at times. Its frustrating beyond belief and hopefully be fixed by tuner or patch. Unfortunately to date EA has failed to produce any significant improvement with tuners, and at times making it much worse.

On-Ice trainer is a nice feature for beginners but I believe the time developing fluff like this should of been spent on game play where this game lacks the most. Fantasy draft is back in GM mode which is always a good time. The morale system is cool in the beginning but becomes tedious into later years of your franchise. Skip to shift is back in Be a Pro which is a godsend but still don't understand how that wasn't in last years version. The point distribution for actual on ice actions is a very nice addition.

I cannot recommend you spend the full $60 bucks on this game in the condition it sits today as I write this. Don't waste your money on the premium edition either, the gold packs are 12 cards with 1 rare. On average I get 3 players and rest consumables. More times than not I get a rare consumable not rare player. Rare doesn't really mean rare either. If EA gets its act together and fix the most blaring gamplay issues Ill edit this post and change this rating. Until then we can only hope EA feels/listens to all of the valid complaints and provided the team at EA Canada the resources to correct the online issues as well as the game play problems that continue to plague this series.

I like and still play Call of Duty I and II. The first of the Modern Warfare series (3 so far) does not go as far as the second in this series that I find an insult to the military personnel of the United States. But there is a lot of frustration involved if you have ever served in the armed forces. The single player campaign game I found started out well enough. You were constantly following the same objective, get to the terrorist group and eliminate them. The ending, however, is less than desirable.

The tunnel vision game play is a major flaw. There is no real use of terrain, cover, concealment and movement. There is no chance of flanking the enemy at any point. The worst part is that if any event happens, the control of your player is gone and suddenly you no longer know how to stand up. Every time, you have to wait for someone else, who was also hit by the explosion or whatever, but THEY managed to get up. If you crash in a helicopter, you lie on the ground until the sergeant picks you up. If a bomb goes off and your all on the ground, you wait until the sergeant gets up. (Or Lieutenant) There are way too many of these staged events. You are also funneled through the game, obligated to follow the narrow path from one spot to another. The ONLY way to stop the flow of constant enemy forces is to take a physical location. They never run out of people. It is a narrow path, developed by narrow minded programmers I guess.

I find it mildly playable in the single player game.

1.0,False,"12 11, 2009",A1G337CKP447FX,B0016C3260,Dwayne J,"Why do people like Valkyria Chronicles? I really don't understand it. There's nothing innovative about the game, and the non-innovative things aren't very well-executed either. Quite frankly, I don't think there's anything good about this game.

GRAPHICS AND ART STYLE

The graphics are very technically well done. As someone who has dabbled in computer graphics, I know how difficult real-time non-photorealistic rendering.

And yet, all this fine technology is wasted on the bland, unimaginative art style of Valkyria Chronicles. The character designs? Repetitive and monotonous. The tanks? Plain and boring. The landscapes? What landscapes? (Seriously.)

MUSIC AND VOICE ACTIING

The music sucks. None of the tunes are particularly catchy. None of the battle music gets my blood going. None of the cinematic music gets to me. The only memorable song in the game is the Title theme. And that's only because I hear it every time I turn on the game. Also, whoever thought it was a good idea to do the your turn your music, my turn my music thing should be fired and blacklisted from working in any job in any creative industry.

And the English voice acting is horrible. Now, I generally have a pretty high tolerance for bad voice acting. I mean, I've seen a lot of dubbed anime, and I didn't mind the English voices. To insist on the original Japanese voices is a rarity for me. But the English voice acting in this game was so bad that I went and changed the voice-overs to Japanese. That's how bad it was.

STORYLINE

Utterly boring. Now, in general, I have nothing against long cutscenes. But only as long as those cutscenes are interesting and relevant. Valkyria Chronicle's cutscenes were so boring, I'm pretty sure you could cut 45 minutes for every hour of cutscenes, and not only would the story be more entertaining, but you'd still have a coherent story with a beginning, middle, end, and fully developed plot (if it could be called that). At least the writers had good sense to make some of the cutscenes optional. With one notable exception (which had NOTHING to do with the plot), they were the most boring cutscenes of all.

Now some of you might cite character development as a reason why the cutscenes are so long and uneventful. Well, I'm sorry, but having one character constantly talk about his love of nature for a few hours while another talks about how she loves baking bread hardly counts as character development. (No, more like filler.)

Others of you might claim that the long and uneventful cutscenes were an attempts to show what kind of emotional trials the characters are going through. Except they failed to realize that emotional scenes (which, to be honest, weren't very emotional) about characters that the audience doesn't give a flying fish about will merely bore the audience to death. The writers assumed that we cared about the characters. It doesn't work like that. You need to give us a reason to care about these characters, THEN show us the emotional trials of those characters.

And the plot twists. The plot twists were all so predictable. With one notable exception (which also had nothing to do with the plot), every plot twist in the game was heavily foreshadowed. As a result, when the shocking plot tiwst happened, they had little (if any) impact. That and, shocking plot twists generally aren't a very good form of storytelling. (Consider M Night Shyamalan.)

GAMEPLAY

Now, the meat of the review. The hype mill has been telling people how innovative Valkyria Chronicles is and how well designed the game mechanics are. What game mechanics? Everything Valkyria Chronicles offers either has already been done to death by other Strategy RPGs or adds nothing to the game or is just poorly executed.

The battles aren't strategic at all. When building your squad, there's no customization and no variety. Instead of using strategy to fight your battles, either it's a simple case of shoot anything that moves or it's a case of trying to figure out which hoops the game wants you to jump through in order to clear the mission. Not only that, but the gameplay is grossly unbalanced. The only reason why some of these battles are even winnable is because the player goes first and because the opponent AI is an idiot. Seriously, I've been in multiple situations where the computer opponent has the game in the bag, but instead of winning, they either retreat for no reason or they charge straight at my tank and/or shocktroopers and get themselves killed.

And to make up for this horrible horrible AI, the game designers decided to let the computer opponent cheat. Basically, they get access to much better stuff than the player, they get to start with much more material on the board and better board position, and they get an unending supply of reinforcements.

Not only that, but how could they claim to be a strategy game when something as simple as looking at the board is so obfuscated. The overhead map is all but useless. If you really want to navigate the battlefield, you'll have to use the mini-map in 3rd person mode instead (which often, but not always, contains better information than the overhead map). So you inevitably end up wasting the first few actions trying to figure out what exactly is going on on the battlefield. (Which doesn't matter anyway, since on the ""hard"" missions, you'll end up restarting a few times while figuring out what hoops the game wants you to jump through.) Some people will say that this is to give the game a bit of realism, since you rarely have complete battlefield information. Well, there's already a tried-and-true gameplay mechanic that simulates this. (And it's even named after the actual military term for imperfect battlefield information.) It's called Fog of War. If you're gonna re-invent the wheel, at least make sure it rolls.

Other people will claim that these crappy maps help immerse the player in the role of the commanding officer, where they make decisions based on sketchy maps. And then the game goes ahead and breaks the immersion by allowing you to zoom into 3rd-person views of any particular soldier anywhere on the map. (And I'm not even gonna mention the whole ""Book Mode"" fiasco.)

And every now and then, the game will insta-kill you for no real reason, which makes the game frustratingly unforgiving. Sometimes, it's because you made just the slightest mistake. (Like you positioned your tank slightly off center so that an enemy lancer could make a lucky shot from halfway across the map and blow up your tank, causing you to instantly fail the mission. And by Murphy's Law, if it can happen, it will.) Others, it's not because of any mistake you make, but rather because the game never told you that the enemy can do that. (Like when the enemy's armored train that is equipped with a powerful machine gun that can shoot you from halfway across the map is ALSO equipped with a heavy anti-tank cannon, which insta-kills your tank, causing you to instantly fail the mission.) And sometimes, it's because the game is just plain unbalanced. (Like when the enemy has an anti-tank cannon that can kill your tank in 3 hits, and in this mission, the developers decided to code the enemy to shoot your tank with it 3 times in a row even though normally the AI is dumb enough to NOT do that, causing you to instantly fail the mission.) Fortunately, being able to save during battle mitigates this problem, but that also opens up a completely different set of exploits.

The game also puts undue weight on clearing missions quickly, so much so that even fans of the game will tell you that speed is more important than tactics. A STRATEGY game where SPEED is more important than TACTICS. Yeah, sure whatever. And sure, the game will also reward you for blowing up enemy tanks and killing enemy leaders, but the reward for speed-clearing is orders of magnitude higher, and it drops off so quickly that even being a couple of turns too slow will make that reward disappear.

Valkyria Chronicles is so NOT a Strategy RPG that even the game describes itself as an ""active simulation RPG"" instead of a Strategy RPG. And by that, they mean it's a turn-based 3rd-person shooter with minor RPG elements.

Beyond the lack of strategy, the game also has serious pacing issues. During battle, it takes a long time for anything to happen. (Punctuated by the fact that the game will often interrupt these slow battles with INSTANT GAME OVERS.) Outside of battle, even though the game takes about 40 hours to complete, the game is so boringly slow that it seems like a short game. (And yet, this gamer was glad it was finally over, because it was just SO AWFULLY BAD.) For some reason, the designers thought it was a good idea to have only 1 battle per chapter, even though some battles are obviously related in the story. (Example: The ""Prologue"", and the first two chapters, which really should have been part of the prologue.) This results in most chapters being completely undeveloped, despite hours and hours of (uneventful) cutscenes, as well as way too few battles in the game for you to have a real game. And then, for no apparent reason, the designers break the 1 battle per chapter rule several times over the course of the game.

Basically, everything the back of the box promised was a lie. ""Elaborate strategic maneuvers""? More like SCOUT RUSH!!! ""Action-packed real-time combat""? More like slow, uneventful combat where the player and the computer opponent take turns moving soldiers one at a time. ""Epic storyline filled with dramatic warfare""? More like long and drawn out storyline filled with repetitive pea-shooters. ""Customize your platoon with 50 characters""? Really, each and every one of these characters is a near perfect clone of one of five different archetypes.

CONCLUSION

Why do people like Valkyria Chronicles? The stunningly beautiful graphics engine is wasted on the unimaginative art style. The music is horrible. The storyline bores me to tears. And the gameplay is frustrating, unbalanced, poorly executed, and just plain not fun.

You know what I think happened? The developers had a nice non-photorealistic rendering engine, and they wanted to build a game around it. They heard people liked RPGs, but they also heard that RPGs had already been done to death. So they sat in a room for a few hours and quickly came up with a few concepts, then whipped up a game as fast as they could, and didn't bother polishing it at all. Then, in order to get the game to sell like hotcakes, they paid game reviewers to rave about this game and hype it up to get people to buy it.

And the PS3 owners, frustrated that all the good RPGs went over to the Xbox 360, decided to buy Valkyria Chronicles and convinced themselves that it was actually good. And half of these people don't know what a ""Strategy RPG"" is, so they think Valkyria Chronicles is actually innovative. And a lot of these people are secretly Shooter fans, and since Valkyria Chronicles has guns, hurray for them!

And THAT is why people like Valkyria Chronicles.

Couldnt wait to get off work so i could go play.  put the game in and actually sit through the tutorials.  Lets say i was very impressed with gameplay and how fluent it worked.... remember i am only in the tutorial.  After i finished tutorial i went to the saga.  Now being someone that owned all budokai's i was expecting a decent length and substancial storyline.  To say the least i was wrong.  I finished the story that night.  I mean what a rip i only got up to the cell saga?  I came in thinking it was all the way through to buu at least and had all the characters i came to love in budokai tenkaichi 3, seeing as that only makes sense.  What really bothers me is after each saga they fabricate a movie based on gameplay to wrapup what happened.  I think this space and time could have been better put into including a buu saga.  I mean most people just skip these low budget in game movies anyway, so why not give us something we want.  When i buy a game i buy it for substance some good gameplay.  Not half of a game with better graphics.  Btw they include the first disk of season one ......  Season one came out over a year ago and most of us fans already bought it.  Why give out something we already own.  Even worse why give out part of a season where you will still have to go out and buy the whole thing if you don't own it.  I mean seriousl what are we going to do with one out of six disks in a set.  Just a way to get ppl to sink more money into this franchise.  I strongly urge everyone to rent this game before buying so you can see exactly what its worth.  This game to me is WAS worthless and i am ashamed that they would even sell this game in the market let alone sell it for such a steep price.  Trust me you are better off getting something else.

Cons
1.  Game is short only through the cell saga.
2.  Game has cutscenes every 5 seconds during actual fighting which throw you offguard and confuse you.
3.  Maps are incredibly small.  you can successfully hit someone about 2-3 times before you hit a wall.
4.  Gamplay has no learning curve its ez to play with no skill involved
5.  YOU HAVE UNLIMITED SPECIALS with little to no delay before refire. tisk tisk
6.  Limited characters maybe 13 or so.
7.  Transformations make you weaker......why why would they do that.
8.  Game is 100% completed in one night.

10. When you near the end you hope the game finishes soon because it is soo bady.

Wow, people come to the forest to capture animals... Whoopee... For some reason, you are tasked with finding film reels (which has absolutely NOTHING to do with the plot BTW). So, let's get to the Pro's and Cons, shall we?

Pro's: None, this game has kicked the bucket.

Cons: 1) The game is so linear, you will scoff and sneer at the sheer lack of things to do. 2) The story, is stupid and lame, something a baby could think up, or do better with. 3) Graphics- Let's get one thing clear: I realize that this happens to be one of the Gamecube's release titles, but just look at Luigi's Mansion! That's a classic and amazing game! The graphics are superb, perfection! This game... ugh, just ugh. I'd rather watch Shrek. 4) Gameplay- Like I just said, there is a lack of things to do. 5) Sound- The jungle beats for the game get old fast. Also, Rosie O'Donnell voices Terk; need I say more?
All in all, this game is an example of something that should have never happened. The only games that are worse than this game are: E.T. on the Atari 2600, (Google it, young-uns, I'm a teenager and I own one. You can make the effort too. :3) and Tomb Raider Underworld on the PS2 (I love ya, Lara, but that game should have been canceled on that console). If you are looking for an experience, a masterpiece of a game, then here are some suggestions: Ico (PS2: it's worth buying one just for this game), any Tomb Raider title (especially if you love action/adventure games), the Zelda series (because if you don't play them, you have no right to say you know classic video games), Pong (yes, Pong is better than this game), or any Mario title (if I have to tell you who he is, you're not allowed to play games at all).

I hadn't even bothered to touch this since Madden 2012 and I thought maybe after 5 years things had improved.  WRONG.

Pros - You get to play a football game, but it could be so much better

Cons...

1.  Tiresome overly complicated menus.  EA wasted more time and energy on bogus presentation and complicated menus than they did on actual game play and real game improvements.  Play calling is horrendous now with the menus they have.

2.  Redundant pathetic coaching reactions to EVERY play get so tiresome, it takes that much longer to play the game.  I see Jim Caldwell on my screen more than my actual players and I really could care less what he thinks.

3.  Poor tackling and horrible physics.  It's sad that a game like NFL 2K (and I hate bringing this game up) is far superior at 10 years old and EA is still lagging behind and hasn't figured it out yet.  Guys look like they are drowning out there when they flop around.  Ridiculous passes and catches that are something out of a Matrix movie.

4.  Pathetic defending.  Played a guy online who couldn't move the ball against me except for his standard hail mary to Larry Fitzgerald to catch the ball in double and triple coverage, no matter what defense was selected.  Scored both his TDs this way with the epic ""aggressive catch"".  I'd really love to know how receivers in the NFL actually decide which catch they make isn't aggressive.  This was an absolute joke of an idea.

5.  Excessive fumbling.  You can breathe on a player and he'll cough the ball up after you're putting together a solid drive.

1.0,False,"02 11, 2012",A3DGCNADDUMFUL,B001CMIUYS,ZeeZee,"I've been playing games for over 25 years, and I'm a big fan of virtually all genres.  Console RPGs in particular have been a staple of mine since I played the first Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest) and Final Fantasy games back on the NES.  Now, after subjecting myself to the first 25-30 hours of this game, I have to wonder...

Did they even bother to play test this game?

This has to be one of the most disappointing gaming experiences of my life.  It's an absolutely unforgivable game in almost every respect aside from its technical achievements.  The greatest problem with this game is that it's simply not fun to play.

For every hour of playing this game, I felt that the designers were punishing me for continuing to try to stick it out.  And it's not even so much the linearity that I find to be such a problem (I actually don't mind linearity so much), it's the fact that the whole sum of the first two disks could have been condensed into about half of the time it takes to play them.  You'll be spending so much time fighting in endless battles that artificially extend the length of the game.  If you try to ignore the battles, then the designers punish you even further with an unbalanced and stupid levelling system that forces you to continue to grind.  It's a total grind-fest at its core.

The battle system is terribly tedious.  Even when you have the battle mechanics down to a science, it's constantly all about the broken stagger mechanism.  E.g.  Cast spell after spell until the stagger meter hits its limit, then attack full-force and juggle your opponent to death.  Repeat this 20,000 times until your mind is completely numb.  There is no balance to this game.  It is totally broken and makes me yearn for the days when Square actually took care to make this franchise excellent when its creator was still with the company.

Back to levelling up.  The system is pointless because for the first 20 hours of the game, you're stuck with levelling up the characters in a way that the game tells you to do it.  It might as well automatically develop character spells and stats the way old-school RPGs have always done it.  It's just another way to waste your time with having to manually go through and apply your points to stats (which is also slow).  Hold down a button and wait for 5 seconds while your points deplete and link the next skill.  Repeat this 20,000 times.  After the first 20 hours, it lets you have more flexibility by learning any skills for any of the characters, but what's the point?  It penalises you even more if you do this.  And the game is brutal if you don't have the right team combo anyway.  The battle with a character with wings (I won't spoil it by saying his name) about 20-25 hours in rings a bell.  I fought it a few times and it was tedious.  Tried again with a different set of characters and beat him in less than a minute and 30 seconds.  What's odd is that was one of the only battles I actually liked.  It required some actual planning and thought to properly abuse his stagger gauge without forcing him to morph into total cheapness.  Finishing the battle (especially in 1:30) is really rewarding, because it lets you appreciate the game in a greater capacity if only they could have put more effort into the tactics side of things.

Which brings us to one more issue...  The auto-battle system.  I actually don't mind this system since it *should* let you focus on strategy in greater depth.  But it just feels broken somehow, and you'll be spending all of your time shifting between defensive and offensive ""paradigms"" (an absolutely idiotic name) since a lot of enemies are deliberately overpowered in a flawed attempt to keep the game interesting.

I'm all for trying new things in games, but if this were not called ""Final Fantasy"" then I am certain that the reviews would be even lower than what you find here.  It feels too experimental and broken.  There are many other games that have done a better job with the tactics-oriented play.

It all feels like a broken, but prettier version of Last Remnant.  Which, by the way is a better game , but only marginally so.  It's better in the sense that it is more playable and has a better story, because LR was a technical disaster (made playable by installing it on the hard drive).

Final Fantasy on the other hand is technically amazing...  At least graphically.  It's one of the prettiest games I've seen in years, even on the technically ""inferior"" XBox 360 version.  It makes me wonder why they needed any of the absurd FMV.  Get with the program, Square.  This is not 1997 and Final Fantasy 7.  There is no need anymore for *any* FMV on today's consoles.  They could have fit the whole game and its multitude of palette swaps, hours of dialogue, on a single DVD.  It's the FMV that requires disk swaps every 10 hours.

The graphics are not without flaws.  When you finally get out into open areas (I think after the first disk and again at disk 3), the game comes to a crawl.  You'll understand that the graphics are only good because you've been jammed into tight corridors with short draw distances, with artificially large backgrounds that try to give the illusion of open space.  The level design is misguided, and areas take hours to get through.  You'll love the beautiful scenery for the first hour until you are so sick of running down the same type of corridor for 5 continuous hours.  You'll finally be cast into faux-wide-open-spaces that look dull and run at about 5 frames per second. And yet again you'll have to fight hours upon hours of forced battles in order to survive in the next area.  Yeah...  This time it lets you skip this area entirely, but punishes you in the next area if you skip the grind.

The music is a bore-fest.  For such a high-budget game, you would think that they would at least put some work on this.  Tracks are uninspired and sometimes are interesting, but as a whole they are pretty terrible for a game of this calibre.  I find it so amazing that the industry music veterans are have left these big companies and work on smaller games.  E.g.  Uematsu working on the Mistwalker games (founded by the creator of Final Fantasy - By the way, all Mistwalker games put this crap to shame).  Or Mitsuda composing for ImageEpoch (Arc Rise Fantasia was a great traditional RPG game, if you can get past some of its localisation problems).  Even low-budged RPGs from Square, like Nier (which I loved), have top-tier soundtracks that best anything else out there.  There is simply no excuse for how bad this game's soundtrack is.  It's not the worst I've heard, but it doesn't live up to the franchise by any stretch of the imagination.

As for the story...  It's okay, but nothing to write home about.  You can determine the outcome from the get-go.  There are minor plot-twists throughout but it's nothing that isn't predictable.  The writing is amateur, at best.  As many others have mentioned, the game is littered with jibberish nonsensical terms that only make any sense if you read the game's built-in dictionary (which in some respects is more interesting than actually *playing* the game).  If they had actually bothered to *tell* the story, then they could have cut down some of the grind-fest in favor of good storytelling.  But it's like they deliberately tried to never require that you actually have to read something.  As far as I can recall, virtually all of the dialogue in the game is spoken.  In the past, I think I had wished that many games were like this and now I am seeing why it is a bad idea for both technical and game progression reasons.  Towns don't exist so you don't have to *read* any dialogue...  Ever.  You barely even have to read during battle.  It's like an RPG for 4-year-olds.

The cast of characters is laughable and most are annoying.  Most of the dialogue is overly dramatic and poorly written.  A times, it's campy but not done intentionally. The voice cast is generally pretty good, with the exception of Vanille, who you will make you want to poke out your eyes with that terribly conceived Anglo-Australian squeaky accent.  You can't even understand what she says half the time because they make her talk just to talk, and the dialogue during non-cinema sessions (e.g. when the just randomly talk while you run down a corridor) is generally unintelligible because someone didn't know how to properly mix the audio in the game.

The save system is obnoxious.  It encourages you to save a new file every time you hit a save point.  After about 50 save files, the hard-drive access starts to crawl.  After 80, it's even worse.  After 99, it forces you to start overwriting your old files...  The only problem with this is that you have to hold your right d-pad for 5 minutes to get all the way back to the first file.  Again...  Who play tested this?  It's downright moronic.  After a while, I just purged all except for my first 10 save slots.  Even that took 10 minutes because the XBox memory manager makes you select and confirm each file deletion, one file at a time.

It's like every dollar and hour of development was dumped into the game engine, CGI, advertising, and hours of voice acting, but nothing else.  Congraduation (sic) Square!  You've officially turned one of your biggest franchises into a tech demo.  This is what Square has become since FF VII.

These problems, are among the many reasons why I stopped playing this franchise after FF VIII (which was also highly overrated, but was at least somewhat more enjoyable than this garbage). I made a terrible mistake by trying to get back into the franchise with this game, and now they've turned me off for at least another decade.  I seldom buy Square games anymore, and if I do it's for the Enix side of things (a disastrous merger if I do say so myself, which only benefited a failing Square but tainted Enix forever).

If you want to buy a good RPG out there, there are dozens upon dozens of them.  This is not one of them.  Try any of the Namco Tales games, something from Tri-Ace (like Resonance of Fate.  Even Infinite Undiscovery was way better than FF XIII), Tri-Crescendo's Eternal Sonata (which is a few years old, cliche, but still decent), ImageEpoch's RPGS (Arc Rise Fantasia), Mistwalker's games (Lost Odyssey is great even though it's a few years old now), or even Nier (hated by many, but one that I couldn't put down).  But, honestly, stay away from this game.  Only diehard fans can stick it out, and I'd wager that most of them finally got off the bandwagon after experiencing this game.

I spent $15 on this game, with a gift card that I didn't even pay for, and still feel totally ripped-off.  I think it's because I wasted 30 hours of my life playing this game, just hoping that it would get better.  I just can't do it anymore.  Even if the ending is excellent, I'm done playing this game.  It's evil in disguise.  I can't waste any more of my life on this miserable game because there have been no rewards.  At some points, it actually feels like it's starting to get great.  It even gets fun.  Then it punishes you AGAIN and AGAIN for continuing to play it.  I'm done with this.  I actually want to literally throw this game in the trash because I hate it so much.  I have *NEVER* hated a game as much as this.

Ugh.  And yet I've wasted yet another hour writing this review.  I could go on and on and on for hours about the problems with this game.  There is nothing good about it.  Avoid it at all costs.

There are plenty games out there that take place during real battles and campaigns of World War Two, but here we have a ""What If"" scenario. What if Winston Churchill didn't survive a fateful car accident that he had while visiting New York in 1931?

The folks at Codemasters seem to think that the Third Reich, after conquering Europe would launch an invasion of the United State eastern sea border in 1953.

This game took only seven hours to play, and I whish I had those seven ours back. It's as the Angry Video Game Nerd saids, ""a TISH load of KUCF."" The game feels like it was rush out with chucks of content cut out becomes they didn't meet the ridiculously short deadline.

You control a New York construction worker Dan Carson who seems to know how to use German weapons, knows something about hand to hand combat, and how to wire bombs, this is never explained. Like Master Chief and the Marine in ""Doom"" you are fighting this invasion single handedly, your NPC resistance fighters and national guard soldiers are killed within five minutes of their introduction, at least they provide you with ammo for American weapons because it doesn't show up anywhere else.

The controls are hideously stiff, making movement and aiming abysmally slow and even jerky, it's like trying to move around underwater. The graphics are not as sharp or as detail as they could be (yes I know this game came out in ought six, but Half-Life 2 came out the pervious year and that game is still beautiful today).

The game is also plagued with various video bugs that are never fixed, unlike other games that routinely update their games; Codemasters has no update patches for Turning Point. There seem to be jump cuts in the video when you reach a draw point, there would be about a two second freeze then a wall or a door would appear right in your face and a nazi would spawn right behind you and club you to death. The only ragdoll physics is when you kill some one, the fall to the floor or onto a table and then freeze with their arms and legs at ridicules angels. There's also lousy hit detection.

This is a massive shame because on the surface it's a great idea of a game. Alterative World War Two. But Codemasters doesn't take advantage of the game's setting and there doesn't seem to be to many history buffs over at the Codemaster office.

What about the Japanese? Won't we've still gone to war with the Japs in 1941?  And developed the atomic bomb? Maybe Carson is a veteran of the War with Japan.

No mention of Japan is every made. In fact there is no back round information about what is going on aside from the death of Churchill. The player doesn't know that after conquering the British Isle in 1940 the Reich goes on to conquer Russia and most of northern Africa and the Middle East, giving German access to lots of oil, that they trade to Japan, allowing Japan to conquer the rest of Asia and making the US's trade embargoes against Japan redundant, thus no Pear Harbor attack, no War with Japan, thus no war with Germany. And no nukes for the US.

And why shouldnt it? Diablo 2 was a great game and still manages to hook players in for being more than 10 years old which is a testament to how good it was.

Diablo 3, however, was a letdown and failure in every possible way, and a slap in the face to fans who have been waiting so long for the third installment.

First problem, was of course the launch. Blizzard knew they had a massive amount of people preordering the game. Beta and stress tests were run, so theres no excuse for what happened when the game went live. Servers crashed, and people trying to log in were essentially blocked from playing a game they paid for. The online only play method proved to be a horrible idea that only punished customers and became apparent the first day. Instead of preparing for the launch and overcompensating for the huge demand, Blizzard chose to go the bare minimum route to see just how few servers they could get away with to run the game. It took about a week for the log in issues to be resolved, but even after that, the people that could finally log in were greeted with horrible server lag and pings that were in the 250-700 range which meant huge delays with what was happening on screen, and even more trouble for people who attempted to play hardcore mode. The game would freeze up for a few seconds, and you would find your character permanently dead after the server re-synced.

To this day the game is still unoptimized and people with higher end systems are still experiencing bugs such as the infamous stuttering problem which was present from the beta and never fixed even though Blizzard said it would be for the release.

Blizzard famously adopted the ""it will be released when its finished"" viewpoint on the game. However, seems they didn't stick with that for long since the game was released unfinished, buggy, and missing many features, biggest of all being arena combat and PVP. It was rushed to market to appease stockholders and report financial gains plain and simple.

The graphics are a mixed bag. On one side, they don't look terrible and the effects look nice. On the other, the atmosphere is not Diablo at all. Instead of a dark and dreary world, they chose to make it colorful and cartoonish to an extent to mirror World of Warcraft.

Gameplay wise, the game was somewhat fun, but only on the first playthrough. Combat and skills work nicely together, yet when you finish the game on normal mode, theres not much more reason to play. The game just gets a little bit harder on the next difficulty, but the story and quests remain exactly the same.

Acts 1 and 2 were somewhat interesting and varied. However, Act 3, and to a higher extent Act 4, seem very rushed and bland. The storyline for the game was also pretty boring and uninspired and you can tell the people that did the original games had nothing to do with this one.

Inferno mode which is the highest difficulty, just turns into grinding mobs to farm high end gear. The drops in Diablo 3 have become extremely rare to get anything good, which means you need to go to the auction house to get halfway decent items. However, this makes the game just feel like pay to win which essentially it is with the addition of the real money auction house. The auction house has also made gold practically worthless. Botters and farmers have driven prices in the auction house to insane levels where it costs 500 million gold or more for decent items, and the value of gold is dropping daily. Blizzard even patched the game to make equipment repairs cost more money so you're constantly fixing your gear and not making any money to buy anything.

For $60, there just isn't any value in this game. Its no longer a Diablo game, and I guess that should have been clear since most of the team that made the first two games have left Blizzard. If it didn't have Diablo in the title and was named something else, it wouldnt have sold anywhere as well as it did. They should have just named this World of Warcraft: Heroes or something like that because its exactly what this game is. A WoW spinoff and cash-in attempt by Blizzard to exploit their fans for money.

Where Persona 3 and 4 managed to raise the bar for the series after the long stretch of downtime from Revelations Persona and Persona 2 Innocent Sin/Eternal Punishment, Persona 5 does nothing to raise the bar for the series. It offers a cast of characters that is very much crafted around the same old tired tried and dry tropes and cliches of anime, manga, and video games of the 90s and 2000s. Now in the 2010s you'd think ATLUS would've walked away from that and done something to revolutionize the series.

The problems with this game don't end there. This series continues to boast too much dungeon crawling with this entry. At least it follows in Persona 4's footsteps of making the dungeons more interesting than Persona 3's recolored blocks for a 250+ floor tower (Tartarus). However it's still a flaw that needed to be brought up. Oh and the turn based combat is also a problem. It's 2017 ATLUS not 1997, if Square's Final Fantasy can move away from it why can't your Persona series?

The story/plot, is actually quite a step backwards. Whoever thought it'd be a good idea to make us play as anti heroes/pseudo villains needs some serious help. And the way this story ends is about a hundred times more upsetting than the canon ending for Persona 3. It's an ending that leaves me feeling like nothing was actually resolved or accomplished over the course of the game.

I hate the look of this game. It looks like Eternal Sonata meets film noir. This is a game made for the PS3 released onto the PS4 without taking advantage of any of the hardware's capabilities in the next generation console. It gives the game a dated feel all around which coupled with the gameplay and characters only makes the game look a hundred times worse.

The music for this game is forgettable and bland IMHO. The most standout track is the returning incarnation of the Velvet Room theme first used in Persona 3 way back in 2005-2006. I also have a huge issue with the Velvet Room itself. The fact it's a prison isn't my issue oddly enough (though I could do with less bondage sex slave imagery and overtones). I don't like Caroline and Justine at all, and Igor has been downright destroyed since Persona 4. Where Igor has always been creepy, he's never felt less welcoming than he does in this game.

A closing complaint as I'm going to go crack this game in half and throw it out my window as soon as I'm done with this review; I don't appreciate how I'm surrounded by a bunch of jerks for NPCs and supporting cast members. From Sakura-san to Kawakami-san to random school students I can eavesdrop on everybody's a prick. I play video games specifically RPGs to escape such people not to deal with more of them. If I wanted to deal with jerks I'd just live my real life not the life of this god forsaken protagonist.

Can't believe they had the nerve to charge more then $5 for this from the get go.  Even the $10 I paid, almost a year later, that others suggested waiting for, is pushing it, IMO.  Not sure I'll ever trust the MGS developers with my money again, as this game can only be either someone's idea of a bad joke or the result of some inside bet on what they can get away with in the current game market of developers releasing games that have either been significantly compromised to meed their own unnecessary deadline or worse, released untested to the point that it's virtually unfinished.

There's a raging debate on the net between fans of simulation racers like the Forza series versus arcade racers such as the excellent PGR series (or more recently Driver San-Francisco). I'm only going to rate this game on four factors which are important to me :-

#1. Sheer fun value.
#2. Visuals / Graphics engine.
#3. Crash / Physics engine.
#4. Pacing / Thrill / Driving on the edge-of-your-seat value.

For those 4 categories Forza Horizon achieves a 1 out of 5 IMHO!

GRAPHICS
I find it hard to believe the ex-Project Gotham Racing guys were involved with this game as it feels immature predating PGR3 / PGR4 by quite a margin. First off, the graphics do not feel current or next generation. Driver San Francisco destroys this game graphically! BTW: Driver-SF is flawed in its own way (see my review), but graphically its far superior. Whereas the Horizon physics engine feels incomplete even quite basic. Crash into a car head-on and the visual results are well... pathetic! A lot of other reviews have talked about the stupid in game gimmicks so I won't be redundant here, except to say the only thing I liked in this game was the in-car view.

SHEER THRILL
I primarily want to do a comparison between the more fun racing aspects of Driver-SF and PGR3 & PGR4. I play Forza 3 and Forza 4, and I'll openly admit that I'm not a huge fan of either, however, they both vastly surpass this effort. Forza 3 & 4 are closer to real-world racing for instance the FIA GT3 supercar series. But the fun value isn't there for me. I think video games should be slightly exaggerated and therefore the cars should have looser handling to capture the sheer thrill of racing! That's why I rate PGR and Driver-SF above the Forza series as the former are more fun IMHO.

OPEN-WORLD
Regarding open-world sandbox driving games, again Driver-SF kills this game stone-dead! Driver-SF is hugely ambitious and the game delivers a viable open-world. But Horizon doesn't feel like an open-world at all, it feels more like a Need-For-Speed imitation, albeit with better graphics perhaps!

ITALY / FRANCE
Overall the Driving genre desperately needs to be reinvented on the Xbox as its becoming staid. For instance, why are there no racing games based around Italian or French towns anymore...? Bring back and update the excellent handbrake racer 'GTI Club'.

IMDB: RONIN (1998)
I want a nail-biting racing game that feels as real as the DeNiro car chase in the 1998 movie 'Ronin'. The Forza series is not a patch on Driver-SF or PGR for that IMHO, but hey they're selling a ton of product so what do I know!",Skip!,1366848000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

""I cannot begin to tell you how excited I was for this game and how utterly devastated I am at the final result!!!!!

There are no cutscenes, no beginning, no emotional attachment to the characters or environment!!! If you don't watch Kingsglaive you have no clue what is going on.

The story is non-existent and in a final fantasy game that is unacceptable and unheard off. Final fantasy lives and breathes the plot and story firstly so for me this was not a final fantasy game.

Also, I cannot believe how much was cut from the original versus game!! The scenes with Noctis at the beginning coming down the stairs to fight the imperial troops with the sword shield and climbing the building to kill the troops was the cornerstone of the game and so emotional it was the best thing I had ever seen and I fully expected to see this in the final game! Why would you cut all the cutscenes out of the game and put them in a movie?? This is utterly pointless as the game becomes a hollow shell with just a massive expansive open world to explore.

 Also, the leviathan fight was NOTHING like the original trailers and was totally simplified and looked crap! Shamefully, SE had multiple story driven CGI game trailers they released to the public AND NONE OF THESE SCENES APPEAR IN THE GAME! This is misleading and can lead to legal action against the company for misrepresentation of the final product such as the same kind of result as watch dogs or Destiny.

One thing I cannot believe is that in the in game menu there isn't even a bestiary or story index which blows my mind? How can you have a final fantasy game without these things?

Also magic is so poor, ONLY FIRE, ICE AND LIGHTNING??? WTF??? Come on what about Ultima, Holy, tornado, meteor, cure/cura/curaga, shell, protect, regen, bio, stone, break, flare etc!!!!

Also the summons are so few and incongruous; the point of a summon in final fantasy is to have control and give your all to summon the aid of a god not have to run round a map and wait to see if they will show up and only in specific areas! Also they won't show up in an epic boss battle but will for a run of the mill fight on the world map, this doesn't seem right. You cannot level them up either which was the main part of having them to get stronger and learn new powers etc. Also you obtain Bahamut and Ifrit but cannot use them?? Bahamut only shows up in a boss fight this is so wrong!!!

There are only 4 party members and you can never control the other three and they have such a lack of party customisation. You cannot even programme the party on the basics of their actions like fight, protect, use items/magic etc.

I could go on and on as I am so upset with this game! Final Fantasy is a living breathing entity which is based on these fundamentals which cannot be changed otherwise the end product ISN'T a final fantasy game but becomes something else with a final fantasy sticker slapped on the side of it. True fans of the original series will never accept anything less than this!!!!!

I only hope and pray that SE do the final fantasy 7 remake justice - The STORY is the most important part of that game and it NEEDS CGI cutscenes to link emotion and story telling the same was as the original. If they focus primarily on combat etc like FF15 the whole project will be a flop!!!. That remake is for the FANS NOT NEWCOMERS.

Bottom line - DONT CHANGE A WINNING FORMULA AND BETRAY THE MILLIONS OF ORIGINAL FANS WHO HAVE PLAYED FF FOR 20 YEARS AND SPIT IN THEIR FACES!!!!

It's really not that good compared to what else is available, and the improved graphics and audio are the very least one should expect from a next gen console game. The fact that there's nothing new here is particularly frustrating. I think the WWII experience peaked about 6 years ago, with certain of Steven Speilbergs productions. We can never repay the greatest generation, and making stale video games meant to approximate what those people saw and did is the very height of cynicism. The only thing that could trivialize the horror of WWII more than this game is probably some kind of sugar cereal.

-Extremely linear gameplay

-Worthless multiplayer

-Annoying AI

-Highly contrived hand to hand combat scenes that literally resort to button mashing

-Unclear objectives

-Very little control over what equipment you can use (basically you should steal the first German MP40 you can get your hands on for ammo purposes).

-Unclear reasons for dying(often).

I enjoyed the PX22 at first. This was my first (of three) PX22 models. I'll admit I could have taken much better care with my first one. But this one seemed to last an efficient amount of time, and I didn't experience many problems with it. One night, I fell asleep with this plugged into my tablet, and during the night it fell only a few feet to the floor. The male audio jack connected into the tablet had bent during the fall. (No worries..yet). I explained my accident to Turtle Beach and they were very helpful with the return of my product. I was then shipped a replacement product very quickly and without any hassle. This is where my liking for it (and TB in general) starts to crash. I was paying an extreme amount of attention to everything with this new model, from placing the headset down gently and plugging the jack in nice and softly. But this thing was determined to break on me, so my replacement broke after normal wear-and-tear, after only a mere four days. The audio amplifier box had completely stopped working, for whatever reason. TB had claimed I could get as many returns as I'd need with my active warranty. This is when I had to hold their hand through the entire return process, and they'd get mixed up every single time I had to email them about the return. (I needed to contact them through social media..Twice). They were not very unhelpful with the return of my second headset, and they even said my return had not arrived at their warehouse. I sent them proof, and luckily they cooperated from that point and I was shipped a new headset. This is now my third pair and I plan on selling it. I would look elsewhere if you're looking into PS4 headsets. Hope I could help by addressing my problems

Loving flying games so much, I always find value on games that most casual gamers dislike. There was very little to appreciate in this game. I'm going to start out by listing the positives.
*Short Campaign (This is a POSITIVE?! Yes.)
*Single Player Achievements are easy

Like a sucker, I actually pre-ordered this game (360) when it came out maybe six months ago. I am writing a review for it so late after I purchased the game because when the game came out it was virtually unplayable. The game would FREEZE in single player. Allllllll the time. I put the disk in last week, there was an update, and the game no longer froze, so I figured it would be a good time to beat it and get it over with.

The patch fixed the straight up freezing, BUT there are still a ton of bugs. Over the past few days:
*When flying to an objective, the ground/buildings disappeared, and I flew around until my plane exploded.
*After dying once, I respawned with only 1 missile. I would fire it, wait for a long time for it to reload, fire again.
*Game started lagging (single player) on several missions, audio disappeared

Multiplayer:
Doesn't exist. Yes, the game supports it, and yes there are tons of achievements for multiplayer, but I've never found anyone online when trying to play it. If you are trying to get these achievements, hit me up, and maybe we can test out this multiplayer.

Gameplay:
The biggest mistake was playing the first half of the missions on ""Easy"". I switched to ""Hard"" and noticed virtually no difference in difficulty level. Play this game on hard, get all the achievements at once.

The gameplay is horrible in that planes fly in straight lines and spam missiles. Good luck trying to stall the airplane. Even on ""Hard"", there is a minimum airspeed. You can hold the break and fly 90* straight up, the plane will not stall. Flight physics are non-existant. Planes don't really behave differently. They look different, act about the same.

Missions are repetitive and easy. Throw on some long range AA missiles, shoot down all aircraft from long range, switch to long range AG missiles and take out all ground targets from so far away they cannot hit you. This game really isn't worth getting into much, nothing remarkable.

Should you buy this game? YES!!!!! If:
1) You already have all other flight games for xbox, and beat the crap out of IL2, Birds of Prey, Blazing Angles, Ace Combats, etc.

Plainly put, there's never enough ammo in Halo 4.  A large majority of my time is spent constantly scrounging after every skirmish for rounds, and that's just to use any weapon, not just the one I currently have.  I can't fight with the arms I desire and always have to switch every few minutes (if I'm lucky).  There've been occasions I've had to restart checkpoints because both of my guns ran dry in the middle of a fight and I had nothing but melee attacking.  This is an FPS whose sole focus is on shooting things; it's not Deus Ex where the gunplay compliments the whole package.  In Halo, gunplay IS the package.  Running out of ammo should not even be a possibility unless one is making a point of being wasteful.  I once picked up a Needler only to find that it had a whopping 17 rounds of ammunition in it.  SEVENTEEN.  Hell, why not just make it five?  I killed one Elite and was forced to find a replacement.  Once I found a shotgun with 12.  What is the point???

I just can't play this game.....it is not fun due solely to this issue.  Ammo consumption/distribution is incredibly imbalanced as the amount of rounds one must use to kill an enemy is disproportionate to the amount of ammo the game affords the player.  Perhaps 343 wanted to force the people to try out all the weapons instead of the ones they like but this is not the way to do it.  I've searched around the net and see this is a fairly common complaint (even in multiplayer) so I know it's not just me.  This problem was also present in Reach but not nearly so pronounced.  Here it's absurd.  Playable?  Yes.  Fun?  No way.  It's a damn shame too as if I were able to fight without always having to scan the ground near corpses afterwards for useable weapons Halo 4 would be an enjoyable game.  As it is now, it's imbalanced to the point of frustration and tedium and my copy has quickly found its way onto ebay.

The only thing I kept thinking while playing 4 was, ""I want to be playing CE"".  I did so and it felt like restraints had been removed.

Actually, I've never really had a keyboard fail at typing before, period...in fact, I'm currently typing this edit to this review on an old dell keyboard from 2001...lol.

Original Review:

A solid mechanical keyboard. Keys are plastic, but it's nice to have the aluminum base. Makes it feel a little classier.

Doesn't use any software. All the programming is done via the keys on the board itself. I think that confuses people, as it's unusual to not use software for that type of thing, but it's important to point out, so people don't think there's something wrong with the board.

I don't really care about programming the lighting. I don't look at my keyboard while gaming, so lighting up specific keys seems pointless, but it doesn't hurt, I suppose.

It comes with additional ""game-friendly"" keycaps for WASD and 1-6. I only use the ""W"" one. ""A"" and ""D"" especially, due to their contouring, are horrible for actual typing, and who's got the time to be switching back and forth. Even the ""W"" one does little, probably, but it also doesn't interfere with my typing, so I use it. Plus, it looks great:) That said, I would LOVE to see all the keys have the same texture as those extra contoured keycaps had. That, to me, is the best thing about them, and an entire keyboard with textured keys would be AMAZING.

If you don't know how to take the caps off, you use the tool that comes with the board. They're like tweezers. Insert, pull straight up. There will be a little resistance, which can scare you if you aren't sure you're doing it right, but you are. Doing it right.

One minor odd thing I found with my keys are that some of them bleed a little bit of light out through streaks on their sides (usually the side facing me). Not all. Just some. Like they hadn't been painted completely black. Again, very minor.

Overall, purchased it here for $119.99. Slightly more expensive than the ballpark for non-RBG ""gaming"" mechanical keyboards (though I also choose the brown switches, the other switches are cheaper and smack dab in the same pricing as its competitors). The aluminum base was worth it, as well as not having to deal with extra gimmicky ""macro"" buttons.

Compared to Corsair's Strafe (non-RGB model), I'd choose the K70, due to multiple different switches, aluminum base (Strafe is all plastic), and dedicated media buttons. The only direct comparison would be if you use red switches, and there's only a $10 difference there, which I think the build quality of the K70 is worth.",Terrible reliability.

Its a joke and its time, its finally time for EA to stop making football games and give up their license so other makers (2K) can make a better more true to the game experience. This game hasn't improved since the 2005 season and the new improvements are down right garbage. For one the new ""physics"" engine and I use that term very loosely because I have no idea who was in charge of this part of the game or why on earth they didn't finish the engine before the game came out. Players run into the backs of their teammates and fall down and play is blown dead. Collisions are down right comical in how the players fall and how physics plays all but zero part of how the system works, and speaking of comical after plays players will be falling all over the place and running into everyone like crash test dummy's. Pathetic. Franchise mode is gone.. Never mind, no point talking about and mentioning how every time you sign in they ask you to take a survey so they can see how bad they messed up but the survey never pulls up and gives you an error message and won't let you take it.. Its bad guys but for football fans this could be the best thing to ever happen to NFL gaming because now that EA has clearly given up someone else can step up and finally turn this game into a next gen game and not just some random piece of trash that shows no effort, heart, of detail.

1.0,True,"03 3, 2012",A331U01T7DMMHP,B003G2Z4FK,Davidovich53,"This controller worked great - at first.  Now it keeps turning itself off every 2 seconds.  It's been rendered unusable.  And before anyone asks, no I didn't drop it, throw it, slam it, get it wet, or expose it to harsh conditions.

I'm now forced to go back to the default Sony controller, which is what I was trying to get away from in the first place.  The Nyko controller worked fine for about six months, and now it's ""bricked"" itself.  I know this controller was an aftermarket, ""budget"" product, but was I wrong to expect more from a manufacturer in the year 2012?

My original review is as follows:
The primary features on this controller are the L2/R2 buttons which give you just enough resistance to feel ""right"" when being pressed.  And they're in a concave shape (like the 360's controller) which prevent your fingers from accidentally slipping off.  If you're anything like me, you probably can't stand the mushy, imprecise, slippage-prone L2 and R2 buttons of the default Sony controller.

The ""rightness"" also applies to the face buttons and select/start buttons, which feel springy and deliver a nice popping feel, giving good feedback with every press.  The body of the controller itself is ever so slightly bigger than Sony's, which allows for a more comfortable, natural-feeling grip.

However, the L1 and R1 buttons by contrast feel flimsy.  The R1 button in particular has a tendency to get stuck in the ""pressed"" position, which actually does NOT affect performance: even when the button is stuck, my onscreen character doesn't actually fire his gun.  When I actually tap the button (in its stuck position), the added pressure on the button actually makes my guy fire.  This took a little time to get used to, but now I hardly notice it.

Clicking the thumbsticks (the L3 and R3 functions) takes a lot more effort than on Sony's controller; you have to really, REALLY press hard to make them click.  After using the thumbsticks for a few days, though, it's become somewhat easier.  Same with the D-pad; you have to press down hard for the movement to register.  Tilting the sticks to move my character/pan the camera also takes some adjustment; in testing out this controller on Saints Row 3, I had to turn my camera sensitivity way down because it was simply too fast.  Most games allow you to adjust camera sensitivity, so this isn't too big of an issue.

The fact this controller is wired may be a negative to some, but for me it's a positive because I don't have to keep buying batteries.  Another big drawback is that you can't use the ""home"" button on the controller to turn on your PS3; you have to hit the physical power button on your PS3, then hit the home button on the controller to sync it to the system.  Yes, you have to do this EVERY time you turn on your PS3.  It's a very minor step, but if your couch is very far away from your PS3, this could get annoying.  The controller has a nine-foot cable, with a Velcro strap to keep the cable rolled up if you don't need the entire nine feet (and let's face it, who would actually need all NINE feet?).

Perhaps the biggest drawback is that this controller does NOT have SixAxis controls.  You read that right: if you want to play Heavy Rain or Flower, break out the default controller.

I hope this review is useful (if a bit long!), with both the pros and the cons.  Overall I'm very happy with this controller, especially for only 13 dollars, as what was only supposed to be a second controller has now become my primary one.","Updated review, 11/9/12",1330732800,7,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},

1.0,False,"04 11, 2009",A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001GGO1GG,Caleb Williams,"Words really can't express just how disappointed I was in this game. The trailers for it, made it seem just as good as the first, if not better with its innovative ""Don's View."" The first game drew a lot of controversy and attention due to the fact that it contained voice acting from the legendary Marlon Brando and other actors from the movie. It also apparently had people who were involved in the movie as consultants towards the atmosphere and the mafia underworld of 1930s New York in the video game. ""The Godfather"" game had a lot going for it in terms of scenic detail, texture, atmosphere, story and structure. It was worked on for a very long time and a lot of effort went into it. It had a lot going for it and it will certainly be remembered as a classic game; but sadly, its sequel will not.

""The Godfather II"" has literally, in one glance, managed to destroy any credibility built up by the first computer game incarnation. There were a lot of great ideas for this game and if more time and money was put into the game, there's no doubting this could have had the possibility to be one of the best games of the year. The flaws seemed almost endless when playing and after an hour or two, I became so frustrated by the awful playing experience, I would have preferred to go to work.

So what flaws am I talking about here? Is the game really as bad as I'm trying to make out, or am I just being a bit melodramatic? Well no, I'm not being melodramatic as this is sincerely the worst game I've played this year. The most advertised aspect of this new game was the introduction of the revolutionary ""Don's View."" This gave you the ability to take on the role of Don and overlook your empire by sending your men to attack rival family rackets or help out your businesses that are under attack, without you becoming directly involved. In this view it also allows you to manage other aspects like family finances and soldier upgrades.

This is about the only redeeming aspect of this game, and even this is annoyingly awkward and seems to have just been thrown together at the last minute. The controls in this game are clumsy, ill thought out and even at times seem unresponsive. The graphics and atmosphere are the biggest let down of the entire game. The original managed to capture the 1930s New York atmosphere perfectly and presented sincere graphical intelligence with the rendering of the movie characters faces and voices. I'll give the sequel credit, and they did manage to get Robert Duvall to do the voice for his long stuck character, Tom Hagen. That is the only credit I'm giving this game as thinking about the graphics and scenery, I remember just one of the reasons why I hate this game.

Remember when I said about the first game capturing the atmosphere perfectly? Well, EA threw all that out the window with this. The premise of setting the game in 3 prime locations (Cuba, Florida & New York) was a brilliant one and upon first hearing about it, I became excited at just how they're going to present the individual atmospheres in their own unique way. No. That wasn't going to happen. What EA did do, however, was give us a tiny New York map, and a slightly bigger Florida map and I haven't managed to get to Cuba as I became so frustrated by it I just don't want to play it. About the only thing unique about the two locations I have seen is the base appearance as any aesthetic individual depth seems to have been cast out at the planning stages.

The controls are also shoddy and annoying. For a game that boasts about its incredible handling in the terms of its interrogation system etc. The entire thing is just frustrating. I appreciate how they incorporated the motion sensor controls to this, but they became utterly pointless and annoying as the slightest movement by me would place the man I had hold of in a completely unwanted position, and with no option to turn it off, that annoyed me more. The fact that I have to keep re-adjusting the camera is also something I don't want to have to be thinking about when trying to shoot the guy in front of me.

The story itself is based loosely on the movie sequel and just seems to go into its own direction. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's just a shame that they didn't have the creative talent to be able to create a compelling story that would make you want to play it. The supporting characters are shallow and irritating which is supported by the painfully wooden voicing. There's just so much about this game that I dislike I can't even begin to think of something good to say. Such a disappointment in comparison to its predecessor and I only hope that if they are planning on bringing out another sequel, they at least spend more time and money on making it worth our hard earned cash.

Aside from that though, it has what to me is a major and disqualifying flaw. The PS2 has really great analog controls. Armored Core 2 doesnt use them. They say they use analog control, but they only use the 2 analog sticks as single push buttons. How can you build a cutting edge mech fighter and not bother to incorporate one of the most significant features of the PS2. This would be bad enough on its own, but the manual controls are extremely slow and ponderous. If something is shooting at you from behind, you can pretty well count on the fact that by the time you can get these hulking beasts turned around you are going to be toast or at least severely damaged. They also accelerate and decelerate with equal lack of alacrity. I might add, that the AI mechs that are attacking you actually appear to have higher performance than you can acheive in your own mech. It is a terrible shame that an otherwise really great game is so severely flawed by such inadequate control.

You are a computerized entity capable of ""hacking"" into the minds of enemies, controlling them and turning battles in your favor by catching squads of your foes off guard. But, imagine that you can only do this once your host shoots an enemy enough times, is close enough to said enemy, and whose aiming abilities make Shadow the Hedgehog look like Master Chief. Such is the world of the painfully generic MindJack.

Story: D-

To illustrate how important plot is to this game, let me first tell you that MindJack allows players to interrupt your campaign at anytime by ""hacking in."" This means that your quasi-successful run of a level could, in theory, be ruined by some idiot who doesn't know his rear end from his elbow. Before you ask, YES, that is indicative of how urgent this game's ""story"" is. From what I gathered, it's about some super-amazing secret agent assigned to escort some woman who has some kind of special ability and a passing resemblance to a loved one, and he's supposed to do... something. Honestly, I stopped paying attention, because the voice acting and dialogue was so pathetic that I stared at the ceiling to keep myself from getting bored. Yes, my dull white ceiling was more engaging than this game's plot.

Gameplay: D

This game is a perfect example of how a brilliant concept can fail miserably if executed wrong. And trust me, it can't get much more wrong than this. The bland, last generation gameplay might be forgivable if FeelPlus had taken the game's main concept a little more seriously and turned it into a compelling element of battle. Instead, they turn it into a sluggish hassle that gives you little motivation to use it, which isn't good considered it's technically the only way to survive throughout the game. Other small things, such as your character walking at a snail's pace outside of battle, and the camera shifting down to the ground whenever you pick up a weapon, become nuisances which further mar what could've been such a great experience. And I refuse to comment on the slapped-on level system, simply because it seems to serve barely any purpose.

Graphics/Sound: They're Bad

Normally, I split the graphics and sound into two more sections and give them their respective grades. In this case, however, I'm willing to make an exception and just be honest: these are both the most laughable aspects of the game. Bland graphics with jagged edges galore are accompanied by the most generic soundtrack this side of a Saturday Night SyFy Original Movie. Problems are worsened to a further degree by the laughable cutscenes, which have some of the worst voice acting since Resident Evil in 1996. It's really sad that a game like this, with a pretty large company putting it out, can scrape by with such dreadful post-production values. Actually, it's not sad: it's embarrassing. Deeply, trulyembarrassing.

Overall: F+

A cool concept, I will admit. If this had been prepped a little more, we would've had a grade-A game on our hands. Instead, we get a rushed piece of junk that will be in the bargain bin faster than the sound of your controller dropping onto the ground as you fall asleep playing this game. And to answer your question, yes, this game made me fall asleep in the middle of a fire fight. So please. Don't let your post-school or after work gaming session turn into a nap. I strongly urge you to play something better, or even replaying a game that you know like the back of your hand. MindJack is a special kind of horrid; it's painfully familiar and dull, and with today's options in the gaming world, there's no reason to spend 60 bucks, or any amount of money, on something like this.

Next, this might as well been named Socom Navy seals, because that is what I feel like I am playing. Third person, behind the back generic military shooter.

The open world kills it. Back in the day, metal gear games had you infiltrate a huge elaborate base. This got thrown out the window in Snake eater, but never to this level. Quality over quantity should be mentioned here. Afganistan, where you will spend most of your time, is a HUGE open area of NOTHING. Its a dessert, with blown out destroyed buildings scattered around, but literally there's nothing there. There's basically no interior locations, which is one thing that makes me hate open world games. Its so insanely boring and repetitive, especially since areas/bases are re-used over and over again for later missions. You sit back and are like ""wait, didn't I just infiltrate this base a few missions ago?""

The biggest issue which is what actually makes me hate this game is what you find out at the end. I will not spoil it, but its all a huge lie and slap in the face. A full metal gear title (perhaps the last one ever) dedicated to literally nothing of weight story wise. Like I said I won't spoil it, but when you do find out, you will be rolling your eyes. Without spoiling it, let's just say I would have actually enjoyed following the ""other"" character on their adventure.

Now with all that being said, the game itself is good I guess, if you like socom navy seals. It definitely is a good time killer, but never was I like ""oh my god, this is amazing"". It was always like ""meh, this is alright I guess"". If Metal Gear wasn't stamped all over it, then I might have a far more favorable perspective, but it doesn't.

Between the two, I've probably bought over 100 different video games through Amazon for a dozen different game systems and computers.  The Orange Box is, without a doubt, the WORST game purchase I have ever made here.  Not only do I feel completely cheated, not only do I feel as if I am in fact owed several hundred dollars in frustration fees, I actually think my overall interest in video games has been damaged by this monstrous piece of marketing vomit masquerading as a playful gamer utopia.  That is how ridiculous this piece of Trojan Horsed garbage is.

The culprit is a smarmy little ferret of a program called ""Steam"".  I don't know who came up with this, but I hope they get hit by a bus and buried in a fire ant den.  Simply put, ""Steam"" is an Orwellian nanny program that requires you to basically convert your computer into an Internet-enabled marketing survey to even access the games you ""own"" (but that Steam controls).  Once upon a golden time, when you bought a game you could put the CD in your computer and simply play it, perhaps with an activation key.  But with Steam, you have to set up an entire account larded with nefarious third party vendors just to have a fighting chance of even downloading the games that are supposedly just included in the Orange Box.  Fantastic.

And guess what - there is no mention of Steam anywhere in The Orange Box.  NONE.  The entire instruction manual for the Orange Box consists of a single two-sided set of control instructions for the actual games.  I guess they just forgot to print the ""Oh, By the Way, You Need Officially Licensed Steam Spyware To Install or Play Any Of These Games, Suckers"" liner.

Even with the mouse sensitivity turned all the way down, the aiming sight moves too fast.  Not only does it move too fast, it moves in stops and starts instead of smoothly.  So don't think the mouse patch makes this game playable.

Also, the graphics in the PC version are unbelievably bad.  They're worse that the original Gamecube and PS 2 versions. I've heard there is a graphics patch you can download, but with the mouse working so poorly in the game there's no point.  My advice to all the RE 4 fans out there is to get the Wii version.  It looks beautiful, and with the added ease of aiming with the Wiimote it's much more enjoyable to play.

I'd like to touch base on the campaign and multiplayer separately:

The Campaign:
Somewhat unique. After completing a campaign level, the player is granted the ability to customize their starting loadout for that particular campaign level.
Example - you can now play through the same level again, but starting with extended mags on your primary weapon. We've seen this before in some other shooters, but at least it allows for some replay value. Overall the campaign is not very engaging. The story is just plain bland.

The Multiplayer:
More or less this is the same multiplayer as always. The pick ten system is the newest addition. It simply allows for further customization of one's class setup.
Some good strides have been made to make this game more balanced. With a series of hotfixes and patches, previously overpowered class setups have now been weakened to create an even playing field.
Other areas where Trearch has failed this game are in the lag, spawn and probation systems. I do understand that lag is not an easy fix. There are many factors and variables involved. The spawn and probabtion systems are easy fixes and Trearch has done nothing to fix them.
The probation system puts players on probation for 1:00, 5:00 or 10:00. This means that they can not join a multiplayer game for said amount of time due to the following reasons I've noticed: getting booted from a pregame lobby, leaving a game early, the host quits, you turn off your system and go to work during a game :(

Overall:
I'd give this game 1.3/5 stars. Good for some entertainment, but Trearch needs to fix lag, spawns and the probabtion system for this to even be a 3 star worthy game.",A lackluster experience,1365465600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

 The game featured a basic HUD with two annoyingly large bars, placed above and below it. That was the first thing I noticed. Next I saw that the terrain was sort of fuzzy, and my gun wasn't all that impressive either.

 ""OK...,"" I said to myself. ""Why don't I try walking around and see if this gets any better?"" So I did. Guess what? No gun sway! Every stinkin FPS game I've every seen had some sort of movement with the gun (Ok, maybe not Wolfenstein 3d, but still!).

This is not worth even calling a game in my opinion. The fact you have to take your Digimon partner to the bathroom every 5minutes made me giveup my first game after a while of torturing myself and hoping it got better but kept getting more disapointed. If you don't take your partner to the bathroom it poops on the ground, and if you walk too close after he eats it. And the only way to clean it is for him to eat it(and it gets harder to avoid the more ''accidents'' your partner makes. Instead of a flash or something it makes you wait for your Digimon to use the potty. The character who is human don't ever eat or use the toilet(as far as i have seen), which is odd since your character is supposed to be a boy from the physical world, and your partner Digimon is supposed to be a digital monster(so you would think the reverse would be more likely).

So you are left with 2 options run to the bathroom to keep your partner from having an ''accident''  or let him have accidents and once he eats so many he'll digivolve into Numemon Who is supposed to happen to digimon who are poorly trained and don't have personal cleanliness(but if you train and still make a few accidents but always feed your partner when he's hungry he will still end up Numemon). And if your traveling to follow the story, it's hard to time it so you find your way to the next bathroom before the next ''accident'' occurs.

i will not buy or rent any of the next games, because this was such a failure. i mean do you train your dog to use the toilet, then watch him everytime he goes..?

AGVN should review this, i mean the game is not fun at all what i have played.

I received my Wii U and spent the next 5 hours trying to download the data for the update that's required before you can really do anything. I would receive errors after every 1-10 minutes of download time.  I even got on the nintendo support line and received an hour of help from one of their tech guys.  It took over four hours for the download to complete and then half an hour for it to install. Then, I thought my trials were over, but no! I go to play a game and - guess what? The system cannot read the disc. I try another disc. and another. and even the one that came with the system! Nothing! It cannot read any discs!

Now, onto more positive:  I went out the following day to buy a bundled Nintendo Wii U deluxe system from Target - it was actually CHEAPER than this Skylanders bundle and it's the deluxe version with a game I actually would play (Mario 3D world), not this Skylanders thing.  When I went to set  up the Deluxe Wii U, the upgrade download took about 5 minutes and it works perfectly.

I've read the huge amount of bad reviews here on amazon and other sites and fruns, but since I'm a Star Wars BattleFrontII PC version fanatic, I had to see how was the gameplay and graphics with my own eyes. 1 word : Frustrating (with Capital ""F""). A game made by amateurs, full of bugs and lags that only existed when 3D games where beggining to be released. Same cenarios. Shots do not stop at the walls, they perfurate it and you get hit, even hidden behind a thick wall. I had to restart the game 5 times at at least, AT LEAST !!!, because the character got stuck and would not move, and sometimes in the middle of a intense battle. The bug makes the character even float on the air sometimes. Of all the games I've seen on computer and videogames, this has a graphic engine so amateur that it flicker and lags all the time even on EASY MODE !!!!. If you rotate the camera most of the times it flickers like hell even on my 120hz Sony TV ! I've played on easy mode, less intensive processing to be rendered by the game engine and ps3, and even so, most of times the gameplay just lags like hell. The action becomes slow when that happens, just as if you where using a computer configuration that is not properly for the a PC game. I've just finished playing for the first time Uncharted 2. How come it does not flicker, lag, and have amazing graphics and Unleashed II is so primitive ? Well the graphics are not that bad, but could be 40% better, for the price and the current time; and if you think that it's a sequel that's so famous and long waited, no forgiven shall be given. Very few timesin my life I got frustrated with buying something, feels like been cheated by Lucas Arts, by the way, wich seens every year to get one step lower in professional ""game-making"". I finished the game in a pair of hours. Is a very very very short gameplay and very frustrating. If you think that God of War 3 is fast, this is much much more faster to finish !! Rent it. Do not buy it. I'm a Star Wars fan, and also been playing BattleFront 2 on computer for years, and never seen such Star Wars game so decadent, so full of bugs, lags, and a graphics engine/rendering wich is not the level of what a PS3 could bring/do.

But the game is still very dull and lacks any tension or suspense. You walk through short nearly identical corridors shooting random aliens that pop out and sometimes attack you, sometimes attack an invulnerable NPC, and sometimes run from you or hide behind things. When they hide you can just walk up to them and shoot them. They won't even notice you're there. After a bit you'll come to a door that an NPC needs to fiddle with to get open. So you stand on a platform while aliens attack from all sides and you shoot them. Sometimes an off-screen alien will be hitting you and other than your life bar going down there's no indication anything bad is happening--no sound or video effects. So you have to constantly check your peripherals on these platforms. These missions are boring. Circle strafe and hold down the left mouse button, push v if they aliens get close. Then run through door. Hilariously one of the missions required that all the aliens be killed before the NPCs would continue through the door (and let you progress). I ran through the door too soon and 6 aliens endlessly attacked an NPC while I stood and watched. He shot off in the distance hitting nothing. They stacked on top of each other and smacked him a bunch. He took no damage. Neither did they. So I casually walked up to the most dangerous creature in the galaxy and watched a bit. Eventually I got bored and fired a couple of shotgun blasts into the mighty stack of aliens and they all died and me and the NPCs went through the door together.

Although the graphics are improved they are still not very good. Lighting and shadow effects do not look quite right. They added a hazy blurry filter over everything. I suspect that the purpose of this filter is to hide the low res textures. My suspicions became stronger when I came to an area that had marines trapped in the aliens nest. As I got closer to the marines the blur went away and I noticed the marines looked like a texture from a game from 2002 or so.

The worst part of the game is that it just isn't fun. I'd forgive the silly AI, 2002 era graphics, fuzzy filters, and everything else if it was fun. Or tense and exciting.

(I wouldn't put that on my computer for ANY game.. and I love to play.).. that I went right out and bought the whole shebang.  Collectors edition, book, everything.

 I was that sure and ready to love it. How could I not? Sims 2 gave me hours, weeks, months genuine years of endless entertainment.

How could they have disappointed  me so badly that the game was off my computer and on the floor so quickly?

First of all, the Sims are ugly.  Really, really butt ugly.  The faces look bloated and dead and you cannot fix them.  Believe me, I tried for hours and hours and I could not come up with anything I would want to play with.
Second of all, they took away everything with the game play that made it so engrossing for people like me.  Storytelling.

The freedom to go anywhere in the hood is great.. its just ruined by the fact that once you get there your Sim goes inside and you sit outside wondering what is going on in there.  It sinks in that you paid good money for a video game of staring at a roof and listening to crowd noises inside.. but it's kind of a relief because the roof is a lot prettier to look at then the Sims are anyway.

Also, the spiders didn't make any sense whatsoever.  Why are there these large spiders everywhere? What's the origin etc...?  No logic behind it.  Who's the lawyer and why doesn't he die when shot?  And the fire-flaming teleporters, where in blazes did they come from.  Again there's no explanation for these off the wall scenes.  One cannot complain about the graphics, but a story is more than pretty pictures--it's got to make sense.  Hence, this script is non-sensical.  Nothing in the story happened for Drake to be attacked by flame-heads...nothing. Bad writing at it's worse.  It's like sitting near the fireplace after Christmas dinner when out of the blue, the headless horseman falls down your chimney and pops into your livingroom without the cordial ho-ho-ho. Uncharted should have never gone to multiplayer--it should have focused everything on the campaign mode and nothing else.  That's why the first Uncharted will always be the best.

The first game was dark, the 2nd was darker and this one was the darkest.  It doesn't come out and say it in words, but it's all in symbolism and silent in the background as one plays.  Another thing you should be aware of is that Naughty Dog copied the desert idea and the ending from the movie ""The Mummy"" (1999).  I'm surprised Universal Studios hasn't sued them for the theft--the studios are always complaining about copyright breeches and here's a big one. That's where they got the idea for the swarming spiders, but in the movie it made perfect sense; in the video game it made no sense whatsoever.  When they have to steal, the game is over.

Awesomeness
1- Buildings detailed are off the chart. If you zoom up all the way, you can actually see the people walking into shops, elevators going up and down in condos, lights turning on and off in houses. This is as detailed as I've ever seen in a game. Sure you can make people bleed like there's no tomorrow but that's just a big pile of red gooey, this game has more than just red color and gooey stuff, it has elevators inside buildings !
2- Easier to draw thanks to the grid guideline
3- Better transportation engine. Do not get discouraged by the AI behavior of first-sight-opportunity-turning. What this means is that the AI (Artificial Intelligence or the computer algorithm in this game) will turn soon as it reaches a road that is the shortest path to a destination. This decision is made without taking into consideration of the road capability (avenue or dirt road). So an AI will choose to drive on a  dirt road that is 1 nanometer shorter than an avenue. Yes I know it's a dumb idea at first sight, but if you learn your sims behavior like where they go to work, where to shop, where to relax, this algorithm works perfectly. Find out for yourself.
4- Low CPU power consumption because most of the simulation is served by the server.
5- Your city is always there. Your cities are saved on the server so you don't have to worry they get blown up because your Windows BSOD today.
6- And a lot more awesome stuff

Not-so-awesome and bad

1- Bugs, bugs, bugs. It's 2013 but it's bugs everywhere in this game
1.1 - Train bug - once in a while, one of your cities will no longer get a train visit. Your train station will have 2000 passengers waiting indefinitely. Sure you can bulldoze the station and replace it, but that may or may not work. There is not a fix yet as of this writing. If you have more than 1 train stations, chances are incoming trains will visit the first station only leaving the remaining stations having inane waiting time like 9000 minutes. Hopefully your nearby clinics can treat your frustrated sims during this ever lasting waiting time.
1.2 - Freight bug - Doesn't matter how many industrial zones I have, my city still has the exact same amount of UN-fullfilled freight orders. I even created 2 cities with just residential and industrial, same problem. I mean do I have to create the entire regions with industrial zones just to feed 1 city? This is ridiculous
1.3 - No shopper bug - You could have a load of commercial zones but still has thousands unsatisfied shoppers? What give? I don't know may be because you specialize in tourism and now all the commercial zones are developing into Happy Inns. So your sims are complaining to you that their skyline condos are 1000 times better than the Happy Inns, and that's how you have abandoned commercial zones. It's non-sense and make perfect sense at the same time. To have tourism or not have tourism is the decision my sims (but I EA makes the decision here, not you the buyer)

2- Online mode only - I can't play the game at work b/c our proxy blocks it. Now what am I going to do with my 1 hour lunch? Eat food? That's child play, I play Sim City !

3- No tera-forming (god mode) ability. All the cities look similar, a slab of land, water pond, few mountains. And that's how EA taught me to grow up, to be a closed minded, zombie thinking person. Thanks EA, I will make sure my kids grow up away from this teaching, yes and I too.
Let me keep this short for you, EA doesn't want your creativity because it's too hard for 3 years old kids. Think about this, if all the cities are made similar to each other, any kids or brain-dead adult and watch a youtube video to build the exact cities. Whereas if you give people tera-forming ability, you are practically asking them to think before they play, and EA probably assumes that is too much for us, yes us. What do you think EA, that I'm stupid? Well sir, that's the job for our republicans.
4- Cities are too small. I can't even build manhatan with the largest map they got and all manhatan got are just squares and rectangles. Wait till you try to build California, that's when you realize EA really got your noodles burning.

5- Greatworks never get built
It has been 5 days and my space center has not been approved yet for building. This is completely ridiculous because the server is overloaded. I can't believe that I am playing a single player game and I have to wait for 5 days for a building to build? It feels more like I have to pay money to EA everytime I need to build something within a game that already paid for. This is such a money cut-throat scamming game.

This is boring and very sad. Claire's (the girl partner, if you chose a boy main character) heart rate (health) just kept dropping because I couldn't figure out how to build the fire. When I finally found the wood, her health dropped to 43% and kept dropping even after I made the fire.

By the way, building the fire was not fun. You have to keep pressing the L and R buttons (DS owners KNOW these buttons are fragile and will stop functioning if pressed to hard or *way* to many times, especially the L-button [Google it if you don't believe me]) repeatedly until a bar turns red, then you blow into the mic to start the fire. Nice, except you HAVE TO do this EVERYTIME the fire goes out, EVERY night or the girl will freeze to death and die.

Making food from clams and sea-weed was cute, but frustrating, as it did not bring health points back to 100%. The amount of HP recovered is based apon how well the food was enjoyed or prepared. If it was not enjoyed, you got a small amount of HP. The most I saw when the meal was OK was 19 pts. By the way, what is the POINT of having a REST system if it ONLY applies to you? That's right - the girl partner (Clair) will NOT recover health at all, even when she is resting with you.

EVERY RPG game in HISTORY has you recovering HP while sleeping, not this game. Food didn't heal her: one time she blatantly refused to eat (""No thank you, I'm not hungry."") while her HP was dropping!?

1.  Sorry, Ubi.  If you think that pirates are not going to think their way around this one, think again.
2.  SecuROM interferes with my burner.  I do a LOT of home video creation with Sony Vegas Pro ($500+ software).  Do you think that I'm going to WANT to install a $49 software package that's going to ruin that, not to mention the hell-on-earth experience of REMOVING this piece of junk?

The makers of ""Lost: Via Domus"" faced a nearly impossible task:  create a story-based game that fits credibly into a show that's already got three seasons under its belt and that comes to a decent conclusion even though the show won't end for several more years.  Unfortunately, not only did Ubisoft Montreal flub this one, they also forgot the basics of making an interesting and enjoyable video game.

You play as a passenger on flight 815 who suffers from amnesia after the crash.  You meet with characters from the show and travel to island locales while trying to piece together your past.  The interaction with other characters is very lock-step, i.e. you say this, they reply that.  This linear pattern becomes an overwhelming attribute to the entire game to the point that you feel like you're watching a (very mediocre) episode rather than actually performing anything yourself.

Your memory comes back via dream sequences where you have to ""photograph"" select elements to unlock new information.  As meager as that sounded, I've just made it sound like more fun than it even is.  You replay the same looped dream over and over again trying to balance framing and focus to get just the shot that it's looking for.  This element of gameplay alternates between bland and flat-out tedious.

In between these revelation sequences, you go on simple quests that involve familiar show elements such as the hatch, the Black Rock, the Others, etc.  Again, it's all very linear stuff - go there, get that item, bring it back here, etc.  There are holes in the script that allow you to break out of this sequence, but you still end up getting handcuffed by the game anyway.  For instance, you collect coconuts (suddenly it's Gilligan's Island) and other island goodies to trade for useful wares.  I bucked the system and saved up enough to get a gun from Sawyer earlier than the developers intended, but was then completely unable to use it until much later in the game when it was necessary for the story.  But this led to ridiculous situations in the meantime - for example, if I'm carrying a loaded gun, why would I allow myself to be put into a holding cell and stripped of all my possessions?  There should at least be options for how to handle situations, but there aren't.  This also reduces replayability to zero.

The graphics are generally very good and the facial models of familiar characters are well-done, even if their movements are a bit robotic.  Voice talent is provided from many of the show's actors, but the ones who are substitutes really stick out - particularly Sawyer, who sounds like a cross between Ross Perot and Yosemite Sam.

The only upside to the game is the ease of achievements. If you're into boosting your gamerscore, then you've come to the right place.  With the entire game taking only about eight hours to complete, it's the easiest 1000 points you'll ever rack up.

Some of the freezing issues have been eradicated, but the overall interface is typical EA - worthless at best.

I am a mature gamer (30+) and regularly play with a group of friends, it is next to impossible to get them all into one game, and once you do, you inevitably get a bunch of screaming kids, racists, etc because EA didn't have the foresight to add a ""friend only"" option?!?!?!

Not everybody knows that:
You cannot play this offline
You need a constant connection to the destiny servers which is very unreliable get ready for your game to be interrupted even with a good connection.
You need to reach level 5 before you can do multiplayer.
This is not a proper mmo like eve online
Despite all the hype prepares to be underwhelmed both by the lack of depth of the story or any real action do not believe the trailers.

This is not open world or sandbox there's nothing to explore you go on these dull missions kill someone then go back to the tower.
The enemy just spawn in the same place.
Also the story ends at the introduction and only gets mentioned every now and again

Story
I really wanted this to be good but alas it's just not worth your time an empty lonely game experience with a story that could have been amazing. If you're a story driven person I'm afraid like many online only games the main story just becomes a back story it's so sad.

Action
Also if you're not into level grinding then you may want to give this a miss as the enemy have main spawn points which they don't go out of and not long after killing all the enemy they will spawn back again.
The a.i's are not as intelligent as those used in say killzone or halo (throw a grenade at an elite he will try and commando roll out of the way not stand there like a moron)all in all they enemy are not fun to fight but pretty boring. The only interesting action comes from multiplayer but with that many better multiplayers' out there and more coming out again you'd better spend your money elsewhere.

Levels
As I mentioned the levels have nothing to explore in them if you're expecting something like skyrim or fallout 3 with a living world populated by interesting events, locations and npc's prepare to be shocked.
Take earth for instance you will have to keep going back to the same location for all of the missions so in real terms destiny is actually very small but this is the same for the other locations off planet.

Conclusion
At first glance it really seem's good but after a few hours play and then a few more you realize there is not actually a lot there in terms of story characters or action.
Don't get me wrong I love bungie but I just don't know where it went all wrong.(although from what I understand some of bungie went to 343 industries to look after halo maybe that's where all the talent went)

When the game was first revealed, it showed so much potential. Everything looked so beautiful. Fast forward 2-3 years to release and we get a product that doesn't live up to the hype. Instead, we are greeted with a steaming plate of disappointment.

There is one thing that truly pissed me off as this game neared release. The developer for the game always dodged certain questions and answered them indirectly. Allow me to explain one important question they avoided: They did NOT at any point before the game's release say there wouldn't be multiplayer. They just said there would be a very small chance that you'd see other players in the massive world.

On launch day, two streamers managed to get on the same planet, same outpost, and talk to the same NPC all at the same time. But guess what? They couldn't see nor interact with one another. The developer gave a sketchy response to this, and pretty much dropped from the face of the Earth (or in this case, Reddit).

I truly felt cheated. Not only was there no real multiplayer in this game (which had SO much potential!), the game is quite repetitive after the first few hours of gameplay. Now for those that don't know, the game's main goal is to reach the center of the universe. As much as I now despise this game, I will not spoil it for those who want to give it a try.

The only thing that this game had going for it was its 18 quintillion ""randomly generated"" planets and animals/NPCs. I can tell you right now, that you will be disappointed after 10-15 planets. Sure it is cool for the first few planets, but then you realize that they are almost similar to one another with another skin just pasted on top. On another note, the random animals you will encounter are NOTHING like the ones in the trailer you saw a while ago. These creatures are randomly generated and have no climate preference or traits for said climate. For example, you may end up seeing a green floating crab with tentacles on a burnt down scorching planet. It just makes no sense.

The game follows a repetitive formula: Land on planet, grab resources, fly out of planet, restock resources, eventually build materials to warp, warp to new system in hopes of reaching the Center of the Universe, rinse and repeat. This got old and boring really fast. There has even been a case where someone got a fully loaded suit and ship all on his starting planet!

On another note, this game lost 90% of it's player base just one week after release. If this isn't a red flag, then I do not know what is!

If you still have plans to purchase this game, please purchase this when it goes on sale. It is truly not worth the $60.

1.0,False,"06 15, 2012",A3BRP0Y489744F,B00178630A,MSB,"In most games like Diablo, no amount of gear will allow you to defeat an encounter if you don't know what you are doing. Skill is mandatory, gear is merely helpful.

Diablo 3 is the opposite. Neither are required until you hit Hell difficulty, but after that no amount of skill will allow you to defeat a mob or encounter if you are not geared for it. Gear is mandatory, skill is merely (slightly) helpful.

The overwhelming majority of your deaths are unavoidable. Mobs teleport to you from off the screen and kill you in one shot. They chain you, wall you, spawn under you, jump at you with no warning, surround themselves with invincible minions, and otherwise kill you in ways you absolutely CAN NOT avoid. Unless, of course, you have the necessary gear.

And if you think you can work around this by kiting or taking down mobs slowly and patiently, think again. If you don't kill difficult mobs quickly, you are punished by an unavoidable death (enrage/kill timers). That's right, you are killed for hit/run tactics, kiting, being patient, or otherwise trying to use skill instead of rushing headlong. They aren't exactly subtle with their cues to go buy gear.

So how do you get gear? Not by farming, that's for sure. The chances of getting drops that are useful are exceedingly low, and Blizzard has been quick to remove any farming spots players have found. The only option which doesn't involve months (literally) of farming is the Auction House. You are not going to farm your own gear, you are not going to progress without gear - you have to buy it. And the best items are naturally either on the RMAH or up for ridiculous sums of gold that you have to buy on the RMAH.

This led to another problem, of course: ridiculously-oversimplified skills, runes, mob mechanics etc. This is due to the one-hit mechanics mentioned above. If mobs could be countered with skill or cast spells/abilities which could be avoided with skill, then gear wouldn't be mandatory. Mobs only use gear-check abilities which can *not* be avoided or countered with skill. Naturally, once you have the necessary gear those unavoidable attacks no longer kill you instantly and you can progress so long as you know how to click your mouse.

There is essentially no skill involved in any aspect of the game. There is no reward system, either - you don't get any usable gear or special items or even extra gold for taking down a difficult mob/boss. Instead, you have one big frustration loop. You progress until you run into a brick wall, Blizzard's cue that you need to make purchases on the AH. You die until you get sick of it, go buy gear, and then progress with relative ease until you run into another brick wall.

And since gear-check mechanics are all that you ever see, your skills are all pointless. It really doesn't matter which you use, how well you use them, how you choose to play - none of those things has any real impact on your game. It's all about gear, which means the Auction House.

Like many people, I had assumed the RMAH would simply be a distraction, an optional feature some would make use of and the rest could ignore. That's just not the case. Every aspect of the game is designed to funnel players into the auction house, and the changes made to the game because of that fact completely ruined it. Nearly every complaint about the game can be traced back to the RMAH (even online-only play, as dupes/cheating/hacks/etc. are all just as prevalent - it only serves to promote use of the AH).

They'd already destroyed the WoW franchise. Now they've destroyed the Diablo franchise. Starcraft 2 is all that's which has any hope left for it, though it's currently also riddled with oversimplified mechanics. And since they can't turn that into a cash cow, it's been largely ignored since its release and the expansion is likely still a year away.

The illumination itself is nice, the blue is crisp (multicolor) LED's would have been even better. The characters accessed by a shift (e.g. $) could have been brighter (even at higher brightness they do not really stand out).

The keyboard itself looks nice and tilts towards utilitarian.  The build seems nice, the plastic feels premium and not cheap.

1.0,False,"11 17, 2010",AJ8VUUCO9RMX6,B003R3JNMI,D.L.,"Let me get straight to the point.  This game blows and is in my estimation, an early candidate for worst game of the year.  The history of Harry Potter hasn't always been a good one.  They have ranged from fair to acceptable, but have never really reached the heights of imagination from the rich source material that they came from.  However, you could not deny that they were each good, solid efforts with the next iteration improving from the one before it.  Then comes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1.  Gone are the free roaming explorations of Hogwarts.  This time Harry and friends are on the run.  And with this one bold plot course in the book, goes any semblence of a decent Harry Potter game.  What developer EA Bright Light did so well in the previous game in terms of sandbox gaming is now replaced by a clunky third person shooter.  This gameplay change could have been a welcomed divergence to the previous games if only were the mechanics not so broken.

You start off playing as Harry with one main spell that eventually swells to half a dozen or so while progressing through the game.  I'm okay with the variety, yet I never found myself using anything other than the stupify spell which seemed more effective against enemies.  There is a cover mechanic yet good luck finding a barrier to hide behind that will stick and keep you from getting hit with spell projectiles.  The lock on mechanic is slippery and you'll often find yourself casting spells at empty air when it was focused on an enemy a second ago. Even more odd is that in some parts of the game, the view will shift from a third person perspective to a first person perspective without any rhyme or reason other than the developers trying to shake up the dull gameplay.  There was one instance in the game that literally had me tearing my hair out.  Harry is hidden under his invisibility cloak and must sneak around to accomplish a mission without being discovered.  Once the mission is over, Harry must then sneak back to the original point in which he started in order to trigger a cut scene.  The difficulty level then spikes and all of a sudden you're being discovered without anyone near you.  I must have tried this level a dozen or so times before I finally got past it, yet I have no idea if it was due to my skill or just chance.

The graphics are equally bad.  Though Harry, Hermione and Ron look detailed enough, they inhabit a world of muddy textures and dull environments.  The cut scenes seemed rushed and unfinished and failed to stitch together any semblence of a coherent plot.  Harry is given a mission to find the remaining Horcruxes, yet he then must partake in side missions that involve him sneaking out of a dragon's lair (don't ask how he got there), rescuing muggles and freeing captured wizards.  Weird.

I never expected a great Harry Potter game, but I could always expect a competent one that offered me a couple hours of fun as a fan of the series.  Deathly Hallows completely flipped the formula and instead offered a game so ugly and crippled by its gameplay mechanics that it's a shame that the best book in the series could not serve as inspiration for a good game.

Graphic-wise: It's the standard average for a PS2 game. Nothing terrible, but nothing spectacular. I'm assuming it would be better on the PS3 or Xbox360, since they have better graphics.

Soundtrack: This is perhaps the only positive feature this game has. It had some beautifully composed moments in some scenes.

Gameplay: I found the game anything but entertaining. It felt more like a chore trying to get through levels where most of the time your obstacles are just booby traps or exploring through dark-lit locations. There are monsters here and there but they don't exactly add anything to the game. They felt more like extras. Even the boss fights consist of shooting like crazy until they fall--you'd think there would be a strategy involved since nearly all the levels have strategies you need to develop to get by them.

There was nothing unique about the game that I saw made this game Alone in the Dark. It felt like an average PS2 action game you'd pick up on the shelf. Or leave on the shelf for that matter..

Story: According to others, the PS3 version of the story plays out very differently. But the PS2 version is anything but entertaining. The game starts off on an interesting note but then the storytelling just goes downhill after that. The characters do nothing to move the story along and were far from interesting and became boring/annoying very quickly.

The story dragged on for me. The levels and obstacles you had to get through to get answers and continue the story was not worth the time. The story is also very confusing where the ending didn't make much sense.

Technical Issues: A LOT! When they say ""Alone in the Dark"" they aren't kidding! The levels are so incredibly darkly-lit. Even when I turned my television brightness up, it hardly made a difference. The game did not have a brightness control either so for the entire game I was running around very much blind.

There were places in the game where the sound just dropped a few levels. So I constantly had to turn the volume up.

Overall: Weighing out everything about this game, it's not worth the time or money. The only reason it's survival-horror is because of how incredibly bad this game was made.

It looked like a great fantasy story, similar to what you'd see in the older Final Fantasy games.  When it came in, however, I was greatly disappointed...

I played this game for about 2 hours, and had to turn it off.  The first 30-40 minutes were character creation.  I spent a fair amount of time to make an avatar only to find out that he's ""the new guy"" and has no role what-so-ever in the story.  Instead, they smack you with an angsty teenage boy as a main character!  Absolutely nothing after the character creation grabbed me.  The graphics and sound are OK.  The smidge of story that was presented seemed quite lame, and the characters introduced were completely uninteresting.  I made it as far as the second save point (somewhere in the plains right outside the first town.)  The combat system seemed like a variation of what was in FFXII.  Combat was to frequent and boring.

1.0,False,"06 18, 2008",A2MYRRBXB3WTNO,B00140P9BA,Craig H. Dolphin,"I am not reviewing the content of the game except to say that Bioware has previously never disappointed me with its RPG's, and I expect Mass Effect is no different. I was highly excited to buy this game.

However, I like many others, canceled my pre-order when I discovered that I was not actually going to be buying the game, even though I was going to be spending $50 on it.

The truth is that this game comes with a new generation of digital rights management software called SecuROM. This DRM system does many things.

First, if your gaming computer does not have internet access then you cannot activate and play the game at all. Bioware/EA does not want your business.

Second, Bioware allows you three 'activations' only. Activations are tied to your computer's hardware and operating system configuration. If you ever reinstall windows, or upgrade a videocard, or add a new hard-drive, or even a simple cooling fan, you will need to use up another activation to keep playing mass effect on your computer. Several customers used up all three activations within a couple of weeks of buying the game as they tried reinstalling windows, or upgrading hardware, to overcome technical difficulties. Once you run out of activations and try to play the game again, you get a message informing you that you have no more activations left and that you should buy another copy of the game to get more. If you do some searching, you will find out that EA says that they may provide you more activations, on a case by case basis, if you contact them. They refuse to state what circumstances will be considered acceptable to them before allowing you more activations. At a minimum, you may need to provide a copy of your purchase receipt. You do actually keep your purchase receipts for $50 games right?

Third, SecuROM is a highly controversial piece of software. Its existence is not disclosed on the box, nor do you get notified that it is being installed on your machine. SecuROM installs registry keys that are not deleted when you uninstall the game. And these registry keys use illegal characters to prevent the user from being able to delete them manually. You must use third-party software to do so.

Fourth, SecuROM can include a module that provides 'information' to the game publisher. Bioware claims it is not using that module to do so, but there is no way to verify this.

Fifth, Bioware cancelled the re-validate online every 5-10 days policy that they originally stated the game would have. Expect to see this return in future games.

Lastly, Bioware/EA provides no method to de-activate a computer once it has been activated. Uninstalling the game from one computer does not free up that activation. Therefore, your ability to sell your copy of the game second-hand, guaranteed in the Copyright Act (Doctrine of First Sale) has  been violated by Bioware/EA. Expect to see some lawsuits before too much longer.

If you think I'm blowing up the DRM issue out of proportion then, by all means, go ahead and buy this game. While you are able to play it I'm sure you'll be very happy with it. However, do not expect to be able to keep playing it years into the future without paying extra for more activations.

The same DRM system is also intended for use on EA games like Spore, and likely also Dragonage, plus many others.

If you are concerned about this kind of practice becoming the industry standard, then I urge you not to spend your money on this game or any other titles from EA until they abandon this DRM fiasco. There are games publishers who take a different approach (for example, the game Sins of a Solar Empire is DRM free) and who are much more appreciative of your custom.",Rental versus purchase: Beware,1213747200,"1,041",{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

 1--You cant leave the remote covers (sleeves/jackets whatever you want to call them) on when recharging the batteries (not even the skinny silicone covers can be left on)
 2--You cant charge the battery unless they are connected to the Wii remote... there goes my spare battery idea I had *eyeroll*
3-- The thing is temperamental, the remotes have to be placed in the charger JUST so and if bumped (like trying to place the next remote in JUST so) it gets jostled and won't charge)
4-- The amount of time the batteries that came with it stay charged is a JOKE! Less than a day, seriously!
5-- Thing didn't even come with a wall plug, just a USB plug that you connect to the back of your Wii (which only gives you 2 USBs to begin with so if you have it connected to say a couple of microphones for Sing It, one has to come unplugged to let the remotes charge and then swapped around EVERY SINGLE TIME your two little girls want to play their game using their mics.

1.0,False,"08 31, 2009",AYAS7V5UY9FRZ,B0012N94WO,saeed,"I had great expectations when I first saw the videos and heard the news on the new resident evil game for I have been a huge fan of the series, especially RE2 and RE Code Veronica (Best RE of all time!!!). RE 4 had already been disappointing some years ago, with all that action and no puzzles and shock moments implented anymore.
Well, and after playing the RE 5 Demo several times, here are my first impressions:

- an UNBELIEVABLE LONG loading time. I actually went to the bathroom, got me something to drink, checked my mails, then I got to play. That really has to change until the launch of the game, but i doubt it.
- chrashed several times, very unstable. hopefully that is just an error as to the demo and not the full game.
- graphics are really stunning as to the sourroundings (africa in far cry 2 looked better, but it is still great) and characters. the zombies look kinda weird. and after you killed them they disappear in some sort of bubbles, looked like house of the dead, looked really silly.
- the BIGGEST flaw: this DAMN CO-OP mode!!! Don'T get me wrong, playing co-op with a friend is kewl, although the splitscreen was implented in a weird way in the corners of the screen, but okay. but if you are a solo player you are stuck with your miserable A.I. partner that ALWAYS runs in front of you, around you, 2cm away from your nose like a bee anxious to get some honey. it is SOO annoying. and it does not matter in the least if you are doing everything the right way, meaning giving her ammunition, herbs, covering, etc, she dies, and THAT happens a lot. And THAT means: GAME OVER!!! I want to play RE, I want to die and I want to finish the game with MY skills, not with some screwed up A.I. figure that can'T even walk right.
- the sound is okay as long as you just focus on the surroundings and the zombie sounds. the weapon sounds are some of the lamest sounds I have EVER heard in a game.
- Difficulty: well, the past RE games have always been easy in the beginning and sometimes got really hard during the game and especially in the end with defeating the final boss. but now: SINCE WHEN does a zombie NOT DIE when you shot him directly in the head? with your pistol u have to shoot at last 2 times in the head or 4-5 at the body of the zombie to kill him. and considering that you got much less ammo than EVER in a RE game this is pretty annoying.

Overall I am very very angry, sad and disappointed and immediately cancelled my pre-order. First I wanna see how the final game looks like and which of those flaws have been erased, but I fear there won't be much done about it. If it costs 10 some time in the future I guess you can buy it.

You can meet other sims and socialize, learn certain skills (such as Guitar and Athletic), go to work, clean your house, and purchase (a very limited selection of) furniture and decorations for your home.  You can get married but I don't think you can have baby sims in this version.  That being said, that's really all there is to this game.

I understand that other ""Sims"" titles have much fewer limitations to them.  However, I don't exactly understand why anyone would want to play these kinds of games.

This review may be updated as time goes along based on the gameplay experience that Blizzard may change. As for now though, the launch and current gameplay isn't worth $59.99. In fact, I waited a few days just in-case something like this would happen and I was right. They did indeed have several issues.

I am very disappointed with this game. I feel that this is rather not a sequel at all to Diablo 2. Perhaps it would be an enhanced edition of the first series: Diablo 1, but not 2. Its gameplay mechanics and features are not worthy enough to be called a ""sequel"" to the game. I don't feel any resemblance to Diablo 2, but a closer resemblance of Diablo I in this game.

Only 4 players are only allowed onto a game. Compared to Diablo 2, 8 players were allowed. I really don't think this game is intended to be a Massive Online RPG if onlya maximum of 4 players are allowed into a game. This is ridiculous. I really do hope that they increase it to at least 6 players because 4 players just feels too few for a MMORPG.

For now, don't play Diablo 3. Not when the game is incomplete or half-baked. This game clearly needs re-adjustments before it can be taken seriously by players. I'd give this game another year to fix the major problems and then see the results.

Now come the truth.

The awsome gameplay!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The game play remain in two words: ""left"" or ""right""
For the new generations it is a joke. I prefer much better the sonic on xbox 360 ( it s more fun than going only left or right), Despite that the sonic on xbox 360 was not like the old sonic on gamecube.
The gameplay could realy be more complete than that. ( if you want to learn how to turn left or right i think this is the game for you)
I think that sega was so pissed off and wanted to do the gameplay realy simple and didn t want to complicate their life for the gameplay.

For the levels it s realy awsome!!!
YOU KNOW WHAT IS AWSOME WITH THE LEVELS? IS YOU CAN DO A DIFFERENT LEVEL BUT YOU WILL STILL STAY IN THE SAME MAP!!!.
What the hell, they could put more maps then keeping repeting the maps a million times after that you get over it and you say that game is going back to where it was.
But it s important to know that you have different things to do. For example if you do the principal quest in a map you will have an other objective like collecting the rings on the same map. ( sometimes we don t realy know what to do and going through the map again a million time)

Well anyway sonic the secret of the rings is realy good in graphics, the sounds ( nothing special), the gameplay AMAZING(it is a joke for the new generation)!!! and the graphisms are realy good.

There is also a lot of DRM. You can't even play a local game on your computer without connecting to Battle.net. The game also requested that I open many ports on my firewall. None of the other games that I own do this.

The game designers also made stupid choices for no apparent reason. For example, you can only change your name once! Why is there a limit at all? That makes no sense!

The campaign mode is terrible. The designers didn't separate the tutorial from the campaign. So, in the campaign, the game gradually lets you build different units. For example, in the second mission you only have Marines, Medics, SCVs, Barracks, Command Center, and Supply Depot. Each new mission introduces a new unit or building that you can use. This is a pathetic way to make a campaign. I wish that on the first mission you had access to all units and buildings. Also, the first 10 missions are extremely boring.

The achievements at the end of each stage are also stupid. The game doesn't tell you what you need to do to earn the achievements before or during the mission. Then, at the end of the mission you will realize that you didn't complete all of the achievements because you didn't know what the achievements were. Also, if you want to replay the stage in order to get the achievements, you will have to reload the game at an earlier save.

The game itself is just crap, but you can read all the reviews at metacritic or something for the reasons why.
For me, the worst part of the game is the menu system. It's by far the most unintuitive interface I have ever seen. Nothing is where it should be, making any change to anything takes for-friggin-ever, and it's all buried under a completely asinine right stick menu (I use an xbox controller) with all kinds of ""hidden"" tricks and things most people don't want to have to play a guessing game to get to.

In my case, all I wanted to do was to turn off the LEDs and set one of the side buttons to be the middle-mouse button, but I can't do that without giving Razer my email address (for spam/marketing purposes), sending the unique serial number of the device, and associating that serial number to my IP email address, name, mailing address, a list of all software installed on my computer, and probably much much more.

Some time back in 2012, I remember reading news stories and Razer and their spyware. Then I forgot. Today when I got my new mouse, I remembered when I couldn't use it without giving my personal privacy and security.

Why the hell does this mouse need to connect to the Internet?

You have the easy PS2 feel, dual-analog control pads, and a comfortable fit. You can install the drivers or not. It doesn't really make a difference because Windows will recognize it.

The problem with this Gamepad is that it is not very durable. I bought and tested this controller with MVP Baseball 2005 & Need for Speed Underground 2. What happened is, I had to take the controller back 3 times to have it replaced because the analog sticks would give out or get stuck in a certain postion. Now, in MVP Baseball, for example, you need the right stick to dive/slide with. Well, the analog stick stuck to the right in 2 of them I tried, so that ends up leaving you to have automatic fielding because you can't get to the ball when the player is diving for no reason. With Need for Speed, I found that the 1 controller where the left analog stick went out, the cars were just out of control.

There are many reviews online as I have found that confirm that Logitech never addressed this controllers issues. Even Tech. Support kept telling me I had just bought a bad controller when I called them on each one.

Be aware, once the analog stick goes, whether it is 2 days or 2 months, you can't calibrate it. The GamePad is useless. I would suggest you go with Nyko's AirFlo Gamepad instead. I've had no problems with that one.",Problem filled Gamepad,1110758400,149,,

I was considering creating a second account. As of 11-17-05 my account is cancelled. The New Game, also known as the Starter Kit, is the third version of SWG and it is riddled with bugs and incomplete. It is a far inferior product to its previous versions as well. The NG was released after being kept secret for an unknown period of time and allowing players only a two week notice of it being published. Even less time was devoted to it being tested by sources outside of SOE. Trials of Obi Wan and the NG were released in such a manner as to call into question SOE's and LA's ethics. As represented by the employees who post to the forums SOE and LA are uncarring, glib, and/or vastly out of touch with the player community.

Most of these are not new complaints. However, with the release of the NG these problems have escalted to such a degree that the game is no longer playable. While some are content to merely switch games I am not. Simply changing the direction of the flow of money to SOE and LA will not get their attention. I am boycotting all products created by Sony Online Entertainment and Lucas Arts. I encourage others to do the same.

I do not think my actions alone with effect SOE or LA one iota. In fact, I doubt anything will change their policies. The fan base for Star Wars and other properties is sufficiently numerous to mitigate any discontent portion. While some have predicted that the NG will cause the collapse of SWG I believe otherwise. It will lose many current players but those will be replaced by SOE's and LA's new target market. SOE and LA will later use the negative comments and future subscriptions numbers to prove that they were right all along and to dismiss anyone who opposes them as being knee jerk reactionaries who are against change just because they don't like change.

First of all it's 98% percent the same as last year, and the much Hyped Player abilities wich they claim are new... are just last years player roles with new icons and you can see them on the field of play.

though being able to see them on the field has made making adjustments easier as you can see who's covering who, or wich members of your O-line are gonna plow threw the D easier, it still doesn't justify the price nor the Hype generated for this game.

The rosters are soarly wrong, The Bears still have Tank Johnson, who was released months ago, and replaced by Darwin Walker months ago, and yet this simple fix was not made, i am sure there are other holes in this roster as well.

The menu's and over lays are reused from last year, they just made them bigger and a black, When you score and are about to kick a field goal, you see 1st and 10 at the top in white, over Field Goal in orange, wich was last years lettering at the top.

AI and animations have been improved slightly, not as vastly as EA would lead you to believe, some of the new animations actualy cause gameplay problems where the animation was inapropriat at the time. Some players still walk through others, the running back still stubbornly runs into the o-line untill he trips.

The graphix are tweaked, colors and edges do seem more refigned, but given the Hardware out for PC's, there is no reason why PC gamers are stuck with Ps2/Xbox graphics. easpecialy since even mid range budget cards these days are equal or even better than xbox 360 and ps3.

One bright spot is the hall of fame mode, You can now play as one of the players from this years draft, including this actualy makes me play this aspect now. Though the layout of the appartment is troublesome in some spots as clickable items are too close and with a mouse you tend to click the wrong thing half the time.

Sound....OMG, this is the same dreary commentation as last year, nothing new was added, heck, they still call Devin Hester "" number 23"" ... this guy broke an NFL record and a Super Bowl record, and is the first player to ever have the ingame Speed of 100, and you can't even say his name....

The crowd looks terrible and makes almost no noise, unlike in MVP where you can hear the fans saying stuff like ""can i get a hot dog over here"" or the vendors in philly saying ""cheese steak, get your cheese steak."" ASB has none of that. One thing that ASB has on MVP is that the mound visit is better because it gives details on how the pitcher is doing and on the upcoming hitters, but the player attributes are way off. Javy Lopez is given ""weak hitting"" and Pokey Reese is given ""weak speed!"" Are you kidding me!?!?! By they way, the music in ASB sucks, unlike MVP which actually pays real bands to use their music. Another plus for MVP is that there are several different slides you can do in MVP, like hook, head first,(each to both sides of the bag), pop-up, and of course foot first. In ASB you can do straight head first or foot first only. Overall, ASB gets a one out of 10, purely because of it's realistic franchise mode, but EA's MVP gets a 9/10, so DON'T waste your money on ASB! GET MVP AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! By the way, I also wrote a separate review for MVP if you're interested. But there's something I don't understand: Why isn't Kevin Millar in either game?

YES, this game DOES have evil secuROM DRM hidden in the software, but that is =>NOT<= the sole reason why I gave this game 1 star overall.

I have been a long time GTA fan, playing the series way back in the day when the original birds eye view game came out in the late 90s. Time and time again, rockstar has proved its expertise in making an expansive satirical game ahead of its time.

However, on this PC port, Rockstar and Take2 Interactive have seriously dropped the ball.

The game is undeniably addicting, and provides amazing possibilities for game play. The graphics are gorgeous, the world is expansive, and there are a ton of new features which would be a dream come true for me if there was not one teeny flaw with this production:

This PC port should still be in its alpha stages.

Its been nearly a decade since I've bought a game so riddled with errors, sloppy programming, and altogether looks like the afterbirth of console title. Clearly this title was prematurely pushed out just to sneak it in time for the holiday season. To give you a solid idea of what is wrong with the game, let me give you some hard examples of the flaws in its design.

#1- All PC versions of the game have SecuROM (Yes, even the Steam version that I bought. Effectively this means 2 DRMs)
#2- Your high end 2000 dollar PC will struggle to turn out more than 40 fps due to bad programming (I should know, my computer gets around 35 fps. See my specs below)
#3- You are required to register with TWO online accounts (three if you use steam). How much money do you think Take 2 Interactive is getting from selling your consumer rights by forced registry?
#4- Does not work with SLI, has many rendering problems, and the solution is to use a beta driver which in my case BRICKED my computer.
#5- Does not work well with background programs. (Many people recommend shutting down key security programs like your firewall or anti-virus.)
#6- Several errors with multiplayer (remember those 2 mandatory online registration processes, they don't work too with multiplayer)

This is hogwash. I hope this shoddy work bites the corporate executive who forced this game out so quickly. I'd much rather have waited a year and had all these issues removed.

I'd like to rant right now about how Rockstar should have learned from EA's Spore and SecuROM, but apparently over 100 other reviewers have that one well covered, so I'll spare you.

- The gameplay is basically fun for a FPS on the Wii if you've not played any other FPS games on the Wii.
- The in-game cutscenes are relatively entertaining if you buy a lot of B movies and like to talk to the TV screen.
- Playing this is better than watching paint dry, unless that paint is on biplane crashing to the ground.
- The AI is basically worthless, so if you like killing mindless AI enemies, you've found your game.

Bad Points:

- The graphics are just plain horrible.  This looks like a bad dreamcast game.
- The well-designed controls are plagued with response time problems.
- Some. Maps. Slow. Down. To. A. Crawl. During. Combat.
- Lots of object clipping and if you're not careful, you'll get stuck under huts or crawlspaces and have to start the ENTIRE level over again (or save point, if you're lucky).
- Prepare to put the controllers down and walk away frequently.  Hide your animals.  You'll want to kick something periodically.  I would suggest a cushion, a bag of dog food, or perhaps the guy that thought bringing this game to market was a good idea.

I may become a game designer or a scientist because I loved designing things from this game franchise in earlier editions. It relieved the niche without a lot of the work.

My main disappointment is EA took out Maxis's main branch NO MAC COMPUTERS or Apple. Maxis was born on macs. Seriously. That's why they're named Maxis.

Without yelling or being mad at the series this series removes 89 consecutive concepts and actually is being called the sims 1 HD because it goes so far back in concepts. The only few things that even remotely allow a 1 star are the streamlined create mode, and the multitasking feature. However, they removed more content then actually put into the game. The open world feature was a great idea it even made the game more fun then the previous versions, yet it was removed because of 'technical issues'. Yes there was 20 minute loading screens if you had add on content but it was worth the wait! Your sims would interact with real people. A open world with several sims. But wait for almost anything you have those 30 second loading screens which add up. ""oh you forgot an object 30 second loading screen"". 30 second loading screen.

EA's attitude against the fans is almost brutal. I'm really disappointed. If they give a few free expansions that may not entirely fix the problem. I believe they should recall the game, and apologize. Save Face EA. People are steps away from not buying ANY of your content. This was the one franchise I actually bought from EA. Now you are saying $500 dollars later I have a finished product with DLC and expansions? I think there should be a law preventing people from doing this sort of junk. It's almost fraud.

How can I trust EA that Dragon Age will even live up to it's expectations? The co-founder is having Tax issues as of yesterday and even may file bankruptcy. It seems like the founders' only really care about their lifestyles and not the corporations themselves. So Please I cannot recommend this game at all.

Did this game have potential? Absolutely. It had massive potential. The characters look nice and cartoon-like, there are more than 8, and you could play online at one point. But what is a game if the game play is less than sub-par?

The amount of content in this game is extremely lacking. You can win a few new characters but that's about it. There is a challenge mode but you must beat 22 people in 250 seconds. Those 2 things are your main things you can do in this game. As far as characters, you start out with Ken, Ryu, Bison, Sagat, Zangief, and Balrog... I mean who else does anyone care about in the SF universe enough to buy a game just to play them?

The fighting is somewhat fun but it has so many flaws it is ridiculous. The CPU you fight has what I like to term Metaknowledge where you can be inputting your Haduken buttons and already the computer is lifting up, coming down with an attack to dodge your fire ball and hit you in a combo that takes half of your life.

When you jump to kick someone, they can break from anything they are doing (anything) no matter how complex and stop to hit you out of the air because their timing is so precise you can't walk up to them, you can't jump to them and come down with an attack, and out of the blue if you are able to get in an attack from jumping it will be blocked, the bottom kick will be blocked, and you will be countered with a grab.

Metaknowledge in video games irks me to no end. The AI can hit you no matter what you are doing but they will dodge and block anything you do. Not only that, they will counter you with a 5 hit combo and top it off with their special move which they seem to charge up much faster than you. Pretty much 15 seconds and you're toast.

My main beef with the game is if you can get past all of the metaknowledge the game has, the last boss battle is against a creature named Seth. He is pretty much like the wooden guy from Tekken in that he is a mix of all characters in one. He can teleport, he can stretch his limbs out, he can shoot things at you, he can and will combo you like crazy. He will do the thing where he stands there until you are JUST at the nanosecond of standing up and he will attack you mercilessly to knock you down in which the cycle will repeat itself. He will counter any inch of a move you make and hit you with about 5-10 hits in each counter. Even on ""Very Easy"" he is still a struggle. So much so that there are videos online showing how you can turn the game on the easiest mode just to beat him.

Is that really how you want to remember a street fighter game? Where God willing you make it to the last boss you need to have it on the easiest mode you can have it on just to be able to stand a chance? So you have unenjoyable and frustrating fighting, a major lack of content, and a lack of reason to play as you will just be trolled like some bad joke the developers threw in for a final boss fight no matter what character you are playing with.

Virtually, with the lack of content and horrid game play, the only thing I commend this game on is its graphics...which is not enough to get me to play it because I'm here for game play.

When you have to put a whole clip in a character to kill them and it only takes one hit for you to die it makes acomplishing your missions against infinitly respawning NPCs 8 on 1virtually impossible. Especially when acomplishing that mission means you cant us a gun like durring ""hacking"" missions. I expect more from Bethesda Softworks.

The game installed fine - I was able to quickly log in and start playing, first on my MacBook then on my PC. So the game does work, but this is basically the only good thing about it. For the next few days I have created few cities, fully grown, with full coverage by police/fire department, without any major traffic problems, with a well-working Electronics industry being fed by my recycling plants, never-ending water supply (yes, sewage treatment plants do replenish the waterbed fast enough) and more money income than I was able to spend on anything else.

After you hit that point - there is absolutely nothing else to do. You can't grow the city beyond a tiny pre-defined area, all you can do is help the few neighboring players... if they are still playing the game and did not also quit due to boredom. If not - you can start another city, get it to the same level of economical ""stability"", upgrade/research whatever you are able to (given the tiny limited city area), get bored after a couple of days again. There is absolutely no serious long-term replayability to it, regardless of useless ""multiplayer"" part, all you can hope for are future cosmetic ""DLCs"" adding in few new buildings with new functionalities which you will get bored of after a day or so.

If you still want to try this game out - just wait for some sale or accumulate enough credits from Amazon or whomever so the game would not cost you more than ten dollars or so. Even then I suggest not buying it until EA will finally increase in-game city areas several times of their current size. Meanwhile I suggest finding a similar type of ""city simulation"" game on your smartphone/tablet device - there are few of those available for both iOS and Android platforms, with longer replayability, better multiplayer features and at no cost to you (no, you do NOT have to buy the in-app currencies for these free games, just be patient!) and more of them will come in future.",Do not buy for full price,1378857600,4,{'Format:': ' Software Download'},

The Razer Naga Epic Chroma was my first Razer mouse. Been using Logitech most of my life. I've been using the G700 for years, but have been playing more and more MMO's and wanted an MMO mouse for the extra buttons. When the Naga Epic Chroma was announced, I was excited to try it out.

Boy was I disappointed. I even went and purchased a G600 for comparison the same day I received my Epic Chroma.

PRO's:

- Feels great in the hand. Feels a little lighter than the G600.
- Love the tactile feedback of the buttons compared to the G600.
- Love the long 20-hour battery life, and that it can be either wired or wireless. Also like the included charging dock as well. The G600 is only wired (sad face).

CON's:

- The Naga Epic Chroma doesn't have a ""G-Shift"" button for accessing a second set of programmed buttons like the G600. Meaning that while holding down the G-Shift button, all other buttons can be programmed for a second task. Meaning the 12 buttons on the side can be turned into a 24-button keypad.

THE DEALBREAKER:

- The dealbreaker for me, and the reason for sending the mouse back is that even though I have mouse acceleration turned off in Synapse (Razer Software) and in Control Panel, the mouse still exhibits acceleration. More research found that most Razer mice have ""Dynamic DPI Scaling"" which cannot be disabled.

What this ""Dynamic DPI Scaling"" does is when you make slower mouse movements, it turns the DPI down so you actually have to move the mouse more than normal. I've always had a 1:1 mouse movement with all previous mice, but Razer mice cannot have 1:1 movement when they keep forcing ""Dynamic DPI Scaling"" with no option to disable it.

A quick Google search of ""Razer Dynamic DPI Scaling"" will return many results, and also show that Razer has been contacted numerous times over the years to give us an option to disable it. They have yet to comply with a very simple request.

Forced acceleration.... if it weren't for that, I'd be keeping the mouse since I love just about every other aspect of it. So, if you don't think you can handle forced acceleration, you may want to take a pass on Razer products.

I'll be sticking with the G600 for the foreseeable future...","Almost perfect, but one terrible (and on-going) flaw that makes it a dealbreaker...",1417824000,3,{'Style:': ' Naga Epic Chroma'},

Personally, I credit this to inability or unwillingness on the part of the game developers/operators (NCWest) to

  1. Balance the two races such that meaningful PvP can occur.  As it stands now, being an Asmodian is a constant series of losing battles where you are outnumbered at least 2 to 1.  I would imagine that some might enjoy being on the other side (the Elyos) and slaughtering other players with no effort, but such is not for me.

  2. Bots (characters controlled by software, with no one actually at the keyboard) are rampant, almost completely uncontrolled by GM's (Game Masters), simply because there is very little GM presence in the game.  I suspect that since GM's need to be paid at least some salary, their numbers are kept low.

  3. Kinah (game money) sellers (usually closely aligned with bots) not only broadcast in the chat channels, and send you private messages, they camp right in front of the brokers.  Again, GM enforcement of the rules against this is almost nil, which causes any respect for the other rules (Terms of Service) to evaporate.

  4. The logic for gaining XP (Experience Points, which drive the advancement of your character) is such that, at least in the general player opinion, grouping with other players is actually detrimental.  Almost everyone solos.  Expect a lonely first few weeks of play, until you have achieved the crucial level 25, at which point grouping becomes more necessary to survival.

  5. Last, but not least, the chat channels (especially the critical LFG (Looking For Group)) have been taken over, generally, as a teen chat channel, full of obscenities, racism, anti-semitism, and references to illicit substances and adult activities.  Yet again, no GM oversight.  I have encountered some mature, reasonable people in groups, but not many.  I do not recommend that parents permit children under 18 to play this game.

Sadly, this game takes your $60 and then won't actually allow you into a lobby to play multiplayer with your friends. My daughter waited feverishly for this game since the day it was announced. We got it, patched and installed it, and then tried to play on line. And waited. And waited. And waited . . .

I felt pretty bad watching her excitement and anticipation turn to dread. On average, she waits about 30 minutes for match-making to work and a game to start. She plays, the match ends, and then she waits another 30 minutes. This makes the botched EA launch of BF 4 look like a perfectly designed Swiss watch by comparison.

As of yesterday, when 343 officially apologized, the estimate for another patch was still several weeks away. Don't get your hopes up, because the last patch that was supposed to fix the game only crippled it further. 343 can claim ""unexpected issues"" all they want, but we all know there is no excuse for this kind of launch but apathy, cost-cutting, and zero quality control. Anticipated profits  and holiday sales numbers clearly ruled the day when the decision was made to release an unfinished product. What a shame.

Better connectivity but some player lists (e.g., Halo 4) remain removed from multiplayer. So, still not getting what I paid for . . .

Now I'd like to call my-self a Total War fan, however I've only played Rome: Total War and Medevial II: Total War and I was verry impressed. and so with that in-mind I decided to buy Empire: Total War...after four hours dealing with the picky Steam player I was finally under-way to install the actuall game. which yes I must admitt that the flaming hoops I had to jump through just to get Steam on my system was a HUGE turn-off but it had nothing to do with the Games review that I'm about to get to. if you want to hear what I think of this 'Revolutionary' Steam product scroll down this review to the bottom page.

After dealing with that I hit the play button... and then I had to wait for Steams ""Updates"" wich took forever.

after that! I was finally under-way playing Empire: Total War. The battle map is a little bit better looking than Medeivel 2 TW(Total War) but will make your computer (if it is an older model, or clutterd) run slower than cold malasis going up-hill. but eventually I was under-way in a land battle, visually satisfactory, nothing really remarkable about it. However the AI in this game is terribly stupid, I play as the general I'll win the battle and get a 'Heroic Victory' I let the AI take over and I loose, even if I have a huge competant army.

the Total War Empire has hit a HUGE bump in the road with Empire: Total War. can it come back? absolutly and I sure hope they do, maybe with a Rome II: Total War the best of the games I've played so far. and another downer with Empire: Total War is there is no EmpireTotalWarShell so you connot bulster your cities that way or gain money that way, you have to grit and bare this difficult game out the old fashion way. which there's not proberlem with that, it's the most relistic way. but I do miss being the richest and most advanced faction in the Empire...

And this game bring the use of 'technology' and takes away all the more control you used to have over an TW empire. you get your special people (Preist, gentlement(technologist) and Rakes (assisnis)) when the game decides you can have one, which will lead to endless revolts and possible the toppelling of your nation. the Technology is gained by your gentlement that have to have an college to even get started, the technology is gain by turn and will take you the entire length of the game to succesfully complete.

Towards the Sea!
The game has much hype surround by it's fact that you now can control your ships on the battle-field. the ships are gorgeous looking, but the actuall gameplay of naval battle is cumbersome and will take ages to win, exspecially when you try to finish off your routing ememies ship... as you chase their ship accros the atlantic...

Steam The Worst Thing To Hit The Gaming Industry...
Steam is well I believe a anti-piracy system that personalizes the game you bought to you with a username password system that tailors that game to you and to you alone. so no more lending a game to you freind (which is a form of Piracy). and it suger coats the bad medicine you'll have to swallow with Steam by the intriquing idea of you can play that game from any computer. so like if your computer crashes and erases everything from you computer you won't have a hassel trying to install that game back into your computer. however the Steam system is a free download or it can be inloaded by the game that has to have it. and yes in order to play Empire: Total War you HAVE to have Stem in your computer or you can forget about it. however Steam is NOT easy to work with, so exspect a hassel trying to install Steam into your computer.
Steam is a good idea with a bad uneasy to use system. however somthing dose have to be done to curb the rising piracy attackts on industries just like Total War. Total War proberly lost hundres of thousand, if not millions, to piracy in proberly one installment of Total War, let alone the other games of Total War. like I said Steam has a good cause but not easy to work with...

1.0,True,"11 12, 2013",A3TI2FTZN3YJV2,B00EEMLMW0,magis123,"Wow, I cannot believe I got duped into buying this game.  I watched all the preview videos, bought into the hype that Activision & Infinity Ward spun around this game; only to find out that when you got it, it looks NOTHING like any of the videos they have shown.  I have purchased the Hardened Edition for the PS4 (and I have a pre-launch PS4 to play it on), the regular version for the PS3 and the regular version for the PC; so I have quite a breadth of experience here playing the game already.

Let's get down to it, the game is just bad.  It really is more of a beta than a final release product and if you contact Infinity Ward or Activision customer support about it, the representatives there will tell you that very thing.  I have heard from several different levels of support today [after spending nearly 6 hours on the phone with support] that we just have to 'bear with them, the product needs just a little tweaking and it will be perfect'.  Seriously?!  The game which you released needs tweaking?!  The connection is completely unstable [dedicated servers?  I do not think so] on the multiplayer facet that you get logged out after only a couple games, that or it locks up your system.

HACKERS -- that is right on day one of the release of this game it was already hacked.  Infinity Ward knew about this two months ago because there was a Chinese site that had posted the entire code for the game for people to start hacking, but they did nothing about it.  And the in game reporting system?  It is the biggest joke there is.  All the multiplayer leaderboards show ridiculous statistics that are clearly hacking, but is anything being done about it?  No.  I have followed specifically 10 people that I reported for hacking on day 1 of release; nothing has been done to them or their account and they just continue to hack away.  Oh and the hackers are on ALL platforms, PS4 included (I am assuming XBONE but I do not know anyone with a pre-launch XBONE).

NETWORK USAGE - When playing online, normal games use about 10-20 KB/sec of data usage (this is what I average playing either MW3 or BO2 or even currently BF4) ... on average I am seeing ranges from 65-100 KB/sec of usage with this game.  So 5x the normal usage with this game.  What could that mean?  Number one it seriously heats up your system, and number two if you have bandwidth caps with your provider, it will be 5x more likely for you to hit them and get overage charges.

HARDWARE USAGE - (THIS RELATES TO THE PS3 VERSION ONLY, I DO NOT HAVE SENSORS ON MY PS4) - CPU Usage on the PS3 consistently spikes to 100% and stays there for extended times, longest time at 100% was for a full 35 minutes.  Just imagine that amount of usage.  After playing Ghosts for ~25+ minutes, the CPU core temperatures on the PS3 go to 90*C (194*F) on average, I have seen temp spikes in the excess of 115*C (239*F)  RAM usage, when playing the game there is never less than 100% of the PS3 RAM being used.  How this affects the game or system is that if god forbid someone sends you a message or game invite, you run the risk of disconnecting from the PSN servers because simply put the system cannot handle it.  Also if you do not clean out your Inbox and Sent Box which are stored in the temporary RAM on your PS3, you also run the risk of the game locking up.  The Blu-ray drive runs almost constantly.  I have never had a game that ran the Blu-ray drive this much.  Blu-ray drive temperatures are running between 65*C (149*F) and 85*C (185*F).  This will cause premature failure of the drive, which could be a very brilliant product strategy if that is what Sony wants (product failure means you would probably go out and buy a new unit).

And this is a darn abominable shame, because the game itself is actually a lot of fun.

First of all, the game loves to crash on me when I least expect it.  When I visit Beast/Forge's shop and choose the ""see equipment"" option, the game will sometimes kick me out to the title screen!  And if I haven't saved my game in the last 5 seconds, bye-bye unsaved progress!  The same thing tends to happen when I'm using the Danger Room computer, or using an Xtraction Point to change my team: the screen will go black, and I'll find myself back at the title screen.

The Hero Stash is another source of frustration.  You're allowed to keep up to 60 things in there, but I've discovered that anytime I exceeded 15, all the equipment from Beast/Forge's shop that was for sale would just vanish.  That's right; Beast/Forge would suddenly just stop selling stuff to you (except for potions and the Grab Bag), and I could not get the shop to start offering stuff again, even after I got rid of some stuff from the Hero Stash.

Also, you probably noticed that defeated enemies and breakable objects often cough up tech bits and, more rarely, armor and equipment.  I've noticed that all this stops right around the end of Chapter 2: I can't get any money (tech bits) from that point on, no matter how many enemies I beat!  How the HECK am I supposed to buy potions and armor and equipment without any money?

All these bugs have screwed up my save data permanently several times already, and I've had to start the game over from the beginning each time, hoping that I can do something differently each time to avoid the bugs, but no such luck.  Frankly, I'm now sick of trying.

What was Raven Software doing with this game???  Did they even have a Quality Assurance department?  Hey Raven, you guys NEED to come out with X Men Legends 3, and you NEED to address the bugs.

Every hour or 2 of gameplay would result in the game either lagging to single digit framerate to the point where the game was unplayable and the only way to fix it was quitting out through the menu, or completely freezing up and having to hard reset the PS3. I've probably reset and quit out of the game roughly 50 times in the week it took me to beat the main game's story. Then you have the DLC's, and the only one I had luck with was Old World Blues where the game only froze on me 2 times, but 2 of the other DLC's had the same freezing issues, if not worse than the main game, in one of the DLCs I had the game freeze every 30 minutes. Then you have the horrible DLC that breaks the game, Lonesome Road, once you get outside about an hour into the DLC it lags horribly and freezes only after a few minutes of playing, I've literally had the game freeze after playing for only 2 minutes of that DLC. I think I'm going to just give up, the game was horribly optimized for this console and to be honest the game isn't that great anyway, but if you must play it get it on 360 or an optimized PC, and if you must play it on PS3 get the regular edition and install all the DLC separately. I played Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Skyrim all on PS3 and put 100s of hours into those games combine, beat almost all the content and side material, and even went through Shivering Isles on Oblivion. I only had maybe a handful of issues on those games compared to this version of New Vegas, and I can count Skyrim only freezing up on me a handful of times, and even Oblivion and Fallout 3 which were plagued with issues and freezing probably only froze a quarter the amount of times this game did total and I played those games probably double or triple the amount of time I played this.

 I could have maybe forgiven the game if it only froze 10 times the whole experience and if all the DLC ran smooth with no issues, but the only thing in the game that ran somewhat smooth for me was Old World Blues and that may have just been out of luck, the game is a buggy mess and becomes more frustrating than fun when you have to either quit out or turn off your system after every hour or so because the game freezes and lags, and the fact that there is an entire DLC on this that is practically unplayable is unacceptable and Bethesda should be ashamed of this port, and the people who tested this and gave it the green light should feel ashamed of themselves. Clearly this port didn't have the PS3's specs in mind so they tried to cut corners and wing it, and as a result we got a buggy port that can barely run for more than an hour at time before encountering an issue. And anyone who gave this more than 3 stars probably never played this version and are rating the core game, which itself would be around 4 stars, that or they didn't play for more than 10-15 hours when the big issues start popping up, because I bet if they went into Lonesome Road this game would have a much lower rating average. I'm not even really a huge PC gamer, but for this game, PC is the best experience and way to go if you want the least issues.","Please don't buy this, this version is practically unplayable and one DLC is broken",1505606400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

- Short story mode that also serves as a basic tutorial.  If you've ever played Dead or Alive: Dimensions for the 3ds, it's the same thing.

Most of the fights happen for the dumbest reasons and just serve as filler.

- No character endings in arcade mode. It's been turned into a ""Get the highest score"" mode and there's not even a boss at the end.

Dead or Alive 5 is a 4.9 gig disc, there's no reason why they couldn't put endings in it. I didn't think Team Ninja would mess this up so bad and it really hurts replay value.

- Lack of content. There's 3 characters from the Virtua Fighter series to unlock via Story Mode. Other than that, there's some costumes for each character that you unlock by beating the various modes with a character and on different difficulties.  Most costumes can be gotten by playing the easier settings except for Lei Fangs.

- It requires an Online Pass to play online. With a fighter so lacking in content, you think they'd let this slide.

Now, onto the positives:

- The fighting is fluid and mostly unchanged except for new moves like Cliffhangers and Power blows. They allow you to interact with the things in the environment to harm your opponent.  For example, you can toss them against an exploding barrel or cause a rooftop to collapse.

- The added dirt and sweat effects are a nice touch.

I do get some scores, some hits, but so often I over react to a sudden appearance of someone around a corner and end up shooting the clouds or the ground.

I had a difficult time to get it setup, but it seemed like it was going to work. I then read through the instructions and saw that only wired keyboards and mice are usable. The stores are getting very lean on the wired versions of keyboards and mice. I found a mouse. The system actually works fine with a wireless keyboard. The wired mouse does not work though.

I got the Xbox because my friend has a team to work with. We use the chat capability constantly to direct the team where needed. This system has no provision for the headset.

I plan to fiddle around with it, visit the forum if there is one and see what I had done wrong. I will also see if I can find a list of devices that it does work with. It has a great potential for me, so I am going to keep trying.

At this point it only gets one star. I may be able to update this in the future, I will give it an honest effort.

Unfortunately EA sports has not made any improvements to the game, but they have also ruined it by trying to make it more realistic(!). I'm not complaining because I can't win ,I just won my season one championship last week so I know how to play. The point is that FIFA 14 is not fun anymore...

What EA has failed to understand is that video games are meant to be fun. when you attempt to make a game realistic (in your own thoughts), you should consider the fact that it must not spoil the fun. As you can read in other reviews there are many many many issues that happen way too often in a game which makes you want to break your game. Just to mention a few:

- super sluggish game-play and increased momentum of players
- Easy cross and header goals that happen way too much in every game (Trust me, I also score most of my goals this way)
- Dribbling with the best players in the world is almost impossible because of super late reactions and movements
- Lofted through balls (which was so bad in the beginning that EA released a patch to fix it in the first few weeks)
- Unrealistic first touch controls (sometimes players like Messi seem to have no idea how to stop an easy pass)
- Ridiculously foolish team-mates (some things are totally out of your control...)
- Forwards are in offside position 90% of the time (and don't seem to care at all!)
_ Throw-ins are just a joke! Players spend most of the time running after the ball themselves as if there's no one out there

Overall, after a game (specially at higher levels) you don't feel like you won the game because you're good. Instead you feel like you only won because you were lucky. That's what kills the fun in a sports game.

After all, it's EA and they sure know how to be the winner of ""Worst Company of the Year"" for 2 years in a row. If you haven't purchased the game yet, don't buy it. It's just a waste of time and money...",One of the wors FIFA games ever,1383350400,18,,

1.0,False,"06 6, 2005",AR0THZ6HEVW4V,B0008EZDDM,Amazon Customer,"This was a decent game at one time.  There were a slew of bugs, and there was a lot of boring stuff to deal with, but there was something unique about it all.  It was just amazing fun.  The breadth of the planets, the professions, the experiences was great.  It may also have been what killed SWG.  The developers never seemed all that competent, and were certainly badly understaffed.  But it was still a great community, and I had a lot of fun, playing every night for a year.

Now, I can't stand the ground game.  One of the things that made SWG so unique was the real focus on non-combat characters.  You could make money, have fun, talk with friends, and spend all your time working in a variety of professions without killing anything.  You were an important part of the SWG world.  Combat classes were a little stale and repetitive, but after s few weeks of grinding, you could defend yourself against most things and engage in the high-end content, which was survivable with a group.

Now, combat classes have been all screwed up.  Some sort of weird, arbitrary system has been imposed that looks more like Magic:The Gathering cards than the multi-profession blends we had before.  In other words, if you are Class A, you can defeat Creature B and C, but not D.  You have to be Class E to kill Creature D, but Creatures B and C can easily kill you.  It's stupid.  And unless you are a Bounty Hunter or Rifleman, your goose is pretty much cooked if you try to solo - which you will, because the servers are so dead now there is no one to group with some nights.

And the non-combat classes?  Completely wrecked.  Doctors had a number of roles.  True, they had become glorified buff-bots, but that was just a balance issue, buffs were too strong.  Instead of a minor fix, WHAM! down comes the nerf-hammer and doctors are useless, except in combat, where they are dead ducks unless they also take the time to grind out a combat class or two.  Entertainers?  The devs couldn't think up anything good for them, so they became true AFK buff-bots.  Rather than tweak that system, WHAM they are useless now.  Crafters?  Absolutely vital to the economy.  Someone has to make all this junk that gets used.  Instead of doing a little tweaking to armor and guns, making them gated like spaceships are, and some other things, WHAM!.  They still craft, though a lot of their goods and resources are now useless, costing millions of credits, but the CU has had the (I am sure) UNEXPECTED effect of making them as helpless as babies outside their doors, where they have to go to collect resources.  So now, instead of a crafter specializing in a couple of crafting branches for variety and more fun, they can only do one branch, and must grind a few combat roles just so they can go to their mineral resource collector without getting killed by a pack of wild rabbits.

Consequently, people playing crafters are gone.  Doctors are gone.  Entertainers are gone.  Even some combat roles that got seriously nerfed, like Teras Kasi, are gone.  Smugglers and Creature Handlers and Bio-Engineers have been long gone.  There will be nothing but Bounty Hunters and Riflemen and Jedis soon.  And the Jedis really got borked in the CU as well.  They are extremely weak early, yet must make themselves very visible - and with all the BH classes, they don't last for a day.  So Jedis will leave.  Then BH's have no targets.  Will it be a Rifleman's Galaxy when all is said and done?

The only thing that kept me in so far, and I have cancelled my account, it runs out in 2 days, is Jump to Lightspeed.  The missions are boring, unrealistic and repetitive, the AI is dull and simplistic, the ship movement is slow and kludgy, and the physics are astoundingly bad, even for a reasonably intelligent high school grad.  But it's still fun to fly around with a few mates and blow things up.  And the multi-player ships are cool.  Completely useless and unplayable in any sense, but still a cool idea.

And that is the moral of my long story: Star Wars Galaxies was (and is, if LA will fire SOE and make SWG II) a great idea, with lots of cool, original and unique ideas tried in a halting fashion.  But so much was poorly designed, badly implemented, untested, and never fixed correctly.  The entire emphasis of the dev team has been on maximizing short-term profits, by working on expansion packs instead of fixing issues, by adding inane graphical geegaws instead of fixing issues, and by ignoring the customers.  The result has become, over 20 months, an unplayable mess.

If you want good role-playing alternatives, some people say Everquest II or World of Warcraft, though friends tell me the bloom is off those titles as well, and EQ II seems to be on the same path as SWG.  If you want space-based action and an interesting economy, try EVE Online, which is where I have switched my money.  It's complicated and starts a little slow, but the graphics are astounding, the gameplay deep, and the dev team very interactive with the customer fanbase.",This game is dead,1118016000,20,,

After all, in the late 80's early 90's I really enjoyed this game.  It was really something to have.  Years later it's apparent of two things: The game was horribly designed, and it CAN'T stand the test of time.  The fact that on Nintendo's VC it's also a dollar more than the other NES games is also questioning.  It's hard to make a game this bad.

If you were a fan of the Turtles a long time ago back in the early 90's the first thing you'll notice about the game is that it hardly has anything to do with the show at all outside of some of the major characters.  Outside of that there are no foot soldiers, and most of the enemies you encounter you never saw in the show in the first place.  You will come across Bebop and Rocksteady but none of the other enemies were actually ever in the show in the first place.  Kind of daunting.

What really makes the game horrible, however, lies within the gameplay.  Firstly, the turtles themselves are unbalanced and put to unfair use.  You can switch between any of the turtles at a time, but for the most part, only one of them is of any use to getting you through the adventure.  Michaelangelo and Raphael are completely useless, as their weapons lack to the range to actually do anything.  Leonardo is alright, but Donatello is the only real useful one here, as he's the only one who can attack downward and at a range.  More than likely you'll only want to use the other three to sacrifice so that Donatello can do some beating up on enemies.

The way the levels are designed is also horrendous.  You basically walk around an overworld map and go into sewers, warehouses and whatnot.  The problem is that you never know where to go next.  This non-linear style wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many blasted dead ends.  To make the experience even more grueling, the game is just FULL of enemies that will respawn almost the second you turn around.  You could go through a tough warehouse fighting tons of tough enemies, only to find you can't go any further.  So now you'll have to backtrack and you may have to fight all those enemies again.  So if you don't lose a turtle getting to a dead end, you'll probably lose him getting from it.

The game isn't really difficult, it's just unfair and frustrating.  The fact that two of your four players are completely useless tells you something.  The later turtles games were far better than this.  Skip the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.  It's so unfair that the experience is frustrating.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II and III were far better, and there's still no turtles game that beats the all time best: Turtles IV: Turtles in Time.  If you need a classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fix, the first Turtles game on the NES isn't going to do it.",A Horribly Designed Game,1176422400,5,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo NES'},

Everyone who bought it, including me was shocked. Did Sega forget that a great baseball video game is more than just graphics? When I got this game along with NBA 2K1 and NFL 2K1 I was amazed by the graphics. Preston Wilson looked, batted and threw exactly like he actually does and the stadiums were just breathtaking.
I couldn't wait to get into the game so I did an exhibition game. I was stunned! There was no maual-fielding option, hitting was nearly impossible and getting through an inning without getting shelled was just as hard. I played this game for about 10 minutes trying to figure out if it was just me that I was so bad and that there was no manual-fielding, but I realized that's the way the game is. After playing once or maybe twice I put this game away for good then traded it in along with a few other games for Sonic Adventure 2 and Soul Calibur. That's probably the best move I ever had made.

The good:

Interesting character creation
Combat is fun, snappy, and responsive (But is mouse targeting REALLY different than hitting tab?)
Gorgeous world.

The bad:

Elitist playerbase.
GvG (It's fun hunting a level 1 guild leader..)
The empty world
The quest system (ENJOY GRINDING JUST LIKE AION!)
Elin race of little girls, that you frequently hear /local talking about in a profane manner.
and much, MUCH more.

TERA falls flat on it's face after getting out of the gates, the combat is very fun (Until you are killing your 8348234th monster using the same tactics as the previous 8348233). Big ass monsters are fun, and require strategy (However, this is very easy and the game boils down to how good a tank can tank, a healer can heal, and a dps can keep up dps.) The game sticks with the ""holy trinity"" of Tank, heals, dps and ensures a continued stagnation of the MMO genre.

Most of what I've played in TERA (All CBTs, 2 months since release)hasn't been all bad, I had fun leveling somewhat (the grind sucks).

THERE IS NO REAL ENDGAME! Unless you really enjoy doing the same 8 dungeons with HORRIBLE groups (unless you're in a guild, or better yet the popularity contest winning Vanarchy guild that controls a region) Ganking lowbies, spouting rubbish into the chat system, and generally being completely annoying when a new player asks a question is key with the playerbase here.

EDIT: EME has made some changes to the US TERA recently and are releasing PVP battlegrounds shortly. The GVG kill swapping has been stopped (lol) and new things are on the horizon, however these are too little and too late for this player. I just wish they'd stop sending me emails every 3 days about their game that I no longer have a desire to play. A current glance at how the game is doing in Korea is a direct indication of how the future of TERA in the west will be. 4 servers left, and nothing but cash shop items and little to no end game content.

Stronghold began as a rebellion by the guys who created the Lords series, and were being forced out of their own company and forced to make something they didn't want to.  And so Stronghold was made, and it was a winner of a game.  A good medieval theme with combat and economic aspects.

Then Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Legends and all the others kept this basic design.  And mostly showed a fun, somewhat light hearted, game.  But this game has no freebuild, very poor campaigns, is moody and dark, has no missions or addons or any of the other aspects that made the Stronghold series a strong chain of games.

Update: The Sega forums suggest some solutions to the glitchy scenarios which you might want to try. The following is a list of keyboard controls which is different from (and more complete) than the game manual. HTH:

S Move Left
D Move Right

2 Armor Energy
3 Weapon Energy
4 Even Energy

Left Alt: Afterburner flight

The game starts off nicely enough with a ""bash through the tunnels and kill the bad guys"" scenario. Simplistic controls, dated graphics but not bad either. Second scenario is flight and weapons testing, an overly long tutorial as you learn the basics of flight and weapons with the suit. Not bad either but then the scenario doesn't end, you can't get out of the warehouse/target range to move on to the next scenario.

It must've been one of those deals where someone was selling an NES with games set at a garage sale, and well...it happened to be in there. Or at least I would hope that is what the case is, otherwise, I'd really need to figure out what posessed me to buy this stinker, and neutralize it before it ever makes me do such a thing, again! The idea of Ring King is simple: You are a boxer, and you fight other boxers on your way to becoming a champion. Actually attaining that goal is not so simple. Unfortunately, it's more due to horrible play control and gameplay than challenging fights.

At first glance, the quality of Ring King's graphics may not seem too bad, especially for an NES title as early as 1987. The problem is that every single boxer looks exactly the same! The only difference is that they swap palettes, and some of the palette swaps are downright terrible! What is up with this guy wearing hot pink shorts with matching gloves and shoes?! A boxer with a farmer's tan and a bright white afro? They look a little ""wimpy"" for boxers, too. The animation is usually done with two frames, which makes it almost impossible to see a punch coming to block or dodge it, causing Ring King to become one big guessing game as to when you should dodge and when you should attack. The audience is the only other factor in the graphics, and it looks like the standard ""audience"" you would see in NES sports titles: colorful little dots, some with faces, some without.

The music and sound effects of Ring King are far below the best efforts on the Atari 2600. Let's start with the ""music"". There are these little jingles that play on the title screen and between rounds, but they sound really lame and add nothing to the game's overall sound. There's a beeping noise that plays the whole time you're in the ring, and this is supposed to be music. The sound effects are no better. The sound of the bell is very unrealistic (compare it to the bell sound in Punch-Out!!, if you will.) When you swing a punch, the ""swishing"" noise sounds like something ripping. When you connect with a punch, it sounds like something made of metal splashing into water. The ref has a voice, but if I didn't know he was saying ""Fight"" or counting to ten, it would be impossible to tell what he is saying, as he sounds more like a barking dog. There is no ""roar of the crowd"" as in other NES sports games, either.

Well, Ring King takes a swing, but ends up hitting way below the belt! The play control is the whole reason I find this game so putrid. The sound being bad is one thing. If I enjoy the gameplay, I can always turn off the volume and crank up my stereo. But no matter how loudly I play my favorite classic rock tunes, it won't fix bad play control. First of all, it really annoys me how limited your movement is in this game. I've heard that this game is ""more realistic"" than Punch-Out!! because you can move around the whole ring. I'm sorry, but it just doesn't seem to work out that way. You may have the whole ring open to you, but you can only move in circles around your opponent. For example, if you're standing to the left of your opponent, and you push Up on the controller, you will move around to the top, so that he's standing below you on the screen. But the boxer moves really slowly, and you cannot do anything else until he stops moving. You can't swing a punch, you can't dodge, you can't move in another direction. So what was supposed to be more realistic moving and dodging ends up being you and your opponent doing figure 8's around each other all across the ring! When you try to throw a punch, there is a definite delay between the time you press the button and when your boxer actually swings! That is...if he even swings at all! Sometimes he'll duck or dodge, and other times he won't respond at all. So, basically, I spend the whole game mashing buttons, hoping that my boxer will do the right damn move at the right damn time!!

The only real story behind Ring King is that you are a boxer trying to become a champion. The problem is that the game lacks atmosphere. All the boxers look exactly alike, so you never feel like you're fighting anyone special. Ring King also has no ending...you beat the last fighter and start over again from the beginning. The only reason I can think to even score this above a 1 is because of the rather hilarious and, um, infamous between-round antics.

Ring King is quite hard, but hard does not necessarily = challenging. To me, the true meaning of ""challenge"" in a videogame, is when your skills are tested, and you are given room to improve. It is not button mashing, hoping for results! One unique aspect of this game is that your boxer earns ""experience points"" as he fights and wins matches. You can then allocate these points to his stats, to make him more powerful for later fights. But this has the counterproductive effect of making the game get easier as you go along. Just getting past the first couple of boxers is extremely difficult, and I usually only just barely get by. I'm not saying games should be easy, but the purpose of the first fight of the game should be to get you used to the play control, play mechanics, to learn the moves, and to be able to experiment with different techniques. Most of the times, I can't even beat the guy in the training gym! Maybe it's my impatience. Maybe if this game had more responsive play control, I'd be more inclined to try to learn the moves. But it still wouldn't be much fun fighting a bunch of boxers who all look alike and all have the exact same moves.

Seeing as how Ring King was originally a Namco game (one of my favorite game companies), I really wanted to like it. But I'm just totally unable to have fun with it. It can't just be because I don't care much for boxing, seeing as how I loved Punch-Out!!. I think it's more because this game just plain sucks! Whenever I turn it on, I can barely play it for more than 30 seconds before the frustration and hatred set in, and I have to shut it off. There are several different play modes, but they all seem alike to me. You can customize your boxer in one mode, but what difference does it make, since he'll still look the same as all the other boxers, and he'll still have the same moves? There is also a mode where you can just watch computer-controlled matches, and sadly enough, this game is actually more fun to watch than to try playing.

All in all, Ring King certainly does not come up a winner. Even without Punch-Out!! to compare it to, this game would still be quite bad. If you're a fan of the arcade version, or really like boxing games, then maybe you might find something to like here. Otherwise, avoid and move on.","If you're a fan of the arcade version, or really like boxing games, then maybe you might find something to like here.",1432339200,,,
1.0,False,"07 1, 2002",A1EE8EZLR8LJ9M,B0000631WE,Stephen Morrison Lewis,"Fans of the N64 wrestling game series waited long for a next-gen successor to take Nintendo to the next level of sports entertainement.  They will have to keep waiting.
Wrestlemania X8 sports what feels very much like Smackdown,  but lacks many of the features the Smackdown series made it big for.  The Create a Wrestler (CAW) system,  while creating smooth wrestlers,  is very limited.  Here's a rundown:
Graphics:  The graphics are great in some places,  but are inconsistant.  While some wreslters look very much like their counterparts,  many don't.  The movements onscreen are rather jerky and don't quite line up.  It's a step up from previous Nintendo platform games,  but nothing for a next gen system.
Sound:  The only complaint I've come up with so far,  from myself or others is that the levels are a bit low.  If cranking your stereo or TV up a couple of notches is the only problem,  you're pretty much standing on solid ground.  The sound does indeed need some extra volume,  but is otherwise excellent.
Controls:  The controls are clumsy and unintuitive.  While they're not impossible to manage,  many commands double for mulptiple things you might attempt to do in the same circumstances.  The instruction manual is horribly organized for attempting to find what buttons you hit to perform what.
Gameplay:  Well,  this is what matters in a wrestling game.  Controls,  as mentioned above,  are unintuitive,  but responsive at the very least.  Timing seems less important in this game,  compared to other titles.
The moveset is incredibly limited.  No Mercy had 16 different grapple moves per wrestler (Counting only front grapples for simplicity in this review),  Smackdown had ten,  WM X8 has 5. The selection of grapple options is pretty limited too.
Pre-release hype pointed to slower,  more realistic gameplay,  and better ""selling"" of moves (Selling refers to taking the move and making it look good).  The gameplay is slower than the mindless funger numbing pound-any-button-and-win frenzy of smackdown,  but win strategies are still pretty limited.  As for the ""sell time,""  expect your opponents to stay down only a little longer after a Twist of Fate or Stone Cold Stunner than if they had been nailed with an Eye rake or Fireman Carry.
The grappling is also a holdover from Smackdown.  What is there of No Mercy in this game,  as we were promised?  Not much.  Attacks to the groin give a ""ding"" sound,  and the countering system uses a foundation based off of No Mercy.  However,  whereas there were dozens of possible counters,  including varied reversals for heavyweights,  light heavyweights,  an martial artists,  there is usually only one reversal to a move,  and most are shared among many,  many moves.  Finishers can be reversed,  however.
Among the good are a wide variety of matches,  every sort of match your little heart could desire,  provided it makes a showing on WWF/E TV.  HEll in a Cell,  Cage,  Tornado Tag,  etc.
To summarize the gameplay,  it plays like a cheesy arcade game.  In the early nineties,  we moved away from this kind of game for just that reason.  It's return is unwelcome,  and its demise will not be mourned.
Create a Wreslter:  Sadly,  the CAW works like the Smackdown series,  without the benefit of all the options.  Selections are limited and hardly sufficient for coming up with a wrestler that is anything more than a hodge podge of the current pop favorites.  The CAW system from Smackdowns 2 and 3 was a huge selling point,  even to people disappointed with the gameplay.  This is but a pale imitation of better systems.
Wrestlemania X8 has remained a fairly big disappointment.  Some will enjoy this title,  but I'd suggest renting it,  even if you are a fan of the Smackdown series and this review has done nothing to sway you.",Smackdown Junior?  Anything but No Mercy's successor,1025481600,3,,

I actually went as far to preorder the Xbox 360 version because I was excited about it. Needless to say, I'm regretting that decision. This year's game is nothing more than a stripped down carbon copy of last year's game. With an emphasis on the ""stripped down"".

Most of the features in this game are identical except for the things they removed. I love to create wrestlers in this game. All of my created wrestlers have created moves & I almost always use custom theme music. For whatever reason 2K decided to remove it. THAT SUCKS! The creative features is what I have loved about the WWE games. To make it even worse, they removed many of the entrance motions that they had in the previous game. WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE at 2K!!??

If you liked the nostalgic factor that WWE 2K14 had, you won't find it here. There are a few classic wrestlers like Ultimate Warrior, Stone Cold Steve Austin, & Sting is a DLC. However, you aren't going to find loads of classic wrestlers that they had in the last game.

I also am not crazy about the 2K Showcase. It only feature two rivalries. One of them is between John Cena & CM Punk & the other is between Shawn Michaels & Triple H. Why not expand beyond that to include other famous rivalries?

I think it is interesting that they included some of the NXT Roster, but the Got NXT mode is hardly enough to keep my interest. It's very similar to the 2K Showcase where it focuses on various NXT wrestlers.

Most of the features that they left in the game is very much like the previous game. If you really have to get this game, whatever you do, wait until the price drops.

Bandai Namco, in a Square-Enix fashion, managed to shred good memories into pieces by changing the battle formula, the main characters, creating time wasting dungeon puzzles and ridiculously hard random enemies.

About the story, it is 2 years after the dawn of the new world after the party in the original game regenerated and reunited the two worlds. However, in good old RPG manner, there were disputes and discrimination in the new world (which they dealt with already with the Desians in the old game) that the world is far from being united. To even make things worst, the original hero Lloyd Irving seemed to have become the biggest villain in this game. When you were thinking ""What the?"" the game introduced the two most annoying main characters in Tales history - Emil and Marta. Emil basically sulk throughout the game and acted like an idiotic coward. Every time he opens his mouth, you just want to fast forward the cut scenes. As for Marta, although she was supposed to have a greater mission, all the things she said in the game seemed to just want to get laid with Emil. It is extremely frustrating when you need to listen to those conversation again and again after each battle without an option to switch of the dialogues at all. Seriously if Bandai Namco wants to pay homage to the original game, might as well just make a sequel with the same cast tell about their after stories. The two main characters are so unlikable that you just couldn't really be bothered to find out what happened to them.

Adding to that was a completely unrewarding battle and party system. The battle system stayed true but now the party only consists of the two main characters with a Pokemon style recruitment system. The thing is if they actually follow the Pokemon or even the Persona formula, it will be a great system. But then it didn't. Monsters fight with you in real time and evolve, but the AI and strategy controls are so limited you basically have no control over them. Unison attacks all look similar with limited variation so you don't really know whether it is a new move until you look at the name of that move. When monster evolved they reduced back to level 1 and lose their skills (which they can acquire later when they level up again). Now cooking became a means to evolve them and increase their stats but then if you already have leveled up monsters it might be best to stay put and just increase their stats instead of evolving them. So eventually it lost the whole purpose of recruiting new monsters because they all join you at level 1 and required substantial ""wait-in-line level up"" before you can deploy them into battles.

Dungeons in Tales of Symphonia are ingenious and yet challenging. In Dawn of the New World, they are just mere existence for extending gameplay without much value adding to the game. You are repeating all the block pushing and button pressing and that's all. So they make it a lot in each dungeon so you can enjoy listening to the same sound effects again and again for two to three hours. Not because they are difficult to solve but they are so large scale that you just need to run around doing similar things again and again. And to make this even more ""challenging"" they have random enemies that can kill all your party in two or three hits. In one of the dungeons, you need to pick up one of the key cards in one of the rooms, but then suddenly they have random enemies that can cause around 700 damage each hit at a point of the game that 3 hits you'll be dead. To make things worse, Bandai Namco took away the easy on the fly character switching system and replaced it with a complicated and user-unfriendly nun-chuck and Wiimote system that you need a PhD to master it freely. So while you are busily trying to heal and revive your characters, you lost control of all your characters instead.

Dawn of the New World has such potential to be a RPG that Wii owners who love the previous Cube game can embrace it whole-heartedly. But changes to the game just make it a very forgettable game that if you are fans of the old game should strictly stay away. Even the cameo appearance of the original cast won't be able to save it cause the game is overrun by level 99 annoying main characters, cheesy dialogue and exhaustive and uninteresting gameplay.","If you can't make a better sequel, don't!",1262304000,11,,

in monetary value. It is priceless considering i could have done literally ANYTHING other than play this mess of a game.
First off, i only bought it on the merit that it is a PS3 exclusive and since i missed out on the early PS3 days, i decided to give it a try despite all the bad reviews.

I'm sad to report that those bad reviews have been incredibly generous to the game. I can't blame the early reviewers because in 2007 when the game originally came out - they were stuck with the motion controls (patch was released to allow analog controls since) and i highly doubt that with such, they were able to beat the first few levels of the game.
Even now in 2014, with the ability to control your dragon with analog sticks, a lot of actions and game mechanics rely on motion controls which you can't avoid using which eventually causes the game to crash and burn on into a rubble of its own problems that are abundant and absolutely ruin the experience.

Story:

Standard affair fantasy world with dragons with forgettable characters (save for the main character Rohn), by-the-numbers plot development, and a cheesy ending (i assume - because i will not waste another second trying to complete this game). Poor man's Lord of the Rings. Substitute the one ring for VOLCANOES (LOL) and you'll see just how every single aspect of this universe is watered down, laughable middle-earth.

Graphics:

For 2007, i have to imagine that the graphics were quite amazing. It was an early HD console game so by today's standards it looks quite rough around the edges. Can't complain too much though as good graphics don't always make a good game.

Controls:

Horrendous. Easily a gamebreaker in this case. I can't imagine paying full price for this when it was new, only to give up 20 minutes in, after finding the game is unplayable. With the new patch, it helps matters a little bit, but the motion stuff is still unavoidable.

Gameplay:

The control paragraph sums it up pretty much but i'd also like to add that the mission design is one of the most ill-advised, badly-executed and schizophrenic affairs i've ever had the displeasure of partaking in. First off, the game often contradicts itself, it can kill you on a whim, it can randomly decide you've failed a mission, the missions are reptitive and you'll very quickly get bored of maniacally tapping on X to make your dragon go faster and square to make your dragon shoot fire/ice. There are some laughable quick-time events as well that don't work half the time. Its a jumbled mess full of baffling design choices that makes you think the developers never made a game before. All in all, it can get intense and interesting but that makes up 10% of the missions you'll partake in with 90% being frustration, regret for buying this game and a huge desire to put the disc in a toaster.

Overall:

Glitchy, buggy, truly horrible experience that probably never went through quality testing.
As a matter of fact, if i ever meet the QA department responsible for this mess, i'll demand reprimands for wasted time and frustration i had to endure playing it.
A true relic and a testament of PS3's horrible start to life almost a decade ago. I'm thankful i missed out on console gaming during that time, otherwise i would have never picked up a controller again.","Horrible, frustrating experience. Would only recommend to my oldest enemies",1387065600,,,

I'm running Windows XP with more than one gigabyte of memory, which (according to the requirements on the box) should be more than enough.  It isn't.  I experienced the worst slow-down in loading times.  Even ""Pets"" wasn't this bad!  To load the game took nearly five minutes.  To load the neighbourhood took another five.  Then it was another couple of minutes to load a lot.  I thought that my custom content was perhaps slowing things down.  So I got rid of all of it.  I didn't notice any difference.  I can't imagine trying to run this expansion pack with the recommended minimum 512 megabytes of RAM.  I'm not sure the game would ever even load.

I took my Sims on two vacations.  For the first, I took a single woman to Twikkii Island.  I noticed how slow it was right away.  With all the other Sims wandering around these vacation lots, there's bound to be a bit of lag.  I had her visit the beach.  It rained and the gameplay grew even slower.  I had her visit some ancient ruins.  The game slowed almost to a stop when she encountered a hot springs (it must've been the steam animation).  It was just too much for my computer.  Plus, each time my Sim walked to another lot, there were more minutes of loading time.

For the second vacation, I took a couple and their child to the mountain vacation destination.  By this time, the loading times were really starting to annoy me.  I only had them visit one other lot, and I made the mistake of having the mother and daughter play on the log roll.  The mother got completely stuck, and I had to look up how to free her using the debugging tool.  A search of the BBS on the official site shows that I am not the only one to experience this problem.

I didn't bother having my Sims visit the Far East destination.  By the time I got my poor glitched family back from their vacation, I'd had enough.

1.0,True,"06 15, 2014",A3SMWBV1QHQ3AA,B004NRN5DU,Chris,"Simply stated: this is the *worst* video game I have *ever* played.

I'm going to qualify that by saying that there's a lot of good stuff in this game. The visuals are nice, the loot is engaging, and most of the enemy models are decent. And once you get the hang of combat, that part of the game becomes enjoyable. And then you turn a corner and there's some ridiculously powerful enemy that is entirely out of place with what you've been facing and it will kill you before you can ask, ""What the !@*# is that thing?""

You die a lot in the game. That actually seems to be a large part of the design: finding increasingly annoying ways to kill the player character. It's incredibly frustrating because you lose all souls (the game's only currency) and any humanity you may have. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you have a chance (read: exactly ONE chance) to regain whatever you lost. If you die again before you make it back to your lost power, you lose it for good and you can only regain whatever you lost this time. Since whatever killed you is likely far too powerful at the moment, this pretty much means that you're pretty much screwed.

It also doesn't help that the souls you lose are incredibly invaluable. They're the games *only* currency. You use them to purchase stuff and you use them to level up. That's right: at any given moment you have exactly one choice with what you can do with the souls you have. You can either use them to level up, or you can use them to buy equipment or upgrade materials. Since you lose your souls A LOT, this makes progress very slow.

And you're completely screwed if you die in a boss fight. Boss fights are typically engaged in some closed off room you can't escape, which means you can't just run in and grab your lost power and run out to fight another day. In order to be able to use what you get back, you have to survive the fight. You can counter-cheat the game by turning off your console the moment you die, before the game has a chance to autosave the fact that it just screwed you over. The next time you play, you get reset back to just before the boss fight. You still die, but your lost power is now outside the boss zone and you can get it back. I don't know why this isn't the default, because it makes the boss fights that much more frustrating.

Bosses are all idiotically large, with massive weapons that can hit from forever away, and they all hit stupid hard. There are some bosses that even randomly explode with area damage just to screw you over even more. There's one boss that wields two massive cleavers that are each as wide as the room he's in, and he can use a two-weapon attack that's unblockable and usually results in instant death. There's another demon boss that's in a basement room which he also fills up, and he uses a massive force wave attack that can't be blocked and kills the player character in two hits or less, and if you manage to get behind him he'll slam his weapon into the ground to cause an explosion that hits the PC *through the boss*. There's a giant wolf boss that carries an even more giant sword in its mouth, moves several times faster than the useless PC, has 4-5x the attack reach, and can even execute a spin move that will hit you twice with enough damage to kill you every time. These are unbelievably frustrating battles that seem to be designed by sadists that hate the entirety of the gaming community.

It's made even worse by the jackassery of the controls. The controller is incredibly unresponsive. Sometimes it can take a full second for the button you just pushed to actually register. A full second is enough time for you to die.

Even you manage to get your attack button pressed early enough, the animations are ridiculous. Want to swing that massive claymore? It'll take a while because you have to recover from swinging it or thrusting or whatever. But what about this light and nimble and supposedly faster scimitar? Nope, still takes a while because... erm... well... OH YEAH! You have to cock your arm first, and THEN you can swing at the enemy!! Most enemies will use the moment between you start an attack and when it should actually connect to start their own attack, which will usually connect first somehow. Even if your attack connects first, it won't interrupt most enemies unless it outright kills them, and their attack will still connect. And then you die. Again.

OK, how about just running away? That'll take a while too, seeing as how the PC has to lumber up to speed, even when unencumbered. And there's no ""sprint"". The jerk just kind of half-ass jogs along. Almost every enemy in the game can move faster, even if you've unequipped everything to lower your weight. Try to run away and they'll just catch up to you and back-attack you with their super-fast attacks that can hit you even when you're fleeing. And then you die. Again.

And if you try to dodge? Woah! It doesn't seem to matter what direction you hold the stick in, sometimes the PC will randomly dodge TOWARD the thing you're trying to get away from. And then you die. Again.

And the camera seems to somehow be a corporeal thing that tethers your character to the world. It will get stuck on various pieces of the environment and will whip around, completely changing the direction your character is facing, even if you've locked onto a target in combat or are trying to walk carefully across some narrow plank in an aerial environment. And then you die. Again.

Sometimes the uber-massive bosses can get between the camera and PC, resulting in the character not being able to move because the *camera* is stuck. This will happen even when you're in a big open space with no physical obstacles, and will prevent you from being able to get away from the boss' massive-damage-dealing attack. And then you die. Again.

I have NO idea how this game made it to market after playtesting. The developers must have taken what little positive feedback the playtesters could have given the game and removed those elements, as if to say that yes, they can in fact make the game worse. Either that, or the playtesters were all a bunch of brain-dead masochists who somehow think this is game actually represents a ""challenge"" instead of a straight-up ""screw you"" to the player.

This game will make you want to throw your controller, the console, and probably even your entire gaming setup including the chair out a very high window. The crash you'd hear is probably the only satisfying thing you can get out of this garbage. There was potential there, at some point, but the game's creators squandered all of that by utterly failing to understand the concept of ""reasonable challenge.""

I'm a completionist. I've played truly difficult games on their hardest settings just to get the achievements, because that's what I like to do. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but even so difficulty is not a thing for me. But this game isn't difficult. It's just asinine. But I'll probably still complete it through whatever twisted achievement-gobbling OCD I have. But to borrow a line from a movie, ""this will not be over quickly; I will not enjoy this.""

Durham,"The Shield video game, which has sat in development hell for what seems like an eternity thanks to original publisher Sammy folding, is finally here; and it we would have been better off with it still sitting on hiatus.  It's always a gamble adapting a hit, TV show to the video game world.  Sometimes you get good results (X-Files: Resist or Serve), and sometimes, not so much (24).  The Shield falls into that category, and while it features some good voice acting, that's about the only feature of the game that remotely comes close to being redeemable.  Pretty much a lost episode of the series (taking place after the third season), The Shield puts you in the role of dirty cop Vic Mackey, in the midst of the disbanding of his Strike Team.  During the game, you'll track down crooks, interrogate perps, and so forth, but none of it gets to be nearly as fun as it should be.  These game elements are accompanied by some stealth missions, hand to hand combat, and naturally, the dirty cop business which includes planting evidence and stealing.  However, thanks to some terrible controls and touchy response, everything gets lost in translation.  Not to mention that the game itself boasts some just plain awful graphics, and the storyline itself seems to try so hard to be gritty that it just winds up being laughable, not to mention some atrocious dialogue to boot.  As said before, the voice acting is pretty decent, and includes show regulars Michael Chiklis, Walt Goggins, and more.  That being said, The Shield is a terrible game that even die hard fans of the show should avoid at all costs.  No matter how much you love the hard hitting show, avoid this game; it's another prime example of a game not doing justice to it's license when the developer (or new publisher) doesn't put the effort into making some memorable, which a Shield video game could have been.",Avoid,1169337600,6,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

I loved BF1942, BFV, and BF2  but BFBC2 was not so good. when it first came out I was so excited but I had to get a new video card before I could play it. I am glad I waited and only paid $7.00 for BFBC2 because it missed the mark. I went into Battlefield 3 with very lofty expectations, I thought that it would take the best of BFBC2 and combine it with a good campaign, higher weapon damage, Prone, and better graphics.  well it did all of these things except for the campaghn witch was not much better than BFBC2's really bad one. But it is so full of bugs that it is ridiculous!!!!!! and me thinking that Black ops had a lot of bugs when it was first launched. oh stupid me.  I have never played a game this buggy before except for doing beta testing. it also is somewhat unstable and tends to stop working a lot. the game gets 3 stars but there are other aspects that are much worse.

The game uses an online game console called origin(a lot like steam) that is even more filled with bugs than the game is! to use origin you have to tun off any firewall and any anti virus software you have or it will not play the games. but origin also tends to crash my computer. my PC was totally stable until I installed origin and since then It freezes, displays the blue screen of death,and randomly shuts off and upon rebooting it say that there was a fatal error. it also slows down my computer a great deal. it got so bad that I decided to uninstall the game and origin. after doing this my computer was back to normal. I wish this game worked, the graphics are so  cool and except for the ridiculous number of campers it had really fun multiplayer game. everyone complains about steam but origin is far worse, steam was annoying at first but once they had it up for a wile it was all fixed and now I love it. steam never crashed my computer or made me turn off my firewall or slow down my computer even back in 2007 when I first got it. I will buy MF3 if it is released on steam but I will never again bye a game that requires origin.

Oh, well I guess I am going to go back to ArmAII for a military simulator, its a pity no one else plays the MP on that game anymore. oh well back to CoD and HOMEFRONT for MP (HOMEFRONT is only okay) if you are like me and like super realistic shooters and fast paced shooters, you should try Modern warfare 3 it is really good much better than the last two games witch sucked because they had balancing problems. if not and you only like military simulators, try the arma series. if you want to play MP stick with BFBC2 even though that game is seriously flawed it is better to play a flawed game than a game that requires origin.",Could Have Been so Good,1320710400,17,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

AI
The AI on this game though sometimes good is limited to about a 60 IQ when fighting. Though at first the AI seems great soon enough you realize that your homies are dumb. They will go running into a gun fight against 5 gang members with big weapons and they will die every time. When you throw a grenade, they run straight into it. They will run right in front of you when you are shooting and die.

Plot
Though at first the plot seemed good and even though the voice acting is superb, you soon find through the missions the plot gets less and less deep. In fact some of the plot is missing. You'll find yourself wondering if you just missed a whole cut scene, but you didn't. Also it gets very very simple. You can basically guess what's going to happen next.

Missions
Not only are some missions near impossible because you will be up against 8 guys with RPGs but the game will throw such insane things at you that you can't possibly survive. Like going into a mission or defending your turf. You will be doing fine then suddly when you're almost done 3 or 4 cars of guys will drive up and they will all jump out and shoot you full of holes with machine guns. You have 3 seconds to kill them all. You don't have enough time to regain health. Some missions seem simple like hijack a truck and bring it back. Simple except 3 gang cars will be shooting at you and blowing out your tires while trying to run you off the road. Not only that, sometimes the cops will join in too. One time I was run off the road and the truck was stuck. I couldn't move it. I couldn't do anything but wait and watch the timer reach 0.

Glitches
This game is full and packed to the brim with glitches and bugs. Not only will it sometimes slow your game down so much you can barely move but will sometimes freeze the screen and you have to load from save. Glitches go so far as falling through the highway and crashing your car in a ravine. Not falling off the highway falling through it. I've gotten out of a car and appeared waist deep in concrete. I've had my guys decide not to get in a car. I've been unable to get out of the car. I've had a car impossibly flip over a small curb and start on fire and it wouldn't let me out. I've had the controls freeze up so I can't move while people are firing at me. I've had my car disappear when I get out and move the camera away to kill someone. I've had cops come bust me when I didn't do anything. I've had a guy hit me and my guy wouldn't get up then I was blown up by a grenade. I was hit with an RPG and then couldn't get up in time to be hit with another RPG and die. I've had enemies spawn right behind me and kill me. I've had people kill me with a machine gun or handgun from such a far distance I couldn't even see them. I would need a sniper rifle to kill them they were so far away. I had a guy shooting at me with a gun and taking half my life away. I shot back at him with the same gun and even though my sight was dead on I didn't hit him once. I've died when nothing was hurting me. I've had cars randomly appear and run me over killing me in a mission. I've had my character magically disappear a loading screen comes up then I appear somewhere completely different on the map and it wasn't a hospital or store. Just a random place. I've had enemies I'm supposed to chase down disappear from the road right in front of me and appear somewhere completely different on the map I can't even get to. Your homies have no accuracy but the gangs against you are dead on with the most inaccurate weapons.

Some glitches in this game were so bad I couldn't play it. Some parts were so rediculously hard it took pure luck to beat it. I'm not bad at this game. I've had witnesses. I'm not the only one to say these things. I'm going to try and get my money back from THQ. This game is badly developed and seems only half done. All the glitches I stated were playing the game normally and using cheats doesn't have any affect on it. I've tried both.

This game isn't hard it's badly designed. It's nothing wrong with my 360 or the disc it's the programming. I've done debugging on program code before so I know the difference between a hardware error and a software error. If you go to THQ's website you can't get online support for this game. This game didn't have a website or any link on THQ until a few days ago. This game had absolutely no quality assurance and this makes me afraid to purchase any THQ game. This game has more glitches and problems that any other game I have ever played dating back to NES. I would not buy this game and don't recommend it. This game would be great if it weren't littered with problems. It's just a horrible halfway done rehash of a Grand Theft Auto game. It is NOT worth even a dollar.

My problem with this game (and I realize I'm in a small minority here) is that the controls are just plain terrible and ruin the overall experience. I managed to get through a lot of Subspace Emissary (or whatever it's called) and unlocked most if not all of the characters, but the game does not allow the save data to be backed up, and when my Wii broke down for some unexplainable reason, those morons at Nintendo repair erased all the data when they fixed te console. Having to unlock everything again is not fun. It's the opposite of fun. It's a crap-fest with lousy controls that can make simple tasks like hitting switches and even jumping from on platform to another a frustrating chore. I don't know who thought requiring analog controls for side-scrollers was a good idea, but that person should be banned from having any input for game design. The d-pad can be used for moving, but only when using the Wii remote alone, which has more limited buttons; with a Classic Controller and GameCube controller (which only works with older Wiis), it's control stick only while the d-pads are used for taunting and, if you can somehow pull it off, changing Samus' look.
The occasional auto-scrolling in the adventure mode that I originally saw in Super Mario Bros 3 also adds to the frustration.
Now I get what some of you might be thinking: ""This guy sucks at video games and is blaming the games for his problems."" I need only wait for some comments to confirm this. If you don't find the controls terrible, then you'll probably love this game, but that doesn't mean everyone has to.
And in case you're wondering if this is some sort of Sony fanboy rant, I don't care for PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale either; that game is little more than a piss-poor clone (albeit with different characters) that blatantly reminds the player of the premium add-on content he or she didn't buy on the selection screens.

I agree with the other reviews  - this game has some serious flaws which affect playability and general fun!
First Wii Cheer had a great idea in allowing you to use one remote in each hand to execute the moves - this game, in contrast,  has you use the remote in one hand and nunchuck in the other. This idea might work if you are a child...a little child, but as the cord between the two is not that long, the moves are either restricted or impossible to perform for an adult or even a child above 8/9!!
Second is the annoying delay - some of the moves you do are recognized too late if at all, the  other times it identifies moves made, that have not actually been performed!! Add to this the need to calibrate the board between each dance set which adds a delay between play  -very fustrating!!

I strongly urge anybody interested in purchasing a PS3 to do some research prior to see if they are comfortable with the changes that get made. Sony loves to update the firmware on this thing- sometimes for no other reason than to take away features (or add features that inadvertently brick/kill some consoles). They've spent a ton of time on 'security updates'- while leaving things like some of the most voted for features out.

In recent memory-

* firmware update killed the ""other O/S"" feature. You could install linux and such and use it as a little computer. I am particularly miffed about that one. They claimed it was to patch a hole that was a security concern. Oddly enough - a USB device came out afterwards that allowed pirating of things anyways. If you chose not to update- you cannot play games online, you can't update the BR portion of the unit, etc.

*most models do not have backwards compatibility. Not so much a cost saving measure so much as they want to sell the stuff that would've been backwards compatible as re-releases or through the PS Store.

*newest firmware update kills some USB devices (thumb drives, portable hard drives, etc), unofficial controllers, flight sticks, and more. This was to address the hole that came apparent after they nixed the O/S feature.

I pre-ordered a 60gb hardware bc system, picked it up launch day. Let me say now that Uncharted 1/2 are amazing. Resistance is awesome. There are a ton of really great games out there, and as a Blu-Ray player- it is one of the best. That being said- as a gaming machine, the company's policies are absolutely terrible and are not in favor of the buyer at all (and seem to be getting worse). Not a fanboy here- not a fanboy rant. I want to keep loving the system- but Sony makes it so terribly hard. It's a shame- play Wipeout and tell me that there's a better futuristic racer out there right now!

And the kicker. If one breaks- it's $150 + shipping to have it repaired. I've been through a few Xbox 360's (though the new model is rock solid). I am not out a penny with those RROD's. I lost a PS3- and it cost awful close to $200 to get fixed. It died again within 8 months (with proper orientation and ventilation). I got that repair for free (though I had to cover shipping). As it stands now, I am not hooking that unit to the internet and losing any more functions/features.

So- long story short- if you want to watch BR's- it's amazing. If you don't care about functions/features being removed down the road, then go for it. If you don't care about repair costs (or are prepared to fight on the phone- they cut freebies sometimes for people who have had to get multiple repairs), then it's not a bad system. I just strongly urge anybody considering a purchase to take some time and research the pros/cons of the units and see if any of the things (or other issues) are deal breakers.",Strongly reccomend you research first,1285286400,60,,

Like others who have commented it seems to be a blend of Borderlands and Mass Effect. The most confusing part is ""how"" (and, more importantly, ""why"") things are done. There is a lead-in video that sets the story up a bit and then you are given some basic tutorials but that is essentially where the story ends. The missions all seem to be the same: find stuff and kill stuff then rinse and repeat. If you are new to MMO's then this might be a fun entry point. Not much here for veterans.

One other point. I've been playing for a few days and the missions have gone from brain-dead simple to impossible. Not in a good way either, say, by requiring more strategy. It looks like all they did was crank up the mob count quite a bit. I can't pinpoint when the change occured but the last few mission I have run absolutely couldn't be finished by one person. The only way I finished them was to stealth in and run out real quick. Maybe they took the criticism of the missions being too easy to heart and went too far the other way? Not sure. For the most part this game is unplayable by a single person now.

[update]
I forgot to mention the downtime. It's very bad. It looks like they weren't prepared for the number of folks joining the game and the servers are crashing. It's common to have some crashes in the early stages of an MMO but these are fairly frequent (every day for me so far) and, coupled with numerous disconnects, makes for a less than enjoyable experience.",Don't waste your money...,1365292800,7,,

Sonic, the main character, controls horribly. He either goes to fast or to slow, and turns instantly so you fall off things constantly. He can stand on a loop at the top and just stick there. That isn't an intended power, that is just poor programming.

I don't think anyone even play tested the game because some parts are so broken they are almost unplayable.

Loot is rare, I mean scarcely rare, and so randomized you could play, like me, hundreds of hours and get nothing good for your character. BUT, you can take all your gold and try to find an over priced upgrade on the Auction House, a place where you will compete with hundreds of auction house farmers that sit lurking for reasonably listed items they can buy instantly to relist for a 100x markup... Oh, you could do this too of course, if you don't mind drudging through a spreadsheet seeking items to buy and resell... Sound like fun?

Battlefield 4 is a huge disappointment. Not only are the multiplayer maps smaller, the gameplay is more like COD; run around as fast as you can and shoot any enemies you run into. Even worse, this game is riddled with numerous technical problems that make the game virtually unplayable at times.
There are too many problems to list here and likely even more that I haven't encountered yet but here's a few:
The game freezes constantly, especially in Multiplayer mode; all progress and XP is lost and the Xbox console has to be rebooted. This is really frustrating and takes a lot of fun out of the multiplayer game. The loadout menus are hard to navigate and apparently you can only change weapons while you are in a game. Using the server browser can often be a ""road to nowhere""; plenty of empty servers but you can't get into any of them. Getting into an online game is where the game seems to freeze the most. If you have a bunch of friends playing, you can't join as a squad. The launch weekend double XP wasn't working either; Dice's way of thanking customers who pre-ordered or bought the game on the release date.
There are significant issues with the gameplay as well. Players are hard to see at times, often you don't see who killed you until after you're dead. There are major issues with the netcode(the computer code used for online gameplay); you can be killed before an enemy even fires a shot, you empty a clip into him and are killed before he even fires his weapon. As far as weapons go, you can empty an assault rifle clip into an enemy a couple hundred yards away with no effect and he winds up shooting you with a couple shots from a pistol. This makes for a lot of snipers; since you can kill an enemy at the same distance with a sniper rifle or pistol, why not? Camperland; if you stop running, you usually are killed by one of the many snipers. Hard to tell how many hits it takes to kill somebody; I snuck up on a sniper, emptied a full clip from a SCAR-L assault rifle into his head from six inches away, he got up and killed me with a pistol.
OK, it's a new game, there's bound to be some glitches, right? Battlefield 4 does not have glitches, it has major problems; a game that crashes your system and does not work should have never been released. Dice will fix it with a client side patch, right? Don't hold your breath. With Xbox One coming out in a few weeks, most likely the Battlefield 4 for that console has big problems as well and Dice has every available employee working on that so the Xbox One version doesn't crash and burn like this Xbox 360 version did, Xbox 360 gamers are probably going to be in for a long wait until the problems with this game are fixed.
When you pre-order a game on Amazon, it can take a week to get it with standard shipping, never mind the free shipping. You might miss the bonus XP weekend they usually throw on a game's release. This game's double XP weekend was a big fail so I guess it didn't matter in this case. It was also supposed to come with an ""exclusive Amazon pre-order battlepack"" which I have not received. Thankfully, I was able to cancel the COD Ghosts Hardened Edition I pre-ordered from Amazon, I'll never pre-order another video game from them again, just not worth it.
Battlefield 4 is pretty much a loser all the way around. These game developers don't seem to have much respect for their customers, it's getting harder to keep shelling out $60 a game. I'm sure glad I did not pre-order the Xbox One.",Don't Waste Your Money On Battlefreeze 4,1383609600,,,

1.0,True,"07 12, 2014",A2WB7LZ595CR50,B00BGA9YZK,J,"Sadly, I knew from the opening sequence that this game wasn't going to be very good.  I had high expectations that were not only not met but actually dashed to bits.  In a nutshell, this game stinks.

First is the environment.  Forget the lush visuals of the trailers and promos. at least 80% of the game will be spent in dark rooms, hallways, corridors, outer space, spacecraft, vent shafts and other drab environments.  Second, the navigation stinks.  The navigation and objective markers are very confusing at times. And that's only when the directional objective marker actually feels like appearing (there were several times I tried to invoke it, only to get a text display of my objective and nothing more).  It can be more confusing than helpful at times, especially when it rotates 360 degrees, like when you're in outer space, zero gravity or on a multi-level structure.  And some of the mission objectives are just downright confusing.  You'll get a vague hint like ""assist so and so"" but it doesn't tell you that this assistance involves several steps that aren't very intuitive.

The weapons for the most part are decent but there are major shortcomings.  For instance, the game loves to put you in rooms full of ammunition and weapons like you're in a candy store but you can only carry a ridiculously small supply. You get one primary weapon, one secondary and a max capacity refill of reach. There are two types of grenades but you can only carry one type at a time.  When you're looking at a weapon on the ground, you can see the specs for it but the lame comparison leaves a lot to be desired.  Instead of orange and green bars to indicate more or less power, just do a side by side.  The worst glitch with the weapons is that some of them will simply refuse stop working and refuse to fire.  There is no explanation, no little text message to say ""too close to target"" an indication that the weapon is empty or anything.  Nope, you just sit there pressing R2 like a maniac while getting riddled by the enemy.  As if ridiculous cheapness were';t enough, the AI enemies even do little victory dances over your body and take cell phone pics of their kill.  So after the game fails on you, it celebrates its failure in tacky fashion.

There are adrenaline packs that you can use during battle.  They will restore your health and also give you a temporary slowed down Matrix style ""bullet time"" boost.  It's helpful when facing a few enemies but pretty much useless when needed most, against scores of enemies as you'll encounter in the latter stages of the game.  Like the weapons, they also seem to disappear without warning when you need them most.  I'll start a new section with a full supply of adrenaline packs but somehow go down and see the message ""no adrenaline packs available"".

The tactical echo and O.W.L. were the only two things that really stood out about the game and even they had their faults.  They are usually excellent tools in your arsenal, especially for helping  deal with the darker environments.  The tactical echo acts almost like a heat sensor, displaying enemy silhouettes through walls, doors or floors.  The O.W.L. is your personal drone that is capable of providing a shield, attacking enemies, disabling enemy shields and hacking computer systems which accomplishes numerous objectives like disabling alarms, opening doors, navigating ships, disabling security systems, etc. Unfortunately, when you use the most useful features like shield and pulse, it quickly drains the O.W.L. and it will end up off in a corner recharging when you really need it.  Also, as far as engagement, although it occasionally kills enemies, (more in the beginning than latter stages), by the last few chapters of the game, it amounts to little more than a distraction and hacking device.  99% of the enemies will need to be dispatched by you.

All in all, I played the game only because I paid for it. I can wholeheartedly say if this were offered free as a PS-Plus game of the month or some other deal, I likely would have deleted it by now.  I would not buy the game again if given the chance all over again, but everyone has different tastes.  My advice is to watch a couple play through videos online just to get a grasp of the environment you'll actually be playing in versus the much prettier environments shown in the ads.  Might not hurt to rent it first as well, if you're able to do so.  Otherwise, grab it in a bargain bin as cheap as possible or wait to see if Sony offers it as a free PS plus game (highly likely in the near future) if you simply must have it.

However, if frequently getting lost in dark environments with malfunctioning weapons and vague directives while having enemies twerk over your body and take cell phone pics after a ridiculously cheap kill seems like fun, then dive on in.

Now with Opposing Fronts, as soon as load a map, it crashes, and freezes my computer.  This is a known DX10 issue that even with the latest update from Relic, has not been properly addressed.  It happens to users with both NVIDIA and ATI cards from the last generation (7XXX for Nvidia cards)- if you go read the relic forums, it's a common issue.

Until they fix this bug, I can't play the game, much less give it more than 1 star.  However, for the few brief moments that I was able to play, I like the new British units.  I'm a fan of defense and turtling up, so the new British fixed emplacements (howitzers, Bofors guns, Mortars, 17 pndr AT-gun) are an interesting new addition.

***************UPDATE*************************
After the most recent game and Nvidia updates, the game is finally rock solid!  THIS is the product that they should've released, rather than the buggy version.  The campaign missions can be played without crashing, HOWEVER, the skirmish maps crash repeatedly.  Which stinks in terms of keeping the game around for replay-ability...

I could actually finish all the campaigns without a single glitch.  The graphics and physics are incredible, the new units are a hoot to play with.  Like I mentioned above, I'm a big fan of the British.  The 17 pndr and 25 pndr AT-guns and howitzers respectively deal out more damage than the American 105s, and the Priest can rain destructive power down on any part of the battlefield.  The Panzer Elite doesn't feel as different from the regular Wehrmacht as the British do from their American counterparts.  Panzer Elite plays like a stronger armored force, and that's about it.

1.0,False,"07 3, 2008",A3ESEJUNUQZU2I,B0013G0XZC,P R,"As a fan of playing tennis, I was very eager to try Top Spin 3. Since I use my Wii for exercise as well as entertainment, I like to play sports games -- especially tennis ones -- to get some activity. However, although I was initially looking forward very eagerly to Top Spin 3, I found that its execution was seriously lacking.

For one, there are only a handful of players even available, some of which aren't really all that intuitive to guess. I'm not a follower of professional tennis very closely, but even I could see that there are some glaring omissions. Also, there is no character creation, so the individual element is completely absent. They added a few original characters, but they somehow felt that they could not even include a rudimentary character creation mode? Sloppy.

What is most sloppy, however, and utterly disappointing is the game itself. No difficulty settings means that the unforgiving and often very bad control scheme has to be accustomed to on the fly. A pathetically inadequate tutorial does not excuse this fundamental omission. Furthermore, the controls themselves are as far from intuitive as possible; the controller is, for some reason, held sideways. The player's character moves on-screen in a stuttering mess that frequently prevents him from reaching an adequate point from which he may return the ball. The controls, which are supposed to mimic the player's own movements, rarely do this and are token at best. Typically you will try for a special shot exactly as the tutorial instructed, only to have it ignore your movements or misinterpret them.

That doesn't even begin to address the other fundamental problems it has, such as the fact that it doesn't feel like you actually control anything. Even the pop-up help instructs you to time your swings to match the on-screen player. Why, then, are we instructed to swing at all, if the game itself tries to anticipate our swing and then make us match theirs?

I thought that Top Spin 3 would surely be more satisfying than Sega Superstars Tennis which, while a pretty good game, lacked in tournaments and was too harsh when it came to unlockables through them. There also wasn't that much responsiveness depending on specific motions by the player, which Top Spin 3 was supposed to address. Unfortunately, however, it didn't. Sega Superstars Tennis remains a vastly superior game, both in entertainment value and tennis authenticity, even with the super moves.

To boot, Sega Superstars Tennis also had three control schemes, which Top Spin 3 would have benefited from; the movement in Top Spin 3 is atrocious and unresponsive at the worst times. Having an option to handle it automatically would have been a great relief. However, they opted for the extremely awkward option of holding the Wii remote sideways, for no valid reason.

All in all, Top Spin 3 plays like an unfinished tech demo that should never have left the studio. It's a poor excuse for a tennis game, but moreover it's a poor excuse for a game overall. With horrible music, barely adequate sound effects (and an absolutely gratingly annoying umpire/judge voice that belches out his calls), and mediocre graphics, it looks like an unfinished PS2 game that they thought they could slap a full asking price on and sell.

This game isn't even worth bargain bin trips. Give it a miss and buy Sega Superstars Tennis instead, or wait for a more satisfying realistic tennis game. Top Spin 3 isn't it. In fact, it isn't much of anything at all.","A Shoddy Tech Demo, but Full-Priced",1215043200,7,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

The only reason it isn't the worst is due to another Conspiracy Entertainment-published (and Data Design-developed) nightmare titled Ninjabread Man, truly one of the worst games ever published on any platform (which incidentally is nearly a carbon copy of this game, same engine, same music, same godawful controls, you get the picture). How this game was ever given the go-ahead is beyond me. The visuals are dismal, the music and sound effects are poor and mind-gratingly repetitive and the controls, if you want to call them that, surpass being merely unresponsive rendering the game largely unplayable. Like Ninjabread Man, there are no production values to see here. Menus are plain, there's no attempt to flesh out any storyline outside of the manual and the music has to be what's playing in the elevators of hell.

I can't stress this enough: AVOID ANUBIS II LIKE THE PLAGUE! Avoid ANYTHING developed by Data Design and take a good long look before you buy anything published by Conspiracy Entertainment. Publishing ""games"" like this is what made the market crash in 1984 and it's currently hurting the Wii software library as shovelware is a dime a dozen.

GTA III was excellent, the best of the series. GTA IV was not a bad game but, similar to the original BIOSHOCK, it was not worth its idiotic DRM scheme troubles. Hoping that ROCKSTAR had cleaned up its act I made the mistake in giving in to compulsion and buying this from STEAM, where it was on sale. Unfortunately, no matter how cheap one buys a worthless product, it is already too expensive.

I have a year old gaming system at home (i7 920 on a MSI Eclipse with 3GB of DDR3 RAM and a GTX260 nVidia, running WinXP SP3) on which I hardly had any problems running games, old and new alike. It took some hours to complete the download and installation of the about 16GB(!) required for this installment of GTA IV. Since I already had a WindowsLIVE and a Rockstar Social Club Accounts, I just logged in and waited for the game to start. But that was not in the cards. The draconian and convoluted DRM scheme made sure of that. The game kept crashing - over and over!

Writing to STEAM only got me a ""we do not offer support to third-party products"" reply. Cute. They just sell the stuff, why should they make sure it works as promised, right? And by writing to ROCKSTAR I received a cut&paste ""hit the help fora and see what crawls out"" response. No much, it turns out, when it comes to effective advice.

I tried cleaning my registry and temp folders as suggested by some fellow gamers to no avail: the game still crashed just past the initial character-slides/loading screens.
I tried updating all of my drivers, DirectX and Windows Frameworks and this piece of shiit still kept crashing.
I even tried uninstalling numerous programs that might conflict with the DRM, such as PowerISO (as SecuROM is known to be...nervous in its company) - and was rewarded by a BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH! That sure brought back memories, I hadn't had one of those for years!

After deleting the local content I thought about having my credit card company cancel the transaction on the basis that the product I bought never worked. Instead, I decide to pay my bill - to help me remember.

Spend a small amount more and purchase a Qanba Q1 or a Mayflash V2 if you want a budget stick that can actually satisfy you.
Qanba Q1 in particular is honestly pretty nice even unmodified and if you want to be adventurous, is super easy to modify.

Its very difficult to pair with stand. Buttons are unresponsive. Doesnt charge properly on the stand. Pretty much worse design u can come up with for a headset.

So the headset comes with no instructions. Had to use Utube to figure out how to install them. Once installed, the sound level was very low even at the maximum setting. Also no instructions on how to update the firmware on the device. This is probably the worst headset company ive dealt with so far and i will be returning the item to amazon. Goodluck.

Nope, his was too. I initially thought this used a USB connection to directly connect to the Wii U. It does not. Instead, it goes into your Wiimote and your Wii U sees it as a Classic Pro controller. There's problems with this that simply make this a bad choice:

1) Input lag is clearly there. It takes about 15%-25% of the controller's speed out of the equation, especially when your character first moves from respawning or from the match starting. This alone should make you close this tab and never look back.

2) It sees it as a Classic Pro Controller, so your C-stick will often think you're hitting the jab button. Perfect pivots and even following up with standard combos after a jab is so ridiculous. You may as well call the C-stick the Jab-stick. This is severely frustrating if you play competitively or online.

3) Uses Wiimote, so it uses batteries. This is a smaller issue that's not really a problem. But why use something that's inefficient, frustrating, AND wastes battery when you can just use a no batteries required direct connection instead?

Save your money and wait for Nintendo to release more official adapters for 20 dollars OR buy the Maytag version. Yes, this small adapter is also Maytag but the bigger Maytag hub is an actual direct connect AND it works with PCs. So either save your money by waiting for Nintendo's official 4 port adapter for 20 bucks or shovel out 20-30 dollars more for a Maytag 4 port adapter.

Gearbox is and always has been a mediocre game developer. Their big claim to fame is borderlands which is essentially if you put world of warcrafts boring quest system into a wasteland, put it in first person mode, then tout how it has millions of guns but the fact is 1 out of 10,000 are actually an upgrade (repainting the same crummy pistol 5,000 times doesn't make 5,000 different guns) and finally start pimping DLC for the game before it even releases and then keep releasing more to nickel and dime your customers to death by turning a 60 dollar turd into a 100 dollar turd. They also made duke nukem forever which as we all know is a giant steaming pile of you know what and is a god awful abortion from start to finish. The best games they actually made were the brothers in arms games which aren't as terrible as those other two games but its still incredibly sterile, generic and uninspired. BIA is your basic mediocre WW2 shooter and nothing else. They have a few other games under their belt but they are all titles no one really cares about and faded into obscurity as soon as they were released. Bottom line is Gearbox is a terrible game maker and this is a terrible game.

Now for a quickie about colonial marines.

The story is nothing short of fan fiction written by someone who cannot write but still posts to their blog and believes themselves to be a great writer. It's kind of like how a young girl will take pictures of furniture sitting in a shadow in black and white and then think they are really deep and brooding for taking such artistic photographs when in fact it's just garbage. They tried to wink at the fans so hard their eyes have fallen out because of it. Everything about it feels very amateur, boring and forced. It feels more like they did a sci-fi channel original aliens movie, or something that went direct to video.

The game is buggy as you can get. I've flown out the side of things and floated high in the air stuck. I've had allies that would stick in walls. Hell I found out in section you were supposed to be stealthy starting out and I just ran past every alien and once I passed them they forgot about me and I finished a level without firing a shot. I see environmental objects get stuck in things and so on.

All the pretty and cool looking screenshots and videos I've been seeing for over a year from now weren't from the same game they released. You can easily find comparison videos showing the game released looks just awful compared to the ""in game footage"" they showed in the past.

Multiplayer is very sterile and pretty much what you'd expect. It's so boring in fact that multiplayer will be a ghost town in 2 months.

The game play its pretty much call of duty. It's just a mix of ""it's the last stand....again"" and ""quick run through fast as you can"" with some boring corridor stalking in between.

Instead, it's a twenty dollar game that plays like freeware and has packaging like Myst.
Incidentally, it was the references to Myst on the packaging that led me to buy this game.  The packaging says, ""Think Myst but in a real location"" (Quandary).  True, like this game, Myst was basically snapshots of a fictional world that you could occaisionally interact with, much like this game, but there's a few big differences between Myst and this game.  Myst never really felt like a string of snapshots to me, because the world it depicted was so beautiful and mysterious, and the puzzles were so engaging.  Capri is beautiful, but moving through it is confusing and frusterating.  There are so many places where one street looks just like another, which makes getting turned around or lost really easy, unless you check the map every step of the way, and doing that just makes the game feel even more clunky.  I enjoyed the scenery in Myst, but I could care less about the many, many snapshots of streets that A Quiet Weekend in Capri includes.  There should really be a better way to navigate the world of this game.  I haven't finished this game yet, but the puzzles mostly seem to involve doing errands for people, which, combined with the frusterating navigation, becomes incredibly tedious.  The people themselves are another annoying aspect of the game.  It's impossible to talk to any of them, which seems odd for a game that takes pride in being located in a real place.  You'd think being able to talk to people would add to the reality of it.  The people themselves are also snapshots, by the way.  They are never animated, even when they're talking - even Myst animated talking people.  There are, in fact, very few animations in this game.
This game has, for me, redefined bad games.  I cannot believe that someone allowed this game to be released.

I read everything carefully, planned to get a memory stick with this box, and expected this to work. I've had nothing but issues. It didn't work with my HDTV. I guess because I have a cheap, off brand TV, so I ordered the HDMI cable and hooked it up to my PC. Then I got picture but no sound, so I went to radio shack and bought an adapter so I could hook it up (using the AV cable do now I have to use two different cables) and I finally have both picture and sound! Great. Play Skyrim = disappointing graphics, slow, glitchy. Runs better on my PC. Try one of my original xbox games and it won't play. I get an error message that it won't play without an xbox hard drive. What!? No where in my research, no where, is this mentioned. The Amazon page itself says it's backwards compatible!! Everywhere I looked said some xbox original games are backwards compatible with xbox 360 (there are lists). What a waste of time and money. Seriously disappointed. The main reason I bought it was to play my original xbox games and a few new 360 that I was interested in. I'm not even sure I can return at this point. Really be aware of what you are buying. However much research you do, do more.

UPDATE: I'm still trying to get this thing to work. I ordered a hard drive on Amazon that said it was compatible with this make/model. I had to plug in 3 times, do a restart and force an update, but I finally got the 360 E to recognize the inserted hard drive. However, it STILL won't play xbox original games as advertised! The full 250gb hard drive is required, which means another $60 on top of what I paid for the 4gb and smaller hard drive. Don't waste your time or money on this thing. Buy a 360 with a 250gb hard drive and be done with it.

UPDATE: Now, to add insult to injury, I can't play Dragon Age Inquisition on the 4gb, even with the memory stick. It won't install. You have to have a 360 partitioned harddrive, same as the original xbox games issue I had. I can't play original xbox games and now I can't play new xbox 360 games. No where on the Dragon Age Inquisition page did it say it wouldn't install to a memory stick. What good is this 4gb? It's a complete waste of time and money as far as I can tell. Just a scam to get you to pay more for the hard drive when you can't play anything. Get the 250gb 360 and don't even bother with this. Seriously, what a scam.",Great.

When the free weekend ended with out even getting to see a pixel of the game, I complained - while remaining civil - but got flamed from all sides and my topic was pulled from the board.

If you are new to the hack 'n slash genre, I could see this being a fun game.  It just does not compare, the game slows down a lot (even with the bad graphics), only has 3 characters and the moves are just OK... not enough variety.

When I think about Dynasty warriors and how much variety it has, this game really is just trying to pull the 'sex sells' act and spend a month throwing together a game and put 'bikini' in the title because they know it cannot compete with it's peers.

The game can be fun if you haven't experienced others in its genre.  But it is short, the game has little replay value with only 3 characters (compared to near 100 in some games), and overall any comparison you make to any other recent game in the genre is basically terrible.

My experience with Thq has been that they put out games without fully testing them, leaving glaring issues, and then make little to no attempt to fix them if the game doesn't end up as one of their best sellers. I will never buy a Thq product again after the way the fans of UFC 3 were treated. They sold the game with an unplayable online mode, among other issues, and never attempted a patch, while lying continuously for MONTHS saying one was coming out. They basically closed threads on their forum to hide the problem, the only being left ones that dangled a carrot-on-a-stick in the form on a non-existent patch to keep their dwindling sales going for as long as possible.

1.0,False,"10 22, 2008",A12C29D5N444NF,B000X9FV5M,Mr. Knowledge,"This is my opinion of this game.

I purchased this game from EBGAMES not Amazon, when it first came out believing from all the hype this game was going to be great based upon the first Far Cry game and video previews shown.  Big mistake!  This game is nothing like the first game.  The first game was fun!  This game is completely frustrating and depressing in every way possible.  This is probably just like the real Africa itself, which leaves you with the feeling like you need to commit suicide.  And believe it or not that is how the game ends you are forced to commit suicide sounds fun doesn't it NOT.  This game was a forced political statement regarding the state of Africa.  One final problem with this game is that you are also forced to sit through 10 minutes of credits after you complete the game and before you get access to your computer.  10 minutes I kid you NOT, then after the computer comes back you can remove the disk and say to yourself that was the worst game I have ever wasted 50 hours of my life on.  Too bad this game had a chance of being a good game, until the player got sick could not fight and died, the player must travel long boring distances and fight his way through respawning check points in every mission, just to get to a mission, every weapon malfunctions at some point, the enemies don't take damage correctly (I had a enemy that was hit with a 50 Cal sniper riffle get up and kill me), the vehicles break and do not take damage properly, your forced to find medicine and take pills during most important firefights and you die 1/2 the time due to it,  your forced to take a break and inject yourself and perform surgery during a firefight and you die 1/2 the time, your forced to save the game after every single fight to preserve your progress.  It is one interruption after another, which makes for one horrible frustrating game and no fun.  Hopefully, the game engine will be used and tweaked by another worth while developer that actually knows how to make a fun game that flows.  Hopefully, that new developer will say no to DRM, so you can actually play the game you purchased!  This game's graphics are really nice and fire effects are awesome, but this game is not worth the frustration.

This game is defective on so many levels.  Two major bugs you can rely on to get your money back are as follows 1) There is a defective mission bug in the game itself that prevents you from rescuing a hostage at the cockfighting area in the game.  You are unable to proceed with the game due to this error (there is a work around but it clearly renders this game defective) and 2) the Sony DRM copy protection software prevented me from running the game on my system half of the time.  I constantly got an error that stated the original disk was not in the drive, when it was in fact in the drive.  It is like gambling in a casino when I went to launch the game to see whether or not the game would actually load correctly or give me the error message and prevent me, a paying customer, from playing the game.

I contacted Sony and EB Games regarding the DRM disk problem which was unable to be resolved.  UBI support is non existent on its website.  Only other players offer any kind of help.  It took EB Games two weeks before an actual human being contacted me by phone.  All of their emails to me for help took the position that EB Games has a no return BS policy on a open product, which is clearly illegal.  EB Games did in fact give me a refund, after speaking in person to the EB Games representative, so chalk one up for EB Games taking responsibility for its defective games.  If any retailer refuses to give you a refund for this defective game just dispute the charge on your credit card.  This works every time even in light of the no refunds on open products policy most retailers have.  If it does not work seek legal help.  So be persistent and you can force these giant companies to compensate you for their unfinished horrible DRM invested products they sell and force on you. Whether this will change their conduct to create a better product is yet to be seen.  But this will take profits away from these companies and force them to obey the law in the United States!

If consumers make these companies refund enough sales you can make them change their horrible policies of treating every customer as a criminal.  And by the way EB Games didn't even want their game back lol, probably because the DRM prevents any type of resale lol (they screw themselves also)!

This is a great way to get your money back without incurring attorney fees, learn it, use it!  I hope some of you disappointed with this game use this method to get your money back.

This game and any other games using SONY DRM should be removed from Amazon and all other retail stores due to their defective nature! These games with SONY DRM are all ""non-conforming goods"" under the Uniform Commercial Code, and you can get a refund based on these defects in all 50 States, in the USA!  Or you can just decide not to buy the game.

A major problem with the Steelseries Xai and Rival Vanilla is that the rubber coating/grip has a perfect day one feel which quickly starts wearing away. The feet are also not rounded from the center like you should see on a brand new Rival Vanilla(they are slightly round at the edge compared to the Rival 300's flat skate). Further, the left click feels too tight and could be enough of a problem on its own.

I also got to point out this strange bug I didn't yet solve that was referenced in another review:
""Mouse can't tell the difference between single left click and middle click. 9 out of 10 times when single left clicking chrome tabs, it thinks im hitting the middle click to close the tab. Will be getting a replacement, or refund for different.""

So, I am disappointed I didn't buy brand new and haven't seen a review touch on any of these refurbished product issues.

This game is hemorrhaging customers and fans, and there is a reason:

1) Atrocious customer service
2) Minimal endgame - its a joke
3) Theme-park style game play
4) Gestapo-nazi-esq forum moderation to hide the truth
5) Game engine is a 3rd party pile of junk.  The fact it still running DX9 when DX11 is already out pretty much explains everything.  Game engine is unable to handle more than 50ish people in a shard/instance etc and thus must be split up (even in fleet)
6) Economy is non-existent
7) Arcade on rails ""space-battles"" is a sick joke
9) Dev's are clueless and disconnected
10) PVP is a joke
11) Crafting is nonexistent
12) Classes are completely imbalanced

There are so many ways to compare this to the big elephant that is WOW, but this game just falls flat on its face.  And don't even bother dealing with customer service, or point out problems, because you WILL BE MODERATED.  Its a massive BW/EA coverup really, to hide how bad the state of this game is.

Emmett Wallman,"after seeing ther would be a college basketball game for the ps3, i was in awe, waiting to get it. there was a long delay when i firs pre ordered the game from the ogame store here on amazon. it arrived fast (great service ogame) well the game doesnt look that good to me. i have nba07, nba2k7 and now i got this because i LOVE and i repeat LOVE basketball games. well, the game is all hype.

-the first thing i noticed is that the arenas done even look like the real arenas at all. trust me, i have seen plenty of them and the details are very minimal. duke's home court looks the worst of them all last time i played the game. NOT GOOD!!!

- the player details were average because they don't look at all like the real players on the real team. for example, OSU (my favorite team) greg odon looks verry different in real life than in the game. he was the big man in the center like in real life, but some of the players didn't look good at all. i remember some of the players had a darker skin color than it should be and one player who was supposed to be white was a black guy. NOT GOOD!!! i was expecting there to be a little more detail there. note that the team uniforms need more detail as well. if you look at the back of the OSU jerseys, you can see that the stripe on the back of the jerey goes through the players number. its not like that in real life and i have a OSU jersey to prove it if you don't believe me.

- now it gets down to the gameplay. its the exact same as nba2k7. no complaints there. it seems to me that it is a little easier to make as shot in the college game, but trust me on this every time you score a basket, the other team will come right back, no matter what difficulty you set it on.

- i know there are some extra features in the game. i have never fiddled around with them, but i doubt i ever will.

- there is that stupid motion sensing free throw routine in this game just like there is in the nba2k7 game. like  the nba game, making a free throw is impossible and this isn't a joke. my friend can do it sometimes but even the best free throw shooters are hard to make with.

- it seems that the framerate is pretty bad the game tends to slow down alot and the picture seems to be a little fuzzy at times. NOT GOOD!!! the ps3 i know is way more powerful than the 360 and it should definately have a better framerate.

OVERALL

- 2k sports, you really screwed this game up. the 360 version is better and i play march madness on the 360 and it is way better. 2k sports takes the 360 game and transfers it onto the ps3 disc and adds the motion sensing free throws. 2k, you should step it up a notch and make a completely different game for the ps3. its a completely different system than the 360 and each system should deserve their own version of the game.

-i am taking this game to the local game store over my next college break and trading it in for some other games or cash. im very disappointed in the effort put into this game (mainly because its exactly the same as the 360) and if i ever consider buying a 2k college hoops game again next year, there better be a big improvement.",not good,1175558400,4,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jJKbjmniL._SY88.jpg']

The quality is there, but the keys are so screwball looking, you would think it was russian symbols they were using (my wife immediatley noticed that, and said the same thing, ""What is that, a RUSSIAN KEYBOARD?!?"").  The keys are ""clicky"" keys too, which I honestly wasn't expecting, and although not as loud as the K70, they aren't quiet enough to seal the deal.  The other thing, which really bothered me was the lighting affects.  The keys are VERY bright, which is awesome, where as the K70's, are dimmer in comparison, despite the K70's colors being richer overall imo.  The really noticable color was the red though...the K70 red is very hard to see, and a bummer color to use for me, where as the BlackWidow had an excellent, bright red.  Both have a wave function, where the colors flow across the keyboard, but the Blackwidow was like lights changing from red slam to green, slame to blue, etc.  It wasn't a fade as one would expect, and I couldn't stand the look of it.  Seemed very cheap, and like it just didn't have the control to smooth that out, no matter what I tweaked in the settings.  The K70, flows fluidly between colors, and looks way nicer by a long shot in this respect.

I really wanted this keyboard since I run a Razor DeathAdder mouse that you couldn't pay me to let go of, and having a matching pair of Razor products would just be cool, but I just couldn't get behind the Russian key look, the uesless clicky keys, the lack of rich, deep colors, and the very odd wave transition on this keyboard.

1.0,False,"10 17, 2006",A35ML7BRY81XFF,B000HCQJZQ,Mr. RTS,"I am a big fan of the ""Age"" games and I am very sorry to report that
the War Chiefs Expansion is the worst ""Age"" Expansion ever released.
The War Chiefs Expansion offers mostly new content and almost no real new features.
No only that, all the existing bugs from Age of Empires 3 were not fixed, and were passed to the expansion.
In addition to that the biggest missing feature from Age of Empires 3 - playing Custom Scenarios Online, is not included in the expansion.
Numerous Scenario Editor's bugs that were reported to Ensemble were not fixed either.

As I said before, I played Age of Empires 3 for hundreds of hours.
In general it is a good game but the bugs are just very annoying, and it gets worse the more you play the game.

You would expect the expansion to fix all the problems, but instead they were ignored.
They went ahead and added new campaign and 3 new civilizations and few extra units and that the most of it.

If you buy the expansion you won't notice much difference when you compare it to the original game.

Ensemble advertise their ""powerful scenario editor"" but fail to mention that they are not supporting the editor, and that they are not planning to fix any of its bugs.
The scenario may be powerful, but it is extremely buggy and very user UNfriendly.

The list of existing bugs that were carried over to the expansion is very long.
Here is a short sample:
1. Online ""Drop bug"" - players can drop in purpose when they loose.
2. Gathering point for releasing combat units from war ships doesn't work.
3. gathering point for remote mines and trees doesn't work, as the settlers arrive at the remote location but don't gather resources.
4. Attack move doesn't work when you click (left click or right click) on any enemy building.
5. ""Out of Sync"" error in the middle of online games is still an issue one year after the game was released.
6. The ""2 minute resign"" bug - players can resign within two minutes from an online game and suffer no impact on their rating.
7. Numerous bugs with Walls (too long to get into).
8. Mortars don't attack buildings when they are in range unless they are instructed to do so.
9. Very often you cannot release a large number of units from a ship in one time.
10. ""Obstruction Radius"" bug - There is a bug with the obstruction radius of War Ships that makes them overlap with each other.
11. 2V2 in ""Quick Search"" online doesn't work. The option is there, the players are there, but you will never get a 2V2 match no matter how long you wait.
12. It is not possible to create a gate when there are units standing next to that wall segment.
13. Ships that carry units or train units cannot release the units unless their nose is all the way at the shore.
14. The AI has many issues and limitations, yet it was not improved at all.
15. Online games are very laggy, especially the 2V2 games.

In the past year Ensemble released 9 patches with emphasize on ""Balance"" changes instead of bug fixing.

There is also the issue of One CD Key per game.
Many fans complained about that.
Once a player creates an online account, he cannot change it, delete it or reset it.
Only one online account can be created per game.

As mentioned above the AI in the War Chiefs expansion is so stupid that it is very easy to beat it even on ""Hard"".
It is even more stupid than the regular game.

Also this game that is all about Rushing. Turtling and Booming are not viable strategies in the War Chiefs expansion.
These three strategies supposed to counter each other, but not in this game.
Defensive structures are very weak in the War Chiefs making ""Rushing"" the best strategy, even against ""Turtling"".
Outposts are good only against ships and cavalry, but very weak against infantry and artillery.
Walls can be taken down easily due to their low hit points.
Only one Fort is allowed and we can not rebuild it if it is taken down.
As a result ""Rushers"" have an advantage, as ""Rushing"" counters ""Booming"" as well as ""Turtling"".

The War Chiefs expansion is all about new content such as a new campaign, 3 new civilizations, and a few new units for the other civilizations, that's it.
The ""Treaty"" game type is just a new ""no rush"" map option to accommodate players who like to play ""No Rush"" games .
The ""Trade Monopoly"" is very similar to the ""Wonder"" type game that was included in previous ""Age"" games, so it is not really a new feature.

That is all there is in this expansion.
Almost no new features, no new physics, just some new content, that is all.
In addition to that, all the bugs from the original game are still there.

Those faces on the cover were generated on Photoshop, and no way they were a result from the game.

The jobs and needs were actually improved, but they are implemented on a game that lacks all that which made the previous ones great. The Sims seem more stupid and reluctant to follow directions. The number of objects is really small and the expressions and body language are the same from Sims 2 but the difference in color and animation only serves to remind you of what you aren't playing.  The greater loses are with the female Sims they never look feminine at all. It is very strange.
That and some crashes made me place the game back on the shelf.  In a couple of months I'm sure there will be a patch (or more...) that will reduce the crashes and the number of objects will larger with downloads.

Plus I was a huge fan of the new Grand Theft Auto 5 game. So when the concept of the people who made Assassin's Creed were making a Grand Theft Auto style game, I was all over it. But I'm afraid to say that I just didn't like the game at all. I guess the best way to describe this game, is exactly the way that the guy at Gamestop described it to me ""It doesn't really do anything well, it's all just ok."" Nothing is more close to the truth then this. And it's VERY frustrating, because it feels like a step backwards for the company because of this. The game feels very sluggish to me, there is nothing fluid about it. From the driving to the stealth and moving around. I'm not sure if this is due to lack of attention, or simply inexperienced people working on this title. Plus another further thing that is REALLY annoying. You can't customize the controls, and the way they have some of these controls set up, you scratch your head wondering if they even realized how inconvenient some of the button placements were. An example of this is the power break being the O button and X being to look behind your vehicle (logically you'd make X your power break since it's easier to reach). Then when you go into the options menu, under control schemes, it gives you 4 total options. The default for right handed people, and THREE, count em, THREE Left handed options for Left Handed players. Let me tell you something I AM Left handed, and I would NEVER play the game with the controls they have set for lefties. I think video game developers don't seem to realize that left handed people are raised in a world designed for right handed people, meaning anything you can do with your right hand, we can pretty much do, with the exception of writing. So yea they should have focused more on giving different variations to regular right handed controls. I'd say if renting is still possible (I think they closed almost everywhere you can rent from down lol) rent it or borrow it from a friend, but do NOT pay $60 for THIS game.

1.0,False,"02 17, 2012",A2WE8VVT8JZOCI,B00542XGPA,Zhang,"NBA 2K12 for the PC has the worst game play of any recent 2k series basketball games.  2K placed too much emphasis on making the animations look accurate and didn't focus enough on making the game play accurate.  This is evident when trying to move the player.  There is a lag between input and the player moving.  Not because of any hardware issues, but because the game has to smoothly transition the animation from what you were doing previously to what you want to do now.  I get it, you want to make things look realistic.  But personally, I'd choose accurate movement over a little bit of animation roughness.  This issue makes it very annoying on defensive because it makes you overcorrect all of the time.  Let's say a cpu player is driving to the right and you follow with your player and go right.  If the cpu cuts left, and you move your stick left, because of the delay, your player doesn't move initially, so you develop a habbit of overcompensating by moving left more than needed to catch up to the cpu, but the cpu will ""see"" the overcorrection in the input before the animation shows up on the screen for you to see so it will cut the cpu player back right and blow right by you.

On offense you cannot run around without the ball without the defense bumping you and stopping you on the spot.  Makes it impossible to run plays in My Player mode.  Last time I checked the rules, it's a foul on defense if a defensive player impedes the progress of the offenseive player.  Apparently, 2K wrote the code so that the animation of players bumping into one another and stopping each other will execute if two players run too close to one another... every single time.  Do these programmers even watch basketball?  It's the same issue when trying to drive the ball.  The cpu will simply move along with you and then all of a sudden if you get closer to the cpu defensive player, the bump animation will occur, stopping your drive immediately.  I believe that's called blocking in the real world.

There's also a bug with the turbo button if you're dribbling the ball.  The ball handler is apparently capped at a slower speed no matter what their speed attribute is.  I was playing as Chris Paul on a breakaway with the turbo button mashed down and some no name center on the Timberwolves 5 feet behind me chased me down!

Blocking and stealing is hugely outbalanced in this game between the player and the cpu.  The cpu reaction time for either is near instantaneous.  It makes it impossible to make tight passes no matter how good your passing rating is, because the cpu will just snatch it out of mid air.  And I get the sense that the cpu can read where the animation for your player is going to do and block you easily.  It doesn't help that your guard during a lay up will jump towards the outreached hand of the cpu defender and literally shoot the ball at the cpu's hands.

Dribbling is another issue.  This is the first game where I have seen a maxed dribbling rating player will dribble the ball ONTO the defensive player's feet and lose the ball.  WTF!!! Not dribbling onto someone's foot should be pretty basic knowledge and yet, it happens 3-5 times during a 30 minute game.

Another issue is the rebounding.  I tried playing with a 7'4"" center with maxed rebounding and I often got outrebounded by guards on my team.  The problem is the cpu knows where the rebound will go as soon as the ball leaves the shooter's hand.  The cpu players will run to the perfect one rebound spot and even if you get inside position and jump for the ball, the ball will magically go through your hands and arms like you're a ghost, and land in the cpu guard's hands.  You can tell the cpu knows if a shot will result in a rebound because if the shot will go in, the cpu will not box you out at all.  But if the shot will be missed, the cpu will box you out as far out as the 3pt line.  But if you watch the other cpu players, the cpu will not box out other cpu players.  They only box you out.  And too well actually.  It is near impossible for my 7+ foot 300+ pound max strength center to muscle out a 6 foot guard in a box out once they have the inside spot.

Don't get me started on AI.  Simply terrible.  When I call for a pick and roll, the cpu player won't roll after setting a pick.  They just stand there, or sometimes my center with no 3pt ability will run out to the 3pt line after the pick. Why?!?!?  And if you call a play for a cpu player to run a curl through some off ball picks, half the time, the cpu will just run a straight line from point A to point B and not curl or use the picks.  And on fast breaks, all and I mean ALL your cpu teammates will run to the same spot under the basket which means the single cpu on defensive can easily guard against a 3-1 by running to the same spot, which they do.  It basically turns every breakaway into a 1-1.  Unless the cpu is running a breakaway against you, at which point somehow the cpu relearns how to run an offense properly and spreads the floor out.  On defense the AI on your team will randomly switch assignments, often at inopportune times leaving offensive players wide open.  Check out youtube for some ridiculously stupid AI defense.

BTW, it is now the first half of 2/2012 and the pc still hasn't gotten the gameplay patch/fixes that the consoles got int 10/2011.

Played a few hours, enjoying it so far. Get to a mission where I have to collect a few ""glowing spots"". Getting 5 or so allowed me to unlock 2 powers. Afterwards I see them all over the city and collect a few more when I notice a message that I have collected ""3 out of 100"" of them. I metaphorically sigh in relief. If I only have to collect 100 of them for the entire game, and they are all over the place, it is still more boring-work than should be in any game...ever, but at least it is manageable.

Turns out I was wrong. You have to collect something like 1250 of them. Oh my ******* ***, I am never EVER going to spend that many hours doing nothing but boring obnoxious filler that incompetent designers added to their game in an effort to try and make it seem longer.

Snake's Revenge just does so many things wrong I don't know where to begin in describing the many noticeable problems.  Let's start with the way Snake moves.  He moves slow and clunky this time around as do the enemies, whereas on the first Metal Gear the pace moves swiftly.  Nothing particularly great mind you, but a lot better than this.

Stealth and infiltrating is comically an afterthought now.  Yes that's right- you know how you're supposed to avoid being detected by guards?  Know how you're supposed to walk up behind them or sneak around without being noticed?  Well Snake's Revenge seems to abandoned this great concept unintentionally with horrible gameplay and slow, uninspiring animations of the tiny characters and foes we see on screen.  You can practically walk directly up to a guard and be mere inches in front of him without him freaking out and spotting you.  What in the world?  However the funniest thing about this game is that the animations are so pitiful when you punch or shoot someone to death, they show no reaction to the fact you just damaged them so they freeze in place, then a moment later they simply disappear.  LOL!  The first Metal Gear was a lot better than this.

Most of the gameplay involves walking throughout abandoned and very generically created storage facilities with a strong emphasis on finding items (such as the overuse of collecting and using key cards) in small rooms to advance the... not the plot since the game practically has none, but to advance to the next boring part of the storage facility while equally unimpressive music appears throughout your little quest.  I actually think the horrible animation of the guards along with your character and overall taking a few steps back compared to the first Metal Gear is the biggest issue I have with this game.  The lack of enemy variety is another problem, as is the repetition of looking for items, rescuing trapped people that give simple useless advice with laughably bad grammar, and of course the unbearably slow play control are MORE major issues.  This game is a disaster all around.

The challenge level goes up a lot just as soon as you find yourself in rooms with floor traps such as disappearing floor tiles that expand really wide and other types of traps that require carefully maneuvering around in order to succeed.  This is all rather difficult.  The game has a way of making the boss fights really difficult and swarming you from many different directions but countering this with simplistic guards roaming the hallways in the other portions of the game, so Snake's Revenge has major imbalance issues.  In fact most of your time is spent walking back through the tiny rooms where you came and loading up on ammo since ammo reappears in the same spot the moment you leave the room.  You can easily fill up on ammo this way.  Not that you really need much of it except for the inevitable boss fights.  The story is nonexistent and unexceptional, and I can't think of a single reason to ever play this train wreck of a game.  It's just awful no matter how you slice it.",snake's lost it,1408233600,,,

Ensure there is no damage to it, or the braided cable, and plug it into your PC to ensure it works as well. You're paying a good $60 (Lowest price its been to date)-$80 bucks for this mouse, so you should expect it to be free of flaws and defects, but this mouse was nothing but flawed. This is not a knock against Corsair. I love their quality products - but the Black Corsair Gaming SCIMITAR MOBA/MMO Gaming Mouse has some serious quality control issues. The mouse itself feels great, and the macros are as well, but quality wise? Corsair needs to honestly take a better look at how these mice are made.

The first mouse I received had an issue with the right clicker. Okay, maybe I was unlucky, I requested a replacement.

The second one had an issue with the wheel (Loud, clunky noises), braided cable seemed as if it was picked at slightly, and area where the cable and mouse looked as if it was not fully sealed/attached, compared to the first one.

Alright, I'm just really unlucky - I requested another replacement.

You'd think the third's time the charm, correct? The 3rd one looked 'okay,' aside from button #11 protruding out more than the rest, but then I unwrapped the cable, and noticed the braided cable had massive damage on it, about 3 or so giant, pointy hard things coming out of it. What is wrong with these mice?

After speaking with Amazon, I had the option to either get a refund, or try a replacement. Because of Corsair's reputation for quality products, I chose to try one last replacement and promised myself that it would be the last one. At this point, I'm starting to think all the planets must have been aligned in order for such bad luck to happen.

So the 4th one would surely be okay, right? Somewhat. The right side, above the side keypad - it looks like it was carved at/sliced. I can live with it - It's fine since it's just cosmetic damage, but I shouldn't have had issues with all 4 mice. It's really upsetting.

I'm keeping one, due to its great feel and uses, but I'm really disappointed in Corsair and their lack of Quality Control for this mouse. I do not know if this is the case for the Yellow version of this mouse.

Overall, please do not let this steer you away from Corsair products, as their keyboards are nothing BUT amazing - But that's a different review. Again, if you get this mouse, inspect it, the cable and see if it works. Hopefully you get a good working one. If not, I'm sure Amazon will have no issue helping you.",WARNING - QUALITY CONTROL ISSUE,1459382400,9,{'Color:': ' Black'},

Not many of the levels were amazing, either. Just long hallways, small rooms, and an occasional elevator shaft that you  climb up. I like 3D games that let you be outside, looking over vast plains  of enemies and obstacles. Half-Life just didn't cut it in this  arena.
Another thing that I found most disturbing was the extreme  gore/violence that is present throughout the game. When your science  project goes wrong, you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground  with about 10 gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor! Were  the programmers just trying to be sick here or what? When you reach the  levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts (who are the best  enemies), it gets even more grotesque. If you let off an entire clip of  bullets at one guy, expect to see a wall covered with blood. Sure, you can  turn it off, but it does very little good. The blood is still very  disturbing. This is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable.  I am not a parent saying this, either, I'm a teenager.
Aside from the  violence and lack of interesting levels, the game is pretty much void of  any lasting qualities.

Wow, I wasn't really expecting this to happen... picked up the tin box special edition from my local gamestop, ran home to install, and get things going.

First few mintues were an immediate disbelief that I may have wasted $70 on the special edition (though the goodies that came with the special edition are kinda neat).

The graphics immediately looked sub-par, the voice acting was shabby, and the gameplay was just god awful.

I said ""no biggie, cant wait to get into the wastelands""

After what seemed like a 25 minute waste of time, and a really poor intro, i finally made it out of vault 101.

I looked, expecting a breath taking surreal post-nuclear war enviornment in brillant detail.

I was so horribly wrong.

While the character models are strong, the rest of the environment looked a tad bit less graphical than STALKER. And STALKER graphics weren't even that impressive.

And on top of it all, after attempting to adjust to the control scheme, it just felt ""lost"" and kinda spread out all over in all sorts of annoying and inconvienent menus.

Even VAT was pretty pathetic, and doesn't add much interest into a game that as if it was a familiuar feeling of something I've allready played in Chernobyl, with less than average animations, graphics, story, etc.

Another problem the game has is that it cant quite seem to choose what it wants to be.... a 1st person shooter, 3rd person shooter, or a RPG. While the idea of the mix is intriguing, it just doesn't work out well in the game, and is poorly implemented.

I don't understand how things could have gone so horribly wrong with this game. More importantly, I have no idea how this game is getting the reviews it's gained, other than maybe the magazines were just desperate for some under-the-table payoff.

Your money would be far better spent on Farcry 2, Dead Space, or STALKER Clear Sky at this point.

And this was playing it on a ultra-high end gaming rig.

I'm sorry folks, and I'm more sorry to the folks who bought this just like me. If you've picked it up, do your self a good justice and just return it if the seal has not been broken.

If I am going to pay $400-500 for a video game console, it better be worth it. When sony went from PS1 to PS2 it was a huge step, big jump in graphics and game quality, it was worth the wait for the next console to come out, when PS3 came out, again Son lead the way, big step in gameplay and graphics, so you expect the same based on history when the release of PS4 was announced, but it was a big flop.

UNBOXING:

The game is a standard Xbox CD and  comes in a clamshell that only has two pamphlets.  Neither one tells you how to play.

GAMEPLAY:

The game is very detail oriented, and replicates a virtual Disneyland to a tee.  However, the controlling of the avatars is a PAIN IN THE @$$!  The game will often drop the player for no reason.  When coming back into the game, you need to wave frantically and it doesn't always (mostly never) pick you up again.  Then when you get back in the game, your avatar randomly changes: from boy to girl and vice versa, and from race to race.

There's a little ticket avatar that tells you the basics of movement: essentially hold your hand out to go directions forward, left and right.  Wave to interact with other avatars.  Hands in the air to take a picture.  But that's it.  As far as how to play any of the games, there are no instructions.

PROS:

- It's Disneyland!
- Voice overs sound like Disney Character cartoons

CONS:

- Controlability (BIG CON)
- No instructions

OVERALL:

This game IS NOT for anyone under the age of 10.  All of my kids cannot play this game because of the glitches in the contolling avatars.  They all gave up within 5-10 minutes of playing.

Add the menu style of the racer Dirt, and you've got Operation Flashpoint. I'm not joking - since Codemasters made this and Dirt, the menus are very similar. they'll flash on screen with your stats (kills instead or racing stats)...

Pros:
- the game works. it spins in the tray.
- it's not rogue warrior

Neutral:
- the game is trying to go for a military sim, not a military arcade shooter (i guess). i suppose it gets this right (1 shot can equal instant death), but this isn't any fun.

Cons:
- very short
- generic story
- textures are mediocre
- color is washed out
- you will be walking and walking and walking forever. this is utterly boring. did you get killed? since the game's checkpoints are barely existing, you be walking and walking all over again.
- the gameplay is literally Ghost Recon 1. Utterly generic. follow your instructions to the next objective, kill those guys, go to objective 2, blow that thing up, go to extraction point. repeat for 10 chapters. We did this 10 years ago in Ghost Recon 1, which at the time was a great game...
- checkpoints are HORRENDOUS, barely existing. in fact the checkpoint system borders on glitched. if you complete an objective, you should (and sometimes do) get a checkpoint, many or most times you don't.
- healing system is almost useless, practically broken. this game uses health packs. the problem is that 1 shot (even on the lowest difficulty setting) can equal instant death. if you are lucky, you can try to heal yourself, at which time you may be shot and killed. or, you can try to have someone else heal you - the majority of the time, the guy trying heal me would get shot and killed himself just trying to reach me. realistic? i guess. fun? nope.
- hit detection, hit boxes seem broken with some weapons. i can look through a scope and hit enemies dead-to-rights through the crosshairs, unload entire clips and they simply don't hit the enemy. am i too far away? dunno.

Right now I'm on level 4 and will have to restart the entire mission due to a glitched checkpoint. the game barely has checkpoints to begin with, yet this one has saved right before an automatic mission failure...

In a regular week people come in and send their junk, I mean XBOX, to get fixed and they do it with the return service Microsoft offers, so they don't have to pay anything, after all, they already got robbed with the system, and as I was telling you, in a week we get around 20 to 30 systems to send back, and some people come back to resend the one they already got fixed about 2 or 3 times after the first service. So I have asked people what is the problem with their Xbox, some have told me that I just stop running, others that it burned up after a few hours of game play and my favorite, after having it for 2 months the image is white and black.

What I am traying to say is that do not waste you hard earned cash in junk, get a PS2 OR PS3, if it is in your budget, and enjoy with out the worry of having to get your system fixed after 5 minutes of play time, I have had my ps2 since 2001 and still works great, as my PS3 wich I have had for a year and a half now, and now problems at all even afater 10 hours of play time.

The game is great in terms of graphics.  The sound is amazing.  The movement is suprisingly fast, depending on your connection, but mine is pretty fast.

What makes this game frustrating is that lack of intelligence of those that are playing.  Don't play this game around kids and don't have the blue tooth on.  You'll hear all the cursing and downright raunchy comments made by the guys playing the game.  If you are a novice, like I am, forget it.  I've been ""Voted Out"" by the other players maybe because I wasn't fast enough, or had enough kills and even learning how the game is.  I'm just learning the game.  But, to tell the truth, I don't know if I want to learn the game as much now. Because the levels are just not that interesting.  I like the other games which you had missions to do and you had to converse with your team where to go and what to do.  They did it.  Maybe not right all the time, but you didn't see a whole team running about with no coordination.  Everyone seems to just be going where they please.

This game IS a great idea though.  Connecting players everywhere to play a game.  I just think there are parameters that should be built in the game.  Lose the communication.  Useless.  I've heard nonsense.  One guy was singing a song.  Another bragging that he was high and needed to get more booze so he can get really drunk.  I don't want to hear that.  So, what I found myself doing was leaving the BlueTooth on, and just setting it on the counter so I wouldn't hear all the nonsense.  I turned off the ear piece one time and you can here their stupid comments through the speakers with the rest of the game and my kid was in the room!!

One thing that I wish that this game had was a level of skill where you can join a game on your skill level.  For example, when you connect to a game, it would automatically put you in a game where all players that are of lower rank would play.  If you were a high rank, it would keep you out, because obviously, you don't belong.  Then as you increase your skills, you graduate to another level where you are teamed with guys on that level, and so on.  That would be much better I think.  Because it seems like no matter what skill level you are, you'll be in the mix with guys that play the game together and will actually KILL YOU if you are not up to their standards.

But almost immediately I started having problems with the pedals getting stuck and keep in mind at this point the wheel and pedals haven't been used more than 3 times since I've had them, I had to take apart the pedals and the plastic had cracked so the spring was over to the side making the pedal catch on the plastic, the construction of the pedals is beyond pathetic and a very poor soldering job with the cheapest wire you can find. Since then I've had to take apart the pedals NUMEROUS times to fix and readjust them, the pedals are so lite I've even had to add some heavy bolts as weights to keep them from sliding around on my carpet.

Other complaints I have is that the pedals (aside from being very cheap and too lite) are placed way too closely together, the wheel is only 9"" wide and is very stiff ruining the experience and ofcourse the suction cups however other than that I haven't had any problems with the wheel itself. With the quality of the wheel and pedals I wouldn't pay anymore than $25 for it brand new.

My advice is if you're looking to buy a racing wheel for your kid to play Xbox don't buy this, you'd be better off buying the official Microsoft wheel and be done with it because this one has too many major flaws, it's NOT a great value.

For PC gamers looking for a budget wheel I'd give this a pass, more than likely you're going to want the most realistic racing experience and this can't give you that, for about $150 you can buy a used racing wheel with force feedback, I'm going to try the Driving Force GT because I've read alot of good things about it, it's marketed for PlayStation 3 but has Windows PC drivers to work on PC.",Spend a little more and get quality,1423094400,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Amazon Reviewers love this game so my ranking is going to take a hit but, so be it someone has to state the obvious about this game. As said in the last sentence Amazon reviewers just love this game reason is, they're Inuyasha fans. Don't get me wrong I love Inuyasha and own a collection of the DVD's; I'm just not a blind leader of the hanyou I guess. For some reason the plot gets a lot of praise, I for one have no idea why. Shippou and Kagome fight because... Kagome runs out of snacks, yes folks, the people at Bandai really put their heads together for this plot. Yeah you're collecting shards and yes they have a little explanation before you start fighting, does that really count? That's all from the show, and as soon as the little explanation to you collecting shards is over and you actually start fighting the plot disappears, the story does not unfold at all. This is a fighting game however so bad plot is extremely forgivable. Then there are the controls... which are way too simple. People may list simple controls under the heading of good things about the game but me, not if they're this simple. I've played RPG's with more complex controls. Characters seemed limited with a low number of moves and special moves that are way below spectacular, extremely below. The difficulty of this game is just amazing; buy this game and less than 15 minutes later it's possible to already have beaten the game with at least one character, maybe less than that. Characters look horrible, why wasn't there an Inuyasha game for the PS2 to be brought to our shores? Is this just a game to try and squeeze the PSX for all it's worth?

The story is very-very simple. The game, actually, starts pretty good in terms of story-telling, there is a very interesting cinematic moment that sets up the whole game, but after that moment most of the story is told very briefly through a 1-2 minute long scene that is not even animated, it's just still images with voice-over. I've stopped playing at chapter 5 and the story stopped there. I mean, the first game was not ground-breaking in terms of story and characters, but it was passable. This game - it's simply a repeat of the old formula of a lone wolf, and it's very weird because both heroes are ex-heads of the empire, yet they have no connections, no money and it feels like Emily was not an empress at all.
Characters are all dull and there is no development whatsoever. Dialogue is pretty much shortened to ""you have to sneak there and kill that guy"".

Sound effects and music are quite weak, as well. Voice-over - terrible! The first game actually had a much better cast, but here - no one cares about performance, they just read the lines in ""cool"" voices. And I specifically look at you, the actor of Corvo.

Gameplay is the thing this game gets a lot of praise for. Well, I have to say that it's not as it was advertised. There is certainly no ""choose your way"" of play. Stealth is extremely boring and quick, all-out killing is just dull. The only proper way to enjoy the gameplay is to collect every single rune available on the level (which is too tedious to do since there are tons of them), so you can unlock all the extra abilities, and killing everyone you see from behind. So, there is only one way to enjoy this game and ""choose your way"" is simply a lie.
Speaking of killing, this game has a very weird moral system, which basically encourages you to NOT kill anybody, yet the game throws all these various items, techniques of killing without introducing anything interesting in terms of ""veggie"" play. So, if you like to get good endings, prepare for a boring gameplay.

Controls on PS4 are very bad. I mean, really. It is too hard to get used to them, so when you end up in a fight, you lose not because you did something wrong but because you're fighting with both the enemy and the control system. This game can only be enjoyed with a keyboard, and that's it. There is no way around it.

Graphics are kind of terrible. The art-style from the first game is present here, but it doesn't work. Mainly, because in the first one pretty much each level was crafted with the art-style in mind, in this game I completed 5 chapters and only one level actually worked well with the art-style, the others - just bleak and dull. And remember how much developers talked about whales in this game? I've only seen one. Yeah.
Not to mention that after all the patches, the game still performs terrible on a Slim PS4. There is constant drop of frame-rate in big locations and my question is: if huge games with a ton of detail like GTA 5 and Uncharted 4 work well on any PS4, why is this game so terrible and laggy?

Lastly, the AI. It's laughable. I played on a medium difficulty and the guards wouldn't see me when I was standing right next to them, they're just stupid. And let me give you another example. In the first chapter I entered some house, I look through the lock to see if there are any guards in the next room and I see one walking in circles with one of his legs inside a bath bowl. So, he walks and drags that bowl with him while saying something. It was ridiculous.

I am giving this game 1 star out of 5. It is an absolute garbage with no interesting story, characters, with a dull and stupid gameplay and horrible, absolutely horrible voice-over. I really hope these actors will never ever give their voice to any character.

Also when I disconnect it and then reconnect it sometimes the mouse cursor does not not move but the buttons still work. I have configured all my profiles. Just so I know it is not my profiles after disconnecting this 2 or 3 times the cursor will start moving finally.

Also I am using this on a Razer Exactmat so I know it isn't the mouse pad.

NO!

This game was ultimately disappointing. Though It had the great addition of a cut scene menu, it was all prewritten so there is nothing new. The game play had a lot of possibility, but they stuck with the GBA controls. If you have played the original game Chain of Memories there is nothing new to expect. You will constantly find your self beating a really easy boss to go back to the main story and fight an impossibly hard boss. The lags of card reloading is annoying and pointless. In fact you will find the original game Chain of Memories more entertaining. If they were looking for improvement when they decided to do a remake they could have got rid of the annoying card system. There is an unlockable game called reverse rebirth where you can play as Sora's friend Riku, that game is ages better then the main story how ever you will find every thing to be the same in every level. You are very limited to cards which is really dissapointing considering it's the whole point of the battle system. other wise it is just a Kingdom Hearts Collectible.

Some are good, but few know about them, such as Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain (one of my favorites). Some are good, and everyone who knows the genre exists knows the game, such as Master of Orion 2. Some are just colasal flops, and usually for many different reasons.
Do I have experience enough to judge a good 4X game? Well, I have played many of the games, but some disagree with my views on them. Here are the ones I have. My all time favorite, Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain; Master of Orion 2, one of my less favorites; Space Empires 4, in the middle of my list; Conquest: Frontier Wars gets second place; Star Wars: Rebelion, had potental, but didn't quite deliver; Star Trek: Birth of the Federation, also had potential, but didn't quite deliver. And that's all I can think of right now.
Anyway, on to Master of Orion 3. The prequel, MoO2 was many people's favorite, and it was good for when it came out (though I prefered Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain), but I wasn't one of it's biggest fans. Now MoO3 is a different story. I didn't actually buy it mind you. I got the full version 60 minute demo, and it was terrible. Although better visually than most, the menus and selection are very poorly done and getting anything done is nearly impossible. I didn't see the battles, but that makes no difference if the main interface is so bad you can't get anything done. There is little helpful information for running your empire.
All-in-all, this game isn't worth the time of day. If you want a 4X game, I reccomend getting Conquest:Frontier Wars, MoO2, or Space Empires 4. I haven't tried Galactic Empires yet, but it looks cool, so that could be a possibility. But this isn't the game that you are looking for. So hit the back button, and move on.

In fact it has been indirectly marketed as the ""spiritual successor"" of DK, even the game publishers have made this claim during devlopment.

First off the game is not good even if your not expecting DK, so be smart and find a demo before getting your wallet out

Second, be aware that the game is sort of like a tower defense game in that enemies just pour into your area and try to steal gold and leave..and your on an invisible timer. Your monsters sit there not moving until an enemy comes near, they clash, and if your monsters win they go right back to standing in place, just like a tower in a tower defense game

Third, it is a shallow theme park game, most of the decor is worthless and bland, and placing it inside your dungeon is not anything close to fun

Four, your dungoen lord and his main goblin minion are CLONES of the game Overlord..it is shameful and highlights how worthless the game really is

And lastly: why does the game try so hard to force you to use the dungeon lord to kill invading heroes? You should be free to play the way you see fit. Bad feature

My hope is that either mods or patches (or both) can fix this steamer

All said, the game itself was an obvious trap for impulsive gamers, don't fall for it

Let me add: Yes I own the full game

And after severla hours of playing this game trying to see some positives, I am still at a loss:

If you try to be creative at all with your layout, you end up killing yourself in the end, because the game is once again, more like a tower defense game than anything else, and you have to plan for the time when you'll have 10-15 enemies walking around inside your area

Skills are not very impressive

Hero levels go up on a timer, which adds to the tower defense feel

Like other Resident Evil games it relies on shock and jump scares to scare players. It works for a duration but eventually you become numb to it. It started to feel more like an action game with the hordes of enemies it starts to throw at you in the later chapters. Now blowing off the heads of zombies is fun, don't get me wrong, but add on to the zombie killing clunky controls and bad camera angles where things like bushes totally block your view, and you start to wonder what this game is even trying to be. If you're playing an action game, smooth controls is an absolute must. Clunky controls work well for a survival horror because it makes it harder to retreat but it fails as a survival horror when there's a million horrors coming after you. A successful horror game keeps you guessing the unknown, not just throwing hordes of enemies at you. So, simply put, this game just does not know what it wants to be. It's trying to be two things at once which is totally stupid. If I wanted to play an action game with monsters I would just go play Modern Warfare zombies.

There's simply no way to get pass other civs borders unless you declare war to them, so if one of your units gets stuck between AI borders your only option if to delete it if you don't want to declare them war. Diplomacy is non-existance. I don't even think this game have diplomacy. The AI only talked to me the first time I met them and when they decided to declare me war for stupid reasons. That's it. It feels as if other civs don't exist in this game, you don't feel them, is like you are alone in the world and those other civs are there just to block your pathway. The map is very small. The game pace is always quick. No custom settings. You just choose yor civ and start a game.

It does have some nice things that Civ VI will implement like forming a division with three units and the way cities look in this game is similar to how they will look in Civ VI. I also like how some civs have more than two unique units. But that's about it.

This game feels like it was made for mobile devices and also children. Is too easy. Everything is automatic. And there is no strategy involved. Keep spawing warriors and conquest the whole world in a few turns. I only played one game and I didn't even finish it. I expected more from a Civ game.

tl;dr - If you have never played another Civ game you may like this but if you played at least V then this game will be unplayable.",Not what I expected,1466208000,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

Original review Below:

The games not bad, and if i hadn't played the PS3 versions I would probably be nicer. That said, the game feels like a very expensive vita advertisement.  The story is OK, nothing special, but does the trick and keeps the game going forward.  The problem is all the writing and game play stuff feels like its simply implemented to make sure the Vita new Tech is being used.  The end result is a ton of mini games that make what I consider on the PS3 to be a nice mature game, to be dumbed down to quicktime events and little kid puzzles.

The Good:
*Graphics look really nice.
*Voice acting is as good as always
*The jumping/climbing fun that is expected is there.

Bad:
*Vita specific mini games that take you out of the game all the time.
*Difficulty Spikes that feel like sloppy planning rather then a challenge.
*No real boss fights, and the only two fights that exist are Quicktime events!!!
*Rope climbing is designed to use the vita touch back screen but it's wonky, so they also put in normal button as well.  end result you just go up and down on the rope for a while.

The Blah:
*Puzzles: which are more like rub this or line this picture up so it looks nice. Not horrible for a few of them, but you do it for the whole game.  it gets a bit repetitive.
* The story, if drake and Sulli weren't in the game, I wouldn't have cared for any of them.
*The Camera during the climbing parts is stiff, where's the ""Oh S***"" parts that the PS3 counter parts have.

Conclusion:
because the Vita is currently lacking in games its worth it for about 20 or so.  I do want to conclude that it's fun to see what the Vita can physically do, i just wish it wasn't forced upon you, but rather the natural choice.  Heavy Rain a quicktime only game feels right because each action that you do seems like a form of what the characters are actual doing on screen, but these quicktime events feel more like 'look what the vita can do,' rather then having any real purpose.",Vita Advertisment?

It still sucked, but I would be lying if I didn't find it to be an awesome experience.  For starters the roster is all has-beens and never gonna be's.  So jogging up a few memories of grapplers that the world forgot was pretty awesome, the fact these dudes were ever in a video game should baffle any wrestling fan.  The game is a bad as the shows presentation-wise from that era.  Its gloomy, dark and devoid of interest.  Best of all is the commentary by Bobby Heenan and Tony Schavonie or however you spell his name.  It's sometimes repetitive but even in that sense its pretty much on the mark.  Heenan can't even talk like this anymore.  Its like a blast from the past.  You will find the game play easy, but the engagement on the screen to be pretty terrible but still.  In the overall picture you will get your WCW fix and feel like you just watched a horrible WCW episode which if you ever saw one now, would probably bring back some semblance of your youth.

2.0,False,"05 29, 2005",A1L1MOPWAYPKJU,B0007LWMRG,Sean May,"Imperial Glory suffers from one major flaw: It tries to be 3 games at once. First, let's look at the most hyped aspect of the game; the real-time battle engine. It is much like those found in the Total War series, but is not as effective. In Rome: Total War, the game really gave you a feeling that there were thousands of individual men fighting the battle, but the engine in Imperial Glory makes it feel like you're pushing around a very sluggish single unit. Also, there is no real reason to build any infantry units during the game. In my experience, if you rushed a couple of units of militia (the ""weakest"" units in the game), you could trample any army. I was frequently defeated, even when I outnumbered the enemy by two or three, and most of their units were milita.

The second game Imperial Glory tries to be is a world simulator like Civilization 3. It also fails on this base greatly. No matter how mighty and far-reaching your empire is, you are still scraping by with the tiny numbers of resources at your disposal. The diplomatic model functions, but there is very little personality to it. Resource trading is awful, as countries will more than likely never accept your generous offers of raw materials for gold, but on their turn offer you the same. If you reject this country's offer, your overall standing with the country goes down, sometimes even forcing you into war. The game also features a fairly robust tech tree, and it is probably the best aspect of the game. The game also features ""quests"". These quests are more or less like the Wonders you construct in games like Civ 3 or Rise of Nations, and they give you similar results. The only problem with them is that by completing them, you burn off a great majority of the few resources you have.

The third game Imperial Glory attempts at is a naval warfare simulator. It plays out much, much slower than the combat found in the wonderful Sid Meier's Pirates!, and it is simply not fun. It has some good features, but the combat is far too slow to enjoy them. Also, the enemy seems to have an advantage on the seas. For some reason, I had two ships in pursuit of an enemy ship, and in one salvo, both ships were blown apart by enemy fire. This is neither fair or realistic.

 Finally, we come to the worst part of Imperial Glory. This game is touted as a simulation of the national and political turmoil of the early 19th century, with epic wars being fought on all fronts, but it has one major flaw.....

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FIGHT A SINGLE BATTLE TO WIN THE GAME.

The game has a concept called ""peaceful annexation"". This means that if you throw enough money to a country, they will quickly and quietly become part of your empire. I played the game for a little over 10 game years (each turn is a month, so 120 turns), and I never, ever had a battle. Ever. I never even had the slightest threat of battle until I kept making countries mad by proposing resource deals. That's right, the game can go on without a single battle on your side and you can still win the game. This makes the game very dull and it forces the game to neglect it's much-touted 3d battle engine.

In conclusion, if you played the demo of the game, please understand that actual fighting is about 10% of the game, and most of the game is spent looking at a board, waiting to get enough resources to build a small army that will soon be destroyed by men who do not even use guns","Tries to be everything, fails to be much at all",1117324800,5,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

The best label for the gameplay is a cocktail that blends Pilotwings with Gran Turismo's license tests: Hurtling along preset paths, you must guide a vehicle through a precise series of jumps, swerves, and other hair-raising maneuvers. The requirements for success are unforgiving and demanding; if you lag behind even slightly or deviate from the path in the smallest way, it's stunt over, and you have to start again from the beginning (apparently, the directors of these films don't edit). As a result, this game is truly very hard, and the absence of difficulty levels or even checkpoints means no mercy for less-hardcore gamers looking for a break. Basically, Stuntman is about being perfect-and incessantly repeating a stunt until, at long last, you get it exactly right. Adding to the frustration, the game's physics sometimes feel wrong: Your car will often wreck in goofy, weird ways; fences that break in some places are impenetrable barriers in others; and the like.  If all that doesn't turn you off, bump the Fun Factor up to 4.0 because Stuntman deserves major props for its unique concept and thrilling stunts. The buzz of jumping a car over a moving train, whipping it past exploding gas stations, and then burning nitro to soar over a river just can't be denied. When you complete all the stunts for a film, you're rewarded with the trailer, which is a series of cinematics spliced with the stunts you performed-and that's just way cool. The game also supplies an awesome stunt constructor, which lets you create the craziest set of ramps, barriers, and obstacles you can conjure up, then attempt to survive it in the cars you've unlocked. Instead of that mode, though, what Stuntman badly needs is a practice mode where you could take your time and master the stunts. After all, don't real-life stuntman get to practice-or at least get a peek at a map-before the cameras roll? In the absence of those aids, your frustration will rapidly boil over as you struggle more to learn than to execute. In a delicious bit of irony, at one point a cinematic tells you that supercomputers have been used to model the precise speed you should hit a jump...but that speed is never revealed to you!  If you're the sort who likes to crack a tough nut, Stuntman has a pair cast in titanium. It's definitely not for everyone, but for the right gamer who can tolerate its flaws and appreciate its rigorous challenges, it's gold.

I've been playing this for over a month and to be honest after the island and barber shop were locked, everything just became so mundane and ultimately boring.  I also have the not-so-uncommon luck of scoring a large percentage of ugly and rude NPC villagers. You can have only up to 10 animal villagers, the last of which can only be invited at the camp site after it's built. My villagers tend to be rude, calling me bad names and often criticizing me for being fat. I wonder if the dialogs were lost in translation.

2.0,True,"10 9, 2013",A3URVWPFJOHT72,B009791CW0,zlionsfan,"Sports games are, in some ways, the most difficult games to create, not because of the size of the world or the number of playable characters or what have you, but because unlike most other games, the world sports games attempt to recreate is familiar to all and is known in great detail, particularly for a sport like baseball. It's not difficult for even casual fans to check major details, and a dedicated fan can check things like single-season records or player career totals, so while you may have flexibility in the choices you give to players, the world you put them in is defined for you, and your job is to render it accurately.

Something like 75% of this game is done with the care and detail that should be expected from an officially-licensed game: real teams playing in real parks (uh, mostly, although some features are mislabeled because they couldn't get the license or didn't want to pay for it, like the GM fountain in Comerica), infielders shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot as you circle the bases, baserunners flexing their hands as they take their leads ... lots of little details make you feel like you're part of an authentic MLB game.

The other 25%, though ... either the playtesters were dismissed early or the project manager just ignored what they had to say, because the game is full of flaws that yank you roughly out of any immersion you may be feeling and remind you that you're playing a poorly-designed, poorly-developed game. The game is mostly free of game-breaking bugs, although I did have a series of crashes over the course of a few days, and there was one particularly amusing training session where I was hitting in provided situations, and the ball rebounded off the cage and out between the mound and home plate, so the pitcher was holding out his hand for the ball and the catcher refused to get it because it wasn't supposed to be there.

The blown details, on the other hand, are impossible to miss. Watch the line score in Road To The Show: sometimes the inning-by-inning scores are put up as they happen, sometimes they don't show up until the inning is over, sometimes the zero shows up in the middle of the inning. The W-L record and ERA of the visiting team's pitcher is always 0-0 and 0.00; the home team's pitcher is always shown with 0 strikeouts. Here's a grounder to second for a fielder's choice, with the relay to first for the double play. (That's not a FC. A FC is a force of another runner when the batter reaches base; a double play is not a FC.) Or play one of the training sessions, where the result of each play or swing or pitch is shown, except when it's not, and the goal for each play is clear, except when it's not, and the results of each play are right, except when they're not. Throwing Decisions, for example, are only credited when you pre-select the base you're throwing to, so even if you make the ""correct"" decision, if you didn't do it early enough, it doesn't count. ""Correct"" is in quotes because what the game is expecting is not what people who've actually played the game would do in a particular situation, especially if you don't get any guidance from your manager. Bases loaded, 1 out, where are you going to throw the ball? If you said ""home"", you're wrong, because ... well, it doesn't tell you why. It just says that trying to stop the run from scoring is a bad decision. First and third with 2 out? Don't throw to first, that's a bad decision. Give me a break.

Just as fun is getting a Steal 2B session when you're a corner infielder with middling speed. Not fast enough to steal? Too bad. Sure, you could get a fielding session instead - although I went nearly an entire season as a 3B without getting anything fielding-related - but why not train you in something that you don't really need yet? Never mind that it isn't actually Stealing 2B, but rather Steal 2B By Getting A Good Jump. If you leave early, but you end up getting to 2B anyway, it doesn't count, because that's not how they wanted you to do it.

The post-play animations are kind of silly as well: your infielder insists on running off the field after an out, even if there were less than 2 outs. (And even if you're in training. What?) Of course, that's not really that important, because it's just for show. What is important is the incredibly stupid camera movement during play. This is actually common to all be-the-player games, the over-the-shoulder camera that always moves on its own and never lets you change it, but it's a real problem in this game when it comes to defense. Runners at 1st and 2nd, none out, ground ball to you at third, what do you do? In real life, you'd step on the bag. In MLB 13, you can't do that, because as soon as you pick up the ball, the camera spins to show you where it thinks you should throw the ball, and if you try to run to a base, it basically circles behind you, making you the drunk guy on the corner. Of course you could just press a button to run to the base ... except there's no way to do that. So there's no way to get the lead runner in that situation ... and worse yet, if you don't decide on a base, the game will start you running to where the play should be, and of course with somewhat-realistic physics, if you want to throw the ball, you have to set your feet, so instead of letting you stop and think what to do, it can actually prevent you from making a play.

The other thing that presumably prevents you from making plays is the RPG aspect of this mode. It totally makes sense that for, say, baserunning skill to mean anything, if it's low, you have to struggle to run the bases, but it would be so much more helpful to have an icon flash on the screen when you try to round first on a line drive to the gap and your stupid player stops because second base is so far away or something like that. (It's worse when you're the lead runner and you end up backing up the other runners.) Without that feedback, there's no way to tell if you're doing something wrong, if there's a bug in the game, or if it's just because you're not good at running the bases. Speaking of baserunning ... what's more fun than having your player suddenly take off for home while the pitcher has the ball in his hand? It took several occurrences and a quick check of the settings for me to get that I wasn't doing it, say by touching the back screen (the default setting for that is disabled anyway), and you can learn to press X to stop your runner and move the stick down to get him back on base, but again, without something to tell you ""your player is doing this because baserunning aggressiveness is too low"" or whatever, it might as well be a bug.

The manager doesn't make too many odd decisions, although he does insist on putting you behind the plate on rare occasions even if you don't have any catching experience. Fortunately, it does know not to put right-handed fielders at first ... oh, actually it doesn't. I've been inserted as a PH and then left at both 1B and 2B with a right-handed player. I know these modes tend to get you more action than you would as a normal player, but a right-handed 3B should be at LF, maybe RF if he has a good arm, and that's it.

He doesn't make too many in-game suggestions, either. You'll get direction to play in, shade the line, or shift left or right for pull hitters (and I assume DP depth for 2B and SS), but on offense, nothing. No bunt sign, no hit-and-run sign, no steal sign. (There are 1B and 3B coaches, but they just give you stop and go signs when the ball is live.)

There's more - and this is just from RttS mode, as I don't typically play the other modes - but I think you get the idea. If you're the type of person who doesn't mind nagging little bugs, then you'll probably have a good time with this game. If what you're looking for is a game that nails the picky little details as well as the overall game ... you're out of luck.","So much promise, so little delivery",1381276800,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation Vita'},

I read reviews before I bought it about how it was a major improvment over the first one but I just don't see it. You complete missions similar to the first one. Parts of the game are very slow paced such as having to follow someone to a destination,I carried a crate or box or something of that nature to a destination and put it down on the ground,where is the challenge in that. I will continue to play it and try to get into it and get used to the controls. I still have trouble when climbing a building,I try to jump up but for some reason I jump back and fall and die. Maybe I just haven't played enough of it yet.

Update 10/8/11:I have just completed the game and it was better than I first thought and it was better than the first one as well,but still not quite what I expected. Fighting and defeating major enemies is very easy,while solving puzzles and riddles is quite difficult at times. I like that I could swim this time instead of drowning and getting desynchronized as in the first one. I was able to get used to the controls and learned to jump up onto buildings and ledges. The ending to the game was better than the first but still a little difficult to understand. Overall I give this game 3 out of 5 stars.

First, as a video game, Acme Arsenal is just a generic third-person shooter with a Looney Tunes look. You might as well be playing Tomb Raider. The game fails to capture the essence of Looney Tunes humor. Instead, you fight robots. Lots and lots of robots. Over and over again.

It should also be stated that the two-player split-screen mode was a really poor choice by the designers. As other reviewers have noted, the separate views for each player make it very easy for players to get separated. Furthermore the camera that follows your character is not very smart, so with only 1/2 of the screen, you will frequently find yourself in positions where you can't see the object onto which you need to jump.

Finally, as a ""Wii"" game, this is utterly uninspired. You twist and shake the controllers to perform attacks, but this is not any improvement over mashing button combinations. The movements are not natural or intuitive or fun.

These were some of the best sounding ones, on par with my astro a50s. I really like the leather ear cups and all of the options to hook up to. I can use them with my phone via bluetooth or through the onboard jack and then I can use optical or aux or even usb when the base station is attached. Awesome; I love having lots of inputs. The mic sounds clear and crisp. The battery life is okayish. It's not bad but could be better. The Bluetooth quality is good. The onboard controls are useful and easy to access without taking the headset off.

GOOD:
Sound great
Good mic
Inputs galore
Easy to use controls when it is on your head.
Great wireless range

Now it has a few flaws, one being pretty much a dealbreaker:

There is no onboard easy to access USB that charges the headphones. I have a headset hanger under my desk where most of my headsets sit and there are a bunch of usb cables going there to charge the headphones when they aren't being used. The 840s don't have that option. There is a USB port under one of the ear cups but I don't know what that does and it is not convenient to access.

The base station's inputs are not desirable. I can't plug in a cable from my base station to my pc and use it as a communication channel for software like discord. The inputs simply do not allow it. You need to have the headset connected via its onboard chat port effectively making them wired.
The USB input is significantly quieter than any of the other inputs and at times there is a high frequency buzz in one of the earcups. They say it is not optimal to use USB for audio but that's them justifying the absolutely horrid DAC they used in the base station. I recommend getting an external soundcard with an optical port for the best sound quality.

The dealbreaker:
This is the most uncomfortable headset I have ever used. By far.  They are heavy and the top headband is not padded enough and the padding isn't continuous. After about an hour or so, the discomfort on top of my head turned into pain. Next is the horrible ear padding. The cups themselves are padded well but the inner orange layer is sooooo thin that wearing these headphones the way over-the-ears should be worn cause your earlobes to be pushed up against the hard plastic speaker grill and it starts hurting after a while as well. A small circular padded piece under the earcups may fix this but it should be like that from factory. Finally the clamping force is horrendous. Let me start this off by saying my head is average sized. I assume they have such a powerful clamping force because they are heavy and need to stay firmly on your head but boy oh boy is it painful after a while. It is even difficult to try and spread them with your hands. I wore these for about 45 minutes right before writing this review and had such a massive headache when I started typing that I resorted to taking off the headset and spreading it over a can of wet wipes to hopefully weaken their clamping force a bit.

Conclusion:  While these cost $300+, I do not recommend them. They are far too uncomfortable to be useful for any period of time. If they get some upgrade making them bearable to wear OR their price drops down to $200 or less, then I would recommend them.  As of now though, the Astro A40s with a mixamp is the best option out there for this price range.",One of the better headsets but definitely not the best,1483401600,,{'Style:': ' Siberia 840'},

RE 4 was an amazing game, and I even enjoyed RE 5.  But by the time I bought RE 6 for the low, low price of $9 new, I had already heard all the critiques about it being too far of a departure from the things that made the series great.  So it was hard not to jump into it without some major bias.  Heres what I found from my experience with the game:

PROS

-Looks pretty good on the Xbox360, a last gen system.

-A wide variety of characters to play, with multiple missions for each.

-Player models are detailed and interesting.

-For the most part, weapon controls are tight and responsive.

-Nice execution of the standard arrangement of weapons and inventory items.

-Some of the sequences are challenging in an exciting way.

-While most of the chapters are action oriented, a few lean more towards the survival-horror we love.

-A decent, cohesive story consistent with the crazy stuff that goes on in the RE universe.

-The total game length is decent.

CONS

-Your characters, the highly trained operatives that they are, will spend a lot of time during cutscenes standing around with their thumbs up their tailpipes watching really bad things happen to their friends and allies.  Seriously, they stand frozen, gnashing their teeth melodramatically when we all know they could whip out a gun and place a shot between the bad guys eyes faster than we can hit the skip cutscene button.  Now I know this is done intentionally as part of the story so things can unfold the way the designers imagined, but in my opinion it is really weak storytelling and an extremely frustrating way to eject the player from their immersion in the story.

-While part of the series charm has been the over-the-top acting, I personally have never cared for it muchespecially given the very adult themes at play.  While RE6 isn't the worst offender in the series, theres plenty of it on display here.  The Last of Us is a far better example of how all of these genres and tropes can be brought together in a way that doesnt feel like it was written by a 14 year-old.

-I really hope that Quick Time Events die in a horrible, flaming death.  Likewise, whoever invented them should have to write Im sorry I invented QTEs on the chalkboard a million times.  Seriously, developers need to band together and pledge that they will never ever put QTEs in their games again.

-Progressing through the upgrade system is slow and will require multiple playthroughs to unlock.  Considering it was a chore just to play through the game even once, its unlikely Ill ever pursue unlocking them all.

I hate to say it, but by the end of RE6, I didn't even feel that the game was a good way to spend my time.  Granted, I felt compelled to finish it since I actually paid for it, but thats a bad reason to do something.  And its not that the game was absolutely horrible.  Its just that everything good was brutally cancelled out by something equally frustrating.  It became a slog very early on and before long all I was focused on was finishing the game rather than enjoying it.

I really hope that the RE series loops around and returns to some of the things that made it interesting in the first place.  RE: Revelations was a much more enjoyable game, played much more like RE 4, and signals that it is possible for the developers to do so.

So while others may have enjoyed RE6, I simply cant recommend it.  Its better to spend your time playing a decent game like RE: Revelations or one of the recent Silent Hill entries if you're looking for something in the survival-horror genre.

2.0,False,"03 11, 2016",A2C05OHYJERICI,B00IQCRKW0,Michael Haywood,"I think the biggest flaw of the game is that they focused far too much on the Batmobile and not enough on the open world. Everything you do in-game revolves around your vehicle, So much so that you will spend roughly 65% of the campaign inside of it. They have pretty much stripped the open world/exploring part of this game and replaced it with a vehicle that suffers from poor controls and just doesn't look that good.

Then again, The whole game doesn't look that good either. It's a painfully dark and poor mess that just fails to impress like previous Arkham games. The scarecrow is the main villain and he's just sort of eh. The Arkham Knight was a great potential villain that is teased through out the whole game as Batman's equal with some obvious past history between him and the dark knight. In the end, You don't even fight. The boss battle is all about stealth and it's just an awful disappointment considering how much potential he had as a villain.

And then we move onto similar issues with what Arkham City had. They try to cram in a lot of popular villains and it just doesn't really work. I loved what they did with Man-Bat and Firefly, That showed potential. I think they'd be better off focusing on 3 villains and giving them a story arc that spans several missions instead of trying to cram 5-7 villains into several short and boring missions. And least we forget all the lovely bugs and glitches that the game still suffers from despite several patches, That's disappointing as well.

Overall, I enjoyed AK for the most part, Certainly more so than Arkham Origins. I just don't think the potential was fully used. They don't make use of the graphics despite being the first Arkham game on a next gen system. They also focus far too much on the Batmobile instead of crafting the open world that we are so use to playing and exploring. It just leads to a lot of lack luster and boring game play.

2.0,False,"10 18, 2005",A3PQQERLSN0MQG,B0000645ZH,Edmund Khoo,"Despite several conspicuous flaws, Codemasters' Project IGI 2 (Im Going In) is a reasonable 1st person shooter with an emphasis on stealth. While the storyline is disjointed and at times incredibly clich, in a 1st person shooter the plot often plays second fiddle to gameplay, and it is in this area that IGI 2 is strongest, though certainly not groundbreaking or incredibly entertaining.

The premise is simple. Ex SAS operative David Jones, working for the mysterious (and fictional) ""Institute for Geotactical Intelligence"" must sneak his way through a variety of different levels, naturally accomplishing objectives ranging from sabotage to infiltration.

As a stealth shooter, David Jones must be navigated through a series of extremely large levels, disabling guards and infiltrating deep into facilities. With such large, sprawling levels, loading times are long, and it often takes more than an hour to complete a single mission. The game features the usual assortment of weaponry, all of which sound suitably powerful, though often most of the level will pass without issuing a single unsilenced shot. While all this may seem terribly suspenseful and interesting, several flaws greatly detract from what could have been a great gaming experience.

Firstly, the lack of a proper savegame feature prevents players from saving until the end of a level, which can be frustrating, especially when a single alarm usually results in an unrelenting storm of hostile enemies. Secondly, there is little in the game to justify any other weapon than the silenced pistol. Hideously overpowered, the pistol is just as powerful as a submachine gun, possesses greater range than a rifle, and, when fired, does not kick. Since many of the other weapons are not fitted with silencers, most of the levels can be completed with the aforementioned handgun rather than its more powerful counterparts.

Thirdly, the enemy is unbelievably accurate. There are few situations more infuriating than coming a few minutes from the end of a mission and being taken down by a few highly precise submachine gun rounds, thus forcing you to restart the level again. Likewise, it is incredibly irritating when, after having guided David Jones to hide behind a conveniently placed tree, the enemy lets loose a few rounds that pass through the trunk to eliminate the unfortunate operative, much to my chagrin. The game thus evolves into one in which David Jones must crawl from shrub to shrub, snapping off a few well placed shots and generally attempting to escape detection.

On a more positive note, the music is suitably suspenseful, and the voice acting is generally very sound.

In conclusion, Project IGI 2 is at best a mediocre 1st person shooter. The lack of a proper savegame function, a palette of boring brown/grey visuals, long loading times and several flaws in gameplay culminate in a frequently exasperating gaming experience. For every sense of satisfaction after a completed mission, I experienced episodes of intense frustration.",Mediocre at Best,1129593600,,,

2.0,False,"12 26, 2007",A1ARIIDS0IPYLC,B000QB058U,Jeremy Deats,"So Blizzard has made more money off World Of Warcraft than any game in history and the former Diablo II team members who did not move over to work on World of Warcraft left to form ArenaNet and make Guild Wars (an excellent series of game I might add), pretty much the rest of that team later left Blizzard to form Flagship Studios and to make their vision of what Diablo 3 should have been and that game is Hellgate: London.

So how is it? If you liked Diablo 2, it won't take much, the controls will take some getting use to, but the concepts and even a lot of the UI look from Diablo II has carried over here. This is all good, except that the genre has really innovated beyond Diablo 2. Since it appears Diablo 2 will never get a real successor, I would say Guild Wars which came out in 2005 (still alive and relevant today through an expansion and new campaigns) is as good as you can get and it really improved upon several of Diablo's flaws.

Hellgate feels a lot like Diablo 2, but it also feels dated. The graphics  just a touch sub-par for their system requirements I would say and overall there's just a feeling that the game was rushed. It feels like you're playing a beta product. The voice overs often seem misplaced and plan bad. The map has no compass and reviewing your quest log is a bit of a hassle. The control is tight, but you can be running fine at 60fps and get mobbed my enemies and drop down to 10fps. The problem I have against Hellgate is a collection of little things that add up to make it overall far short of the fantastic title it could have been.

You would think at least they got the multi-player part right, but they did not.. and they want to charge for a guild and basic multi-player ideas that are available free in other games.

Having said that, if you skip newer games like Guild Wars and go from into Hellgate from (the now very old) Diablo 2, you probably won't realize what all you're missing and may enjoy it a great deal more than I have so far.

Since I'm not a golfer (or game golfer), it took me about a week to get comfortable with the game functions -- after that, I found myself playing close to PAR on the course.  I think that's a pretty good achievement.  Unlike the other reviewer here, I found the putting system to be do-able.  The difficulty with the game is that there is no margin for error, and thus, no margin for success.

I've played the same course, over and over, versus the computer's first opponent persona ""Killer Miller"" and he...always...beats me.  There is no way to change the AI skillset to at least allow you to edge out the AI.  As a result, the game leaves me very bitter.  Perhaps I am imagining it, but I swear that at times, I am _not_ making a hook as I tee off, but the ball hooks anyway -- often at times which pulls me back from the lead over the computer.  Things like that, and the inability to dumb down the computer a bit -- have made me abandon the game.  I turn off the sexy bits (which originally lured me to buy the game) because I want to get through the game as quickly as I can!!!

The game has other drawbacks -- the load times are stupid long.  It's unbelievable how much loading goes on in an average hour's worth of gameplay (one ""tour"" course).  The game has a funny, edgy sense of humor -- the soundtrack is fun -- but the lack of control over the computer skillset ultimately made me walk away from the game, throwing my PS2 Controller down (instead of my putter).

It's a handheld title that rivals its console brethren on most levels, namely sound, graphics and content. If you've played an Assassin's Creed game before, this experience is not far different from games in the past and you'll quickly find yourself running, traversing and assassinating enemies with the familiar tools of the trade. For brief sections, this game is a lot of fun and exactly what an Assassin's Creed fan would want from a handheld Assassin's Creed game.

Unfortunately, the development team behind Liberation found it necessary to fill the game with Vita-specific gimmicks that aren't intuitive enough or don't work as well as they should in concept. These include tilting and turning the system to complete various puzzles, rubbing two fingers across both touch screens similar to ripping open an envelope and holding the camera up to a light source to reveal mission-specific secrets. These moments will quickly sour your experience because they are light on instructions, tricky to master, and often don't work. With the number of times you'll have to restart sections or redo certain puzzles, you'll begin to question whether this shortcoming is an issue with the Vita's hardware or sloppy tech poorly implemented by Ubisoft. Besides the newly introduced mechanics, Liberation does find itself with the same issues that previous Assassin's Creed games have had as well. The parkour elements of the game (running, climbing, jumping from rooftop to rooftop) are all there in their same glitchy glory and are just as infuriating and frustrating as their console counterparts.

In short, there are multiple 5 to 10 minute sections of Liberation that feel great, are quick and responsive and work just like you would expect them to. Sadly, though, there are even more elongated sections of this game that will make you want to turn your system off and never turn it back on again.",An exercise in frustration set in 18th century New Orleans,1355011200,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Customizing the Sims is fun. A great deal has already been said about creation so I won't add to that. There is a decent variety of clothing. Eventually you will find many of your Sims wearing similar clothes because you can pick out multiple outfits for them. As I like a certain look, it gets repeated often.

Load times are quick. Im running it on a Windows 7 system and find the load times acceptable.

CONS: It has been one glitch after another. I could care less about the loss of toddlers. They were the most difficult to care for anyway. Im happy they added pools. But what would make me really happy is not to have to go from one issue to the next. First it seemed that the game crashed constantly. Ive never had a Sims game crash this much. Move a Sim into a new home. Crash! Try to save a game. Crash! Try to exit to the neighborhood. Crash! Okay. Then that was fixed to a certain extent. Then I couldn't get it to shut down. That was fixed. Then Sims couldn't get food from the fridge without forgetting everything in their queue. Last week, I created a Sim using a Sim Id created previously in CAS. I changed his name, personality, eye color, hair color and hair style. Who knew that this would cause his alter ego (who was now an elder) to disappear altogether and be replaced by him? My new Sim was at once a new person and the old Sim. He was sort of in the old house with a grayed out picture and his wife was in love with him. And he was in the new home where he did not know anyone and was not married. And now I cant play at all. I click on a house and it acts like its going to load only to put me back at the neighborhood screen.

There are minor details that are so annoying. When Sims marry their last name doesnt change. And the person they marry doesnt move into the house. You have to go to the neighborhood screen to move them. (And probably initiating a crash.) Throwing parties is a chore since you have a specific set of goals to achieve to make the party a success. There are a limited number of lots and Maxis filled many of them with expensive homes your Sims won't be able to afford right away. I could go on with the issues

These took me a few moments to figure out, it has a mute button and a dial for volume.

Cons:
The dial eventually goes down drastically when you move. Very fixable with electrical tape.

The ears cups are a little on the smaller side, so if you have larger ears it might be bit uncomfortable. Comparing them to the TRIGGERS.

Pros: They have a cool color stripe thing, aesthetics are nice, guys.
The audio is pretty great for the price of these, I'm very happy. I played Siege with them and could hear my enemies moving around very clearly.

1) Linearity
It's just one mission after another w/ lots of left-click, left-click, and occational right-click.  In many places, there's a little dungeon you can go but u can easily explore that in 1 minute and move on.  Just after Act 2.. I didn't really have any inspiration to move on

2) Too much items / stupid coin chase
After playing just 1 hour..and I had to sell bunch a crap to clear out the inventory.  Just seemed more annoying.  Also, coin chase is so dumb.. is this a Mario game? just give me gold after a kill or something.  Destroying a barrel or rock and getting a gold seems really stupid.  Really? Also, after selling 50 items..you can only afford 1 weapon items.. yeah.. something isn't right here.  I never had to buy anything from shop as I'll find something better in next 10 minute of playing.

3) Graphics
Many say better graphic than Diablo 2.  First, it's sad to compare graphics with a game that's older then 10 years... Do you really want to compare graphics between SNES and PS3? really? Let's face it.. graphic is just ok~ nothing great.

4) Music

To begin with I found the story to be a bit muddled.  On one hand it seems to be a retelling of the Dracula story in that it involves Harker, Mina, Van Helsing and others.  On the other hand it seems to be occurring after the original story because a lot of characters already know about Dracula, except for Mina (?).  On top of that, there are references to the Lovecraft mythos (which has nothing to do with Dracula) and a very fanboyish text in an ""old"" document that starts off ""I waste him with my crossbow"".  Okaaay... that's a mood breaker.

On the plus side the graphics are very nice, the music is OK, and the 3D models are not too bad.  The voice acting is fair, though Van Helsing should have a Dutch accent.  My favorite character is Mustapha, who has many amusing things to say.

On the minus side are the seriously annoying pixel hunting, the puzzles, and the poor English.

I generally try to play adventure games without resorting to hints, but early on in this game I completely missed an item I needed because it was only a couple of pixels wide and blended into the background.  Fortunately in this game you can use the space bar to highlight the hotspots on the screen, so I ended up using this feature a lot.

Many of the puzzles seem to exist merely to have puzzles in the game since they don't make any sense in context.  Several of them are used as ""locks"" to doors, etc. ( I'm sure someone's going to go through 20 minutes of a sliding puzzle to get in their house.)  A lot of the puzzles have no instructions or hints from any other part of the game so half the ""fun"" is figuring out what to do.  This usually involves clicking all over the screen to see what can be manipulated.  (You can't use the space bar to find hot spots on close up puzzle screens, so you must resort to pixel hunting.)  I ended up using a walkthrough because I found so many of these obtuse puzzles to be frustrating.  Also, the walkthrough was necessary for one puzzle that involved reading a word problem written in stone.  The contrast was so bad I was unable to read it on the screen.

Regarding the English, there were misspellings, bad grammar, subtitles that didn't exactly match what was being said, and misused words that sometimes made it difficult to understand what was meant (or just made it laughable).

Where are the endurance races?  Or at least races that last more than 3 laps?  Ok, there are some 10 minute races... yada, yada.

Once I started the game however I was sorely disappointed to find out the game only allows your character to move around via the ""Stylus"" and the d-pad works like the button pad.  I am all for implementing the use of the Stylus in DS games, but it should be an option...not a requirement.

Everything in this game just seems to take forever.  Moving with the stylus and only being to activate your tools with the buttons is just a pain. The character tires out quickly and is constantly having to forage for food.  The whole thing is just awkward to me and I lose interest in the game very quickly.  I played Zelda's Phantom Hourglass with the Stylus method of moving around, but in that game it just worked better.

IMO the biggest challenge about this game is using the controls while the game itself isn't very challenging.  A lot of features seem stripped out of the game and it's just kinda boring.  It doesn't even measure up to HM DS Cute.  I am sure some people will enjoy this game and possibly will not be bothered by the Stylus interface, but Natsume missed the mark for me.

But the main solo play game is a lot like Half-Life; even some of the sound effects are the same!  It's the same old follow-the-path structure and apart from a few unsuspected scares (don't have a weak heart when playing this one), has no replay value except for multiplayer - which I'd recommend, MINIMUM, a 1.5/1.0 DSL connection.  Doom3 hogs internet bandwidth even more than UT2k4, et al.

Id could take a lesson from Atari about how to better use bandwidth.  UT2k4 is exceptional by comparison and is surprisingly playable on 256k down/up speeds.

Overall, it's a good game, but don't pay more than $18 for the original and $15 for the Ressurection add-on pak (so wait a few months).  Anything more is exploitation of an uncreative product that should be faster with online play.

2.0,False,"03 4, 2009",A1H89KJ9KF1SB9,B000WCN7G0,Kody Boye,"I've been a fan of the Kingdom Under Fire series since I played The Crusaders when it came out. As a fan of strategy games, I loved the fact that you had so many different units, weapons and armor to choose from, and I loved the fact that you could play as so many different characters in Heroes.

I downloaded the Circle of Doom demo off the XBox 360 marketplace, mostly because I was SOMEHOW hoping that, despite all the bad publicity and reviews the game has gotten, it would be a good game.

Boy, was I wrong.

To start, what happened to the strategy elements? That was the main point of the first two games, so why take it out of this second one?

Secondly, when did the game reduce itself to pure hack-and-slash-styled gameplay? I compare it to Dynasty Warriors for that reason (though I WILL say that Koei's Dynasty Warriors franchise is LEAGUES ahead of this game.)

To give you a rundown on the gameplay, it's like this: You start out by playing as one of the main characters, then engage in a tutorial mode after a cutscene (which I skipped, because I could barely hear the characters talking, as well as the fact that the voice acting sounded horribly lazy.) This tutorial mode teaches you how to fight (not very well at that.) You use the A and X buttons to wield your weapon(s), as well as the B and Right Button (don't confuse the button with the trigger) to use your magic. The first thing I noticed was how slow the response times were. Another thing I noticed was that, when holding the right button (as it tells you to do to use one of your special abilities,) it didn't always respond. You end up clicking or holding the button.

Another thing: The combat. When I engaged in battle with a few simple enemies, I found a fourth of my health knocked down based on the pure fact that I couldn't attack them fast enough (The Crusaders and Heroes' respond times were MUCH better and faster.) I don't recall there ever being a block button (which was in the previous two games.)

Added to this slow combat, movement is also slow. I can understand that the characters are carrying a good amount of weaponry and armor, but that gives them no excuse to move like snails. (The only excuse for that would be if they were carrying a hammer or some other weapon, which my character--Leinheart--wasn't.)

Finally, the map has you following a set path. In The Crusaders and Heroes, the map was free roam--meaning you could go ANYWHERE you wanted. In this game, you are stuck to a set path, which makes moving frustrating (and even more tedious.)

They're trying to pass the game off as an RPG, but the only RPG elements I see is the story (which doesn't seem all that good, considering you can't even enjoy the voice acting) and the weapon/armor customization (which there is hardly any.)

I didn't try the co-op mode, but I didn't plan on playing more of this horrible game. I wouldn't be surprised if people didn't buy the fourth installment based on the fact that this one was so bad.

The only reason I gave the game two stars was because... well, I played it for ten minutes, and enjoyed that small amount of time I played it (though I had no intention to play it further.)

One final note: I see that CoD was made by Blue Side and The Crusaders and Heroes were made by Phantagram, which is an obvious indicator as to why the gameplay (and everything, for that matter) is so different. I CANNOT, however, fathom why Phantagram would entrust a different company with their series. Seeing how CoD turned out, I hope they reconsider giving another company a right to make another game in one of their series.

If you plan on playing the Kingdom Under Fire series, skip CoD and play The Crusaders and Heroes (in that order)--you won't be disappointed in either of the two.",Feels like a dumbed-down version of Dynasty Warriors,1236124800,4,,

2.0,True,"10 22, 2009",A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B000FQBPCQ,The Cool Guy,"Okay so I bought a Wii, and Zelda was the must-have launch title, right? Wrong! To those who are crazy in love with this game, they are welcome to it. To all others, I say ""Don't Believe the Hype.""

First, there's the Wii control scheme. In the product description, it says:

""This new control scheme allows for much faster and more accurate control than on previous Nintendo hardware. For example, waving the remote in the air will result in Link performing the same move with the sword. To fire off on arrow, players ""pull back"" on a virtual controller string as the Wii remote's speaker lets players know that the projectile is ready for release.""

Okay, waving the sword does NOT make Link do the same move. That's not even possible without the Wii Motion Plus. And ""pulling back"" an arrow? Since when? I never had to pull back on anything.

This is obviously a Gamecube port. The Wii controls are tacked on. That's okay though, because I love the Gamecube! But forget the controls. What about the actual gameplay?

This game is very linear. And it holds your hand for far too long. I found that 10 hours into the game, I was still being tutored - for no reason. You'll feel like one of the goats you get to herd in the game. Oh yes, the goat herding... You are Link, the awesome chosen hero. Who fights evil by herding goats.

And that brings me to something else that drives me nuts about these newer Zelda games. Why is it that you have to spend HOURS doing stupid menial tasks at the beginning of the game? It's a definite turnoff to any new player. I persevered, hoping it would get better. But after chasing monkeys and running from bees and finding a lost cat and reading dumb cut scenes involving a bunch of whiny kids, I kept thinking, ""For God's sake, just give me a dang sword and let me get on with it already!"" It's like Nintendo punishes you for wanting to fight by making you do a bunch of stupid stuff beforehand.

PLEASE Nintendo, learn something here. Give people a sword AT THE BEGINNING. Throw them in the action, and let them figure it out as they go. I mean let's face it, the story always boils down to collect all pieces of whatever in the dungeons and killing Gannon. Why make this complicated? What else is there to understand?

But it's not all bad. The graphics were wonderful. More along the lines of Ocarina of Time, and definitely an improvement over the Windwaker. But too bad Twilight Princess's realistic landscape was completely populated by ridiculous, annoying, cartoony characters.

I also liked the music, particularly during some of god scenes. Very well done.

The use of the portals was very good. Definitely an improvement over Windwaker, where you used to set your sail then leave the room for an hour while you waited to finally get there. I was thankful for that!

And I've got to say, the wolf concept was awesome. Playing as the wolf is one of the coolest things you get to do in the game. I really enjoyed that part. It's too bad it is tainted somewhat by that stupid midget riding on your back.

Which brings me to one of the worst things in the game: Midna. Never has a sidekick ever been so annoying. Do you like to be mocked and told what to do all the time? And her pseudo-Japanese baby-talk voice was awful. That got really obnoxious after a while. Why does Link need a sidekick, anyway? Can't he just figure stuff out on his own like in the original NES Legend of Zelda?

The dungeons were fun. Well designed, but a little too linear. You don't really have any choice in how you beat them. There's pretty much one path to take and once you've figured it out, that's it.

The gameplay was a major step back. Or a step down, if you will. The enemies were the worst. They were complete pushovers! In other games like Windwaker or Metroid: Prime, you get a sense of dread when a giant enemy fills the whole room and towers over you. Not in this game! Here, you can just laugh at them because you already know that you are going to beat them without dying once. I couldn't believe how easy it was. At first I thought it was annoying that it took 5 pieces of heart to make a heart container instead of 4. Seemed like a lot of work. But in retrospect, why bother anyway? You'll never need more than about 6 hearts to beat the toughest boss.

Last night I finally realized that I've had it with this game. I had spent over an hour - AN HOUR! - literally searching for an ant. At that point I realized that I did not want to waste any more time on stupid side-quests and mini-games. I'm already over 40 hours into the game, and I'm wondering if it is ever going to end. I think I've got 3 dungeons left to go. But right now I'm not so sure that I can summon the will to continue. This game has a way of sucking the life out of you. But I am a POWER PLAYER, so I shall endure!

I've owned every kind of wheel and many headsets, from Turtle Beach to Logitech to Sony. Started years ago with one of the first Turtle Beach wired headsets, liked it but got tired of the wires strung across the living room and catching on my elbow when I raced. So I bought my first wireless headset, a Logitech. It had charging issues so I thought that since you get what you pay for, I'd invest in a top of the line Logitech so I bought a F540 which at the time was $150 and top of their line. It lasted about 14 months before it too failed to take a charge. So I bought the most expensive Sony Pulse (the one with the built in mic- no extending arm) for about $150. It functioned well, but was not ergonomically friendly (adjusters and sliders were so micro you couldn't feel them nor distinguish them) and extremely uncomfortable for me so I sold them to a friend for $50. I then invested in the new Thrustmaster wireless (currently have a Thrustmaster T500RS wheel) which set me back $143. They worked well and were comfortable but within 2 weeks, the ON/OFF switch failed and you couldn't turn the headphones off. If you couldn't turn them off, then you also couldn't turn them on, which was what you needed to do to initiate the pairing function with the transmitter.

Which led me to this specific set of wireless Sony headphones. They are the cheaper little brother of the Pulse and I had several friends who had them and liked them, so I bought a set. However, within 2 weeks, they too started having charging issues and also would drop audio intermittently ... thought it was a result of having a weak battery. If I charged the headset for 6 hours or until the red charge light went out, they would deliver about 15 minutes of use before the purple light would display and they would drop audio. Thankfully Amazon cares about its customers and allowed me to return them.

When one is confronted by a game that consistently scores 5/5 on most review sites one would expect the game to be revolutionary.
Halo is, however, anything but. The enemies are stupid (i don't mean that their AI is lacking, but rather, that they are programmed to be invalids and cowards) and excessively numerous. There were many times where I found myself in a gun turret, with my hand off the keyboard, holding down the fire button and leisurely offing fifty or sixty enemies.
After you've gunned down about a thousand incompetent fools who yell ""run away, he'll kill us all!"" things start to get a little boring.
Halo lacks interesting level design, an interesting story, interesting weapons, or even interesting gameplay. The things that would be ""revolutionary"" about Halo would be the use of vehicles during combat, and the occasional squad-based skirmish. However, Battlefield 1942 has both of these factors, and in greater amount. There were about five different vehicles in Halo, and there are forty plus vehicles in BF1942.
The worst part about Halo was the massive onslaught of weak enemies. Instead of battling a few, well trained enemies that would offer some kind of challenge, you fight against seemingly endless waves of pitiful enemies.
Perhaps the only thing I found of value in the game was the tactical use of grenades, and the ability to only carry two weapons. The latter would have been much more limiting and interesting if there were more than seven or eight weapons to begin with.
Bottom Line: Halo leaves much to be desired. If you're looking for a first-person shooter with a variety of vehicles, look to Battlefield 1942. If you want squad-based or tactical/realistic action, Counter-strike will leave neither you nor your wallet hungry. And if you want an action packed blow-em-away multiplayer game, they you should look no further than the Unreal Tournament series.

Fallout Las Vegas is buggy as hell and crashes a lot. I lowered all my settings and played in windowed mode. That has helped some, but the crashes are still there.

There are two major bugs to be very aware of:
If the game crashes during play do not be surprised if you lose your quick and auto save settings to a default save setting. As if you never played at all. So do a position save (you have a 1000 save spots to choose from).  Do not count on quick saves (via f5) or autosave (when you enter/exit an area, etc).

My first round I had a 21 kill streak and two level-ups when the game froze. Those stats were lost forever.

You can no longer join a match with your friends already in a squad. You have to navigate through the menus instead and hope you can join the same server (again, good luck, they almost never work. You'll get ""No Commander Slots Available,"" ""Server Full,"" ""Need an update,"" etc. even though the server details say otherwise). The gameplay is very nice, though still fairly buggy, just as BF3 was at release. But at least that game could run through many rounds without freezing and shutting down. I don't have a hard time getting kills in multiplayer, but there are times when the game seems to display other players in different locations than they really are. Result: killed from around a corner, killed with one shot, missed headshots with sniper rounds, knifing at air, etc..

DICE and EA are taking a major hit for the terrible quality and instability of this game. It was clearly pushed out months ahead of schedule in order to make the holiday lineup and compete with COD: Ghosts. I'm not a big fan of COD, but at least it's pretty stable. If you buy this game, good luck telling DICE or EA how unhappy you are with it. They already did a double XP week (a total joke consider how hard it is to finish a match and keep your score), so you only have a few months of waiting before they'll actually fix this game. Wait for it, then buy it. I'm sure in six months this will be a great game. As of right now, I'm pretty pissed at EA and DICE for selling me a broken product, all smiley-faced and telling me ""Oh yeah, oh yeah, we know, we're working on it, here's some double XP and a pistol scope to hold you over while we work on the patches."" Every system has received a patch (though according to the forums, they're not very helpful) EXCEPT XBOX1 as of 12/8, despite DICE announcing one for the week of 12/2.

A proper description is boring and tedious.  There is nothing realistic about a bunch of red blips on your HUD indicating where all the enemies are.

The vehicle controls, views and handling are also a complete joke.

I think what they attempted to do was make a realistic sim battlefield game rather than a more over the top arcade version, and arcady it certainly is not.  Where they failed is that the game seems rather unplayable, and even though it is nothing like COD or GRAW, it still is not realistic.....just slow and boring.  The tactical commands are also worth mentioning because it almost worked.  You can issue such a wide array of commands which is really cool, however holding RB and pointing with the D-pad through several sub-menus is too time consuming.  I love that they stretched the tactical possibilities, but this is a game that needed either voice command or hot button assignments or something...it just feels like too much work to issue some of the commands.

2.0,True,"04 26, 2010",A1TQN8PND2YEH3,B000SQ5LQ4,Dahne,"I loved the Splinter Cell series--until now. Ubisoft has been one of the better developers in my opinion, but recently they have been going in a direction that I don't like. Instead of making games that are challenging, creative, and fun--they are predictable, boring, and without any imagination.

So what did I like about this game? Well, first of all, I only made it through the first 3 hours of this game before I couldn't take any more, so I can only speak for the portion of it that I actually played. The story starts off slow, but the intro was interesting. I did like the way Sam is given the next target by displaying it in the scene itself. It makes the gameplay smoother. I also like the 'mark and execute'. There was more shooter than stealth in the sections that I played, but I didn't get through enough of the game to decide if that was a plus or a minus. Beyond that, there wasn't much to like. As far as the graphics go, they are decent, but nothing special.

The dialogue is offensive and lacking any imagination whatsoever. Just imagine a lot of 'f...face', 'f...you', m...... f.....', and you pretty much know the entire dialogue of every NPC.  Not much better was Sam's banal dialogue with Grim in what should have been an emotional scene. I also did not like Fisher becoming basically a thug. Sure, he feels the need for revenge, but couldn't they have thought up something a bit less predictable than just smashing everybody's face in? Perhaps they did and it came later in the game, if so, it came too late for me. As for the multi-player, I didn't play that so I can't give an opinion on it.

I see a trend in games that I personally don't care for. They are being dumbed down with over-the-top offensive language, more violence and gore, nudity, sex, and a combination of all of these, and being labeled 'M' for mature. What is the point? I see this as more juvenile than adult. Max Payne was mature and had mature themes, but it didn't use cheap tactics to achieve that. This trend is not just growing in the gaming world, but in movies and on TV. Seriously, I am getting a severe case of violence fatigue. I can't stand anymore. Fortunately, I don't watch TV, but giving up gaming is hard. Sadly, there are fewer games now where the developers actually spend the time and energy to make a creative game worth playing. There are some exceptions, like the makers of games like Portal, or Lucas Arts.

NOTE TO UBISOFT: Yes, I am in the minority. But I am one of those fortunate adults who have the financial resources to buy all the games I want and a butt-kicking gaming rig (or an Xbox) to play them on. And I actually PAY for all my games, unlike those little teens that this kind of game appeals to, who are busy downloading their pirated copies so they can play it. (I have nothing against teens by the way, I use to be one.) I just want some decent games to play where I don't have to make sure my windows are closed in case my neighbor's little girls are out playing on their driveway-like they were when I started playing this game. I forgot my windows were open at first, and only later freaked out when I remembered and ran to shut them.

In conclusion, if you want an intelligent, interesting story to go with some challenging action--look elsewhere or rent it first to see if you are going to like it. If story is not important, and you like oodles of mindless face-smashing violence, relentless profanity, repeated shooting of everyone in every segment of the game--then this is for you.

The Ear Force DSS is actually a pretty solid piece of equipment. It is NOT a USB sound card. If you connect this to your PC it will never recognize it as a USB device at all. The DSS simply gets it's power through USB and also offers an additional USB pass-through port on it so you can connect other devices as if it's just a USB extension cord. The DSS takes audio input from your PC's surround sound optical output and translates that into virtual stereo surround sound, and the effect is pretty convincing. It gives your audio that 5.1 big home theater sound with realistic room reverb making it seem like there's a wide space between you and the surrounding speakers. The DSS surround sound works with ANY headphones, no need to use the headset provided. The DSS will allow you to play audio out from it's headphone jack as well as your speaker system simultaneously meaning you can quickly switch between headphones and speaker listening without unplugging anything or changing any settings. The DSS seems to add a heavy layer of bass to your audio, and without tweaking a few soundcard settings the DSS will overdrive/distort/clip any audio you play through it. Once you solve this by greatly lowering optical output levels it works great though.

The DSS is great, however, the PX21 headset that's provided is not my first choice to use along side it. The PX21 does NOT work at all without USB power provided to it, so you can't use it on an MP3 player or other audio source that doesn't have a powered USB port. The PX21 has a persistent hissing white noise that doesn't go away no matter what volume you use or what audio/usb ports you use, it's always interlaced into whatever you're listening to. If you can tolerate the white noise the audio quality is actually pretty decent, no real complaints there. Comfort wise, the ear cups are soft and breathable, but they have a kind of burlap mesh cloth on their surface that can feel a bit rough on my sensitive ears. The ear cups do not go over my ears, they rest ontop of them all around causing pressure and discomfort after 30 minutes of use. The cord is ridiculously long and heavy. if you don't clip the inline controller to your shirt you'll feel that heavy cord tugging on your left ear. I haven't tested the mic, but I assume it's fairly basic and average in performance.

Overall, DSS is a nice piece of equipment for a good virtual surround sound experience that is pretty versatile in how many ways you can use it. The PX21 headset is the weakest part of this package.","DSS breakout box is great, PX21 headset provided is not.",1428796800,,,

2.0,False,"11 4, 2010",A3JUMMIGJ7B38X,B0030F1DOO,GarionOrb,"Ah, The Force Unleashed II.  The fact that this game was made at all is an oddity.  While the first Force Unleashed was the fastest-selling Star Wars game of all time, it didn't particularly review well, and a staggering number of gamers quickly voiced their frustrations with the game's broken controls, cheesy force graphics and its detrimentally short length.  Still, that game did boast a phenomenal (and canonical) story that fit in perfectly with George Lucas' Star Wars lore.  The game shows the birth of the Rebellion against the Empire at the hands of Darth Vader's secret apprentice, codenamed Starkiller.  Beware of spoilers ahead, if you haven't finished the first game.  There were two outcomes possible...you could kill Vader and end up a mindless slave of the Emperor, or Vader would kill you, effectively making you a martyr and giving strength to the Rebellion.  The Force Unleashed II begins under the assumption that you chose the latter path.  That is its first problem...

With that ending in mind, the story of The Force Unleashed ended...for good.  Lucasarts, however, were put on the spot to create a sequel, and to do that they had to deal with the pesky problem of continuity.  The result is a bland, contrived story that comes nowhere near the splendor of the first game.  Starkiller has been cloned, though it's never quite revealed if he is in face one of the clones.  Once he escapes imprisonment by Vader, the game begins as Starkiller's #1 priority is to find Juno Eclipse, his love interest and former pilot from the first game.  This motivation is played up too often, but comes off as whiny and selfish.  Moreover, the plot never moves on from that, making it fall flat on its face as it basically goes nowhere.  The end of the game features a similar ""light side"" or ""dark side"" ending, so we'll see how that ends up in the hinted-at sequel.  Ah well, the gameplay...

Right off, The Force Unleashed II makes a fantastic first impression!  You're thrust into a thrilling fight to escape the planet of Kamino, with some impressive combat and a couple of awe-inspiring sequences where you're falling down to a platform far below...rain and obstacles coming at you while you use the force to dispose of them.  The combat in this game is ultra-tight and a vast improvement from the first game.  Starkiller is POWERFUL here...almost too powerful.  At your disposal you have twin light sabers (which can also dismember your opponents), the force lightning and the force push.  Soon after, you're given the force repulse, Jedi mind trick and light saber throw ability.  The result is an astonishing array of options for you to wreak havoc at your foes.  New kinds of enemies are introduced at regular intervals in this first level, and you have to figure out how to best defeat them.  Some are immune to force powers, others block all physical attacks.  By the time you finish this first level, it's not hard to feel exhilarated by the action in this game.  Then you hit the second level and do it all again...and again in the third...etc.  You'll fight wave after wave of enemies, but they're all the exact same enemies you fought in the first level.  It never introduces anything new.  After a short while, the game quickly becomes a chore until quite suddenly...it ends.  Yes, this game is short.  So short in fact, it's downright insulting.  You will not get sixty dollars' worth of content here.  On normal, you're looking at 4-5 hours...3 on easy.  There is basically no reason to pay full price for this game...at all.  I would highly recommend giving it a rental instead.

The game's graphics are light years ahead of its predecessor.  I was frequently very impressed with the level of detail and how well the game runs.  You will occasionally run into some minor glitches and see enemies or obstacles floating in mid-air, but it doesn't happen too often.  The pre-rendered cutscenes are immaculate.  Unfortunately the same level of detail wasn't given to level design.  Each level really only has 2 or 3 different ""rooms"", which are repeated ad nauseum until you reach the boss.  Oh yeah...there's only 3 bosses in this game, and only one (the end of level 2) that's really great.  Also, speaking of levels, there's only about 6 of them and most get really boring.  This is because the majority of the game is spent on Kamino (which is grey and rainy) or an orbiting spaceship (which is grey and dark).  There's also a very very brief level on Dagobah (which is grey and jungle-y)...you see where I'm going with this.  Yes, the graphics are beautiful, but the locales chosen for the game are so bland!  Why not follow the example of the first game and give us some variety?  The game's second level is gorgeous...why couldn't we get more of that?

So yes, this is The Force Unleashed II.  It's a fun game at times, but the horrendously short length keeps me from recommending that anyone fork over full price for this game.  It's a shame because the game has so much potential!  But in the end, it comes off as a rushed product.  Whereas the first Force Unleashed had a great story to make up for the poor gameplay, the exact opposite is true of the second game.  Unfortunately, there are many more games in this genre that feature great gameplay AND good stories (see Dante's Inferno, God of War III, Enslaved), so you decide if a sub-par Star Wars tale is worth it to you.",A very polished disappointment...,1288828800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The downside to this is there is massive slowdown during large firefights which can really bite.

The game has you playing Cpt. Pierce who is an Army Marine trying to fight off an invasion of infected government experiments. Through the game you have only four maybe five weapons, a couple vehicle segments (think Gears of War), and a couple of helicopter/turret segments...that's it. While the game isn't boring thanks to it's six hour length, the content is paper thin. The story is rushed and it feels like the developers just rushed this game out way too early.

The online multiplayer isn't very fun thanks to the few weapons you have. There are also only maybe six different enemy types through the whole game as well.

The graphics, music and realistic movements of the babies are very well done all very colorful and eye catching, great music too. Though the sounds and graphics are wonderful the game gets repetitive too quickly and you have a hard time using the stylus to perform every single task in the game, which often evades you to the extreme in many chores.

I started the game on ""Novice"" level to see if I could pick up the controls and game play quickly. The controls are very easy to handle, with the ""A"" button used for firing (and dropping bombs), the directional pad for moving your guns (and airplane), and the shoulder buttons for cycling through the nine machine gun positions on the B-17.

Each mission starts with a briefing where you are shown your main target with a history of the objective. Then you are brought to a page which lists your secondary targets as well. You watch your plane take off and are then immediately placed into a gunners position ready to fight off the ""Jerries"" (slang for Germans). In this first stage you fight off waves of German planes utilizing your nine gunner positions. All you do here is switch between the positions to get airplanes coming at your from various positions. Once you fight off the initial wave you are then put in charge of the plane to dodge flak. Really here all you are doing is moving the plane left to right to avoid the flak clouds. There is no changing altitude, no changing speed, no firing guns, no dropping bombs. Just moving left to right. Then you fight another wave of fighters. Once this ""third stage"" is complete, you are put in the Bombardier position with a bomb reticule where you search for your targets (bridges, factories, AA gun positions, boats, airfields) and drop bombs on them. Here you're either pressing ""A"" to release an endless supply of bombs, or changing your altitude and moving left to right to line up your shot. Once this stage is done, you go back to fighting back one last wave of fighters on the return home.

This pattern repeats itself for twenty five missions. It wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that while the missions are ""different"" they're not. There are several stages where you have to bomb bridges, and while the bridges are given different names, the map is the same. Same goes for the airfields, and the factories, and the submarine hangars. This game is essentially the same five or six stages repeated over four to five times.

To start with, the graphics are pretty poor.  Yeah, I know its a Wii but they look like something you would have seen on Nintendo 64.

The various modes of gameplay are varied enough that you can spend a good while in each of them but in reality, its all the same.

The regular ""play ball"" is okay, about what you'd expect...just a single game.
The season play is about the same.
The legend mode is kind of fun but the mini games are rather pointless in that you have to ""pass"" them in order to move on...so its more frustrating than fun.  The way the games are set up make them tedious.

The actual gameplay is okay...being able to actually throw a pitch or swing the bat is nice but once you get past that, its just kind of a dull repetative game.  There are some times in the game where you'll have a ""duel"" between a hitter and a pitcher and all the hitter has to do is make contact and he'll hit a homerun...kind of silly to me.
Another aspect are the ""legendary plays"" when someone makes a great catch.  They usually occur about every other inning so they loose their ""coolness"" pretty quickly.
Pitching is easy...just get your powerbar to max and the hitter is going to strike out.  Move your controller with some twist and there you have it.

The rosters for the teams are pretty limited.  You have probably a total of 5-6 pitchers...which I guess doesn't really matter because all pitchers pretty much pitch the same.

In all, this game is fun to just play a pickup game but it doesn't have everything that it could or should.  They could have done much much better on this.",A bit underwhelming,1249344000,5,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},
2.0,False,"09 10, 2014",AC4TQ8K03VU7C,B00J128FO6,Christopher Whitten,"This is a pretty lame product, especially for something that appears to be well-designed.

Initially, I was impressed by its design, mainly because it fits the PS4 seamlessly via clamps on either side that slide right onto the unit, and connects to its power port. It even has a nice slant to fit the parallelogram profile of the system. On the right side, there is a big fan for its larger section, and then 2 small fans on the thin side that sits under the system's other ports.

The Intercooler connects to the system's power port, and thus receives power from the same cord, and passes through power to the system. This is a nice setup as the fans will thus turn on/off with your system activity.

Normally, all of this would seem awesome, except the accessory is clearly cheaply made.

Fans should either have a temperature sensor to detect when to increase or decrease RPM based on the system's heat output, or have a max RPM that is reasonable for its common use. However, when you initially turn this on, the fans spin-up to an obnoxiously high level, and then settle at a point that isn't far below that starting max. While it runs, the fans are constantly very, very loud, making this especially annoying if all you end up doing is watching a show. Honestly, I have built PCs, and in my experience, no healthy fan should be making sounds like that. Keep in mind, because it turns on/off with the system, it's no longer a simple choice of when to use it.

In the end, the product is, to me, not worth the expense or the hassle from the noise. The PS4 normally doesn't run very warm, and as long as you keep it in a decently ventilated area, it should keep itself appropriately cool. Obviously, keeping it in a super cramped space isn't a good idea. If you feel that you maintain it in an area, or environment that is constantly warmer than you are comfortable with, purchase a small, table stand-fan to prop nearby it and blow warm air away. I feel this would be a cheaper, quieter solution for your issue.

Well with Diablo III you don't have to worry about it the game looks exactly like Diablo 2 in fact you could probably call this Diablo 2.1. Eleven years after Diablo 2 comes out and they haven't made hardly any changes that you can you tell, I'm not sure what they were thinking. Here are my observations of the game. First the biggest thing is to play single player you have to play online through Battle Net. This has to be the dumbest idea they could have come up with.  I had problems getting my account setup since I hadn't played Battle Net in about 10 years so I didn't remember my password and the other information to reset it. It took several hours to get the download and get my account straightened out. I was fortunate and didn't have any problems getting into Battle Net once I had my account setup.  I did have problems once I got on; I got kicked out of Battle Net 3 times during the game. Once after a major Boss Fight and I lost all of the treasure, which really made me mad. There is a lot of server lag where you are in a fight and one second you are toe to toe fighting it out and the next you're on the other side of the screen, so disappointing.
  The game took me about 25 hours to complete with a level 31 Barbarian. The graphics and music are pretty much the same as Diablo 2 and you still have this far away camera angle and you can't zoom in to your character. I guess it really doesn't matter since you can't really customize your character you're stuck with one of five premade character classes all with a male or female option. You would think after 11 years you would be able to customize what your character looks like hair color and style and facial hair or not, nope they made them for you and sometime they are just ugly. You would think if you play with friends you could get confused on which is your character.
  Like I said there is nothing new in the game I did notice that they removed the matched armor sets that if you got the entire set it would give you a bonus. The game just got tedious after a while and I had to force myself to complete the game. In fact the only thing I really liked was the cut scenes the animation is just mind blowing they look so good.

In-depth review (potential spoilers)
This game suffers from huge foundation problems that go far beyond the facial animations plaguing the initial release. But first I'll start with the good. The controls, the leveling system, and combat are fine.

Now for the bad.
The entire game hangs the entire premise on a group of explorers leaving the Milky Way to explore a new galaxy for no apparent reason. This would be okay except they take 10,000 members of every major species on individual colony ships. They leave at a time in Mass Effect 2 before the Reapers are known by the masses. Fans of the series would know that the strife between the races would easily prevent them from cooperating in such a massive under-taking. The Quarians, who have interest only in their home world, set out on the journey (completely out of character for their species) and got lost. They don't have a single appearance whatsoever. They may appear in the next title ... if Bioware has the stones to make another worth playing.

The game is designed to be a quasi-open world. The problem is Bioware didn't fill the worlds with anything to speak of. Landscape, random encounters from one single hostile force that isn't even native to Andromeda, machines left behind by former inhabitants (that left the system and whom you never meet), and one (yes, just one) native species to the entire frickin' galaxy (and most of them are identical with the same voice actor even though they're different). Every planet has the exact same three wild animals. On one planet there is a rogue group from the Milky Way. On another is a town where the natives live. Other than that there are no central hubs on the planets. You won't find ruins left behind by inhabitants of Andromeda. All you will find are small military outposts  For a game trying to start the series fresh in a new galaxy using an open-world design, it falls extremely short. Great concept. Poor execution.

The voice acting is atrocious. Mass Effect games are heavy with spoken dialogue in choice-driven cut-scene-like dialogue between characters. A game like this needs to have great writing and fantastic voice acting. Mass Effect Andromeda has neither. In one cheesy exchange late-game a leader of the humans actually tells you to ""give him the heel of your boot"" in the most over-the-top B-rated style tone imaginable. The writing is made worse by a forgettable cast of characters. At no time during my hundred hours of logged time did I develop a liking to any character aboard the ship. The previous titles had plenty of interesting characters that added depth to the story. Andromeda does not. By the end of the game I expected scenes to play out that may have resulted in the deaths of crew members only to realize that I didn't care if anyone died.

The game mechanics ... I'm mixed here. I pride myself on being fair and honest. But this game has me conflicted. It does some things well and handles others poorly. Movement and combat are fine. The point system for leveling is similar to previous titles. You can choose points from tech, biotics, etc. without being tied to a play-style. But after logging a hundred hours and having a large array of abilities at my disposal I was frustrated to find that I couldn't just pull up the good old power wheel and throw a power. I had to have it bound to a hot-key. If the three hotkeys were used I had to pull up the wheel and switch to another profile (basically you get four profiles, three powers per profile). But when you're using four powers constantly it becomes a serious pain to change from one profile to another and then back again.

Don't go in expecting to be able to take your favorite weapon and give one to your teammate. You define their powers when they level up. That's it. By the end of the game I had weapons that were weaker versions of weapons I was using because I crafted one, and later crafted an upgraded version. I had old armor that would have turned my teammates into nearly unstoppable biotics (because I wore them and was destroying everything in my path) but for whatever reason I could not give it to anyone.

They're going to bombard you with side quests with little story value, many of which are errand-type quests. They're also not going to allow you to mark more than one at a time on your map. Oh, and the minimap is gone. You get a Skyrim-style compass. But seriously (Bioware, if you're reading pay attention), if you're going to copy something like Skyrim's compass do it right. Not allowing players to mark more than one quest when you literally be given about a hundred over the course of the game is just stupid.

The numerous bugs and facial animations have been covered by numerous others. It bothers me but you don't need me going through all that again.

The character creation tool. Where to begin with this travesty ... The presets are all strange. I set out trying to get Ryder to look as close to my version of Shepard as possible. The are no truly Caucasian skin tones. They just aren't there. I won't even attempt to speculate why. I had the options to create an Asian with a blue afro (no, I'm not joking) but I couldn't create a Caucasion female with short naturally-red hair (their red looked like a clown's wig). They give you ten custom models and you can only tweak pieces of the presets. You do not have enough control to truly customize the face even though the capabilities are obviously there.

The following sections contain spoilers.

Choices have been a huge staple in Mass Effect titles and other Bioware games. Andromeda has choices. The problem is they don't really carry much weight. In Mass Effect 2 the level of commitment to your crew and the choices you make int he final mission dictate how many, if any, of your crew will die. In Mass Effect 3 there are situation where major characters may die during quests. In Mass Effect Andromeda it doesn't matter what you do. Your entire crew will survive. Your choices affect minor characters that don't really matter, therefore your choices really have no effect on the way the story plays out.

The game's central focus is on figuring out why planets that appeared to be inhabitable are not. To over-simplify the plot, the focal villain of the game are a species of tyrants looking to transform other species, turning them into more of the same tyrants. It gets really old really fast fighting the same handful of enemy types. The AI isn't very smart and it isn't long before you have weapons strong enough to rip through hordes of enemies like a hot knife through butter. The only way to get a challenge is to play on the most difficult setting and that's a stretch. But I digress. The plot becomes borderline irritating. Visit a planet, it isn't livable, look for underground control centers to ""fix"" a terraforming problem (this process is never really explained. You're expected to just accept that this is the goal), place an outpost, and before you leave maybe come across one quest that furthers the plot a little more. The game started off strong but by the time I ""fixed"" the third planet I wanted the game to end just so I could see if the end was better than everything since the game's opening.","Do not purchase this expecting the quality of Mass Effect 1, 2 or 3.",1492560000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

You will be pitching with two outs and will include a pop-up to an outfielder.  It will look like the inning is over and then two outfielders will collide and the runner will get an inside the park homerun.

That has happened to me perhaps a dozen times in the last week and it is just shameful that it happens at all -- not to mention so frequently.

Also there are lots of problems with the animations -- scenes that stutter and people who catch balls thrown at their backs.  The stuttering is especially shameful because no one can claim that the stuttering is due to a particular hardware configuration, as with the PC.

Also, it is nearly impossible to run the bases manually.  I've played 100+ games and still am having difficulties controlling only one runner at a time.

If you are buying this just be aware that this is not new, it's a rereleased port of a four year old PS2 fitness program. It is very good for what it is (almost an interactive DVD workout you can customize). When I wrote the review, I knew it was being billed as a sequel to Yourself! Fitness, and I was very frustrated at buying the same thing I already owned. You still have to weigh yourself in Wii Fit or on a regular scale and hand enter your info in this program. I just don't understand why Ubisoft couldn't have modified the original game to take a weigh in from the balance board, and even utilized it on appropriate excercises. My review score is simply based off the lack of effort and laziness of Ubisoft. New Scores: For an  interactive DVD workout: 4 out of 5. Ubisoft's effort on this port: 1 out of 5. Original text follows:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is was actually released a few years back under the name ""Yourself Fitness"" for PS2, PC and Xbox about four years ago. For what it is, it was an excellent fitness program. This has a couple of added excercises, so you might call it an update, but it's really almost exactly the same. (see it here [...] (Just click on the video))

If you are expecting balance board software, stay clear. This is simply a customizable fitness DVD! You can tailor your routine to what aspect you want to focus on. You can use whatever normal fitness equipment you own, hand weights, steps, balance ball, etc into the routines.

One plus is that is does change up the routines for you! Everyday will be something slightly different. Another plus is that you can view the excercise from every angle to make sure you're doing it correctly.

It does track your stats (though without the balance board you must enter them yourself), it periodically tests you, and updates your routines accordingly.

It has allows you to do full yoga routines, as well, also randomizing them.

Not sure yet, but the PS2, XBox1, PC version some recipes to help you plan your diet. They might be included here as well.

Don't get me wrong, Yourself! Fitness was excellent four years ago before the creation of an interactive balance board. This is basically the same four year old game repackaged for a quick buck (in the usual Ubisoft style). But just because this is a four year old interactive DVD, at least its not Jillian Michaels level of horrible. It's just not interactive like Wii fit. It a DVD that you can customize to create a custom workout.

It could have/should have been a much more updated version, utilizing the balance board that most people purchasing this probably already own.

This wheel has a very small turning radius of 240 degrees, so it doesn't even feel like a ""wheel"" to me. The pedals are abysmal, and do not have a smooth action when pressed. Not that you can buy an adapter from a company called Ricmotech to us Logitech pedals with Thrustmaster wheels, so if you've already got a DFGT, G25 or G27, you're better off getting the $20 adapter and using those pedals.

Movement control is clunky, especially since you have to use the the ""look"" command in specific (VERY specific) onscreen hotspots to perform anything but the most basic of actions.  Has some serious glitch issues as well (eg, I died during a boss fight, yet the cinematic showing the boss' death played and I went to the next level).  And for some reason, the only way to walk quietly is crouched down.  Hunh.

The story is silly.  Omega 19 (A fatty acid?) killed your family, and now they're going to blow up the world.  Or some other run-of-the-mill badnik stuff.  I didn't care, and you probably won't either.  The journeyman voice cast mostly gets the job done, though the lead actress is both lousy and miscast.  One of the villains died twice in the script, too.

The big beef with this puppy is the challenge.  Not the actual game-play; that's standard sneaky stuff.  Some of the solutions just don't make a lot of sense.  For example, a puzzle makes you avoid setting off a heat sensor by running into a freezer for a few seconds first, apparently lowering your body temperature.  Not only would this not work (to drop her body temp at all she'd have to just about freeze to death), it's not even explained what's happening when you're in the freezer.

Elsewhere, you have to bug a room that has a character in it.  Problem is, you don't know at this point what she looks/sounds like.  When you walk down a corridor a short audio clip of someone speaking plays once, though on some playthroughs it fails to play at all.  You then have to crawl through the ventilation system (avoiding the cliche police) and set the bug, though you can't even see the people you're listening in on when you do.  If the audio clip didn't load, you'll have no idea what it is you're even doing.

If you get stuck, and with all the nonsense in this title you will, you have to run from room to room, using that frustrating ""look"" command to find the miniscule hotspots, then guess what the game's screwed-up logic wants you to do.  And the levels are surprisingly linear for a game like this.  Some of the guards just stand there and stare at each other, too.

Although the game looks great, it plays just like every other major shooter I've experienced.

The single player campaign is short and just kind of uninspired.  You're supposed to be in charge of the unit for much of the game, but Irish is clearly the boss and you are powerless to make any decisions.

The environment is fairly static with the exception of the building that collapses in the first ""17 minutes"" of the game which was seemingly designed as a prolonged trailer for marketing purposes.

The multiplayer is a big disorganized mess and objectives offer no immediate rewards or consequences.  It's all a giant team deathmatch and with so many players in a match you are basically just one of the crowd unless you are one of the hardcore players who is fully dedicated to the game.  I know this experience is pretty much present in any online multiplayer but the map designs and player capacity of BF4 make the issue feel worse than ever.

The developers stayed true to the style and look of past silent hill games, which is great. The graphics were up to standards with the series as well. Actually, just about everything was except for the gameplay. To put it simply, the game is way too hard. All it takes is one enemy to kill you almost instantly. When the enemies attack you, you are stunned and unable to defend yourself. As your stunned, they continue to attack you until you until your health runs out and you die. So basically, once an enemy starts attacking you (mainly the nurses) there's no escape. What makes this even more frustrating are the checkpoints, or lack thereof. The checkpoints are way to far in between. You will find yourself running tasks, errands and fighting through the same enemies multiple times until you get the the next one.

Its a shame this game turned out that bad, I was really looking forward to it.

Skyward Sword is without a doubt the biggest disappointment in this tired franchise history.  If Nintendo plans for the Wii U to survive this new console generation, they need to stop rehashing their same old Zelda and Mario kiddy content over and over again.  They need to wake up and take some hints from far superior adult RPGs like The Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect and even Assassin's Creed.  Skyward Sword is the product of Nintendo's blatant laziness and lack of respect for long time Zelda fans.

OOOOOH NOOOOO!!  You Nintendo fan boys protest that most of the mainstream sheeple Demon Pig media sites all gave Skyward Sword high marks??  $$ INSERT DOLLARS HERE $$  Unfortunately, much like TV, movies, and music nowadays, critical acclaim means absolutely nothing as far as something actually being good.

Where to start with this utter trash??

Graphics are a complete joke for a game released in 2011.  They somehow managed to take the cartoon look of WW and combine it with the washed-out pastel color palate of TP to create something truly uninspired and awful.  These graphics are laughably bad.  They seriously look like 2001 at best.  The cartoon look of WW was annoying, but at least is was sharp and vivid.  The washed-out look of TP was annoying, but at least it felt somewhat grown-up.  Skyward Sword looks horrible.

Sound is as usual completely void of voice-acting.  Again, this is inexcusable for a game released in 2011.  I understand you don't need to make Link talk, but for God's sake why can't the NPCs actually communicate and act like living beings??  It completely takes you out of the experience and makes you feel like you're playing a kiddy game.  The musical score is overall decent, but nothing nearly as memorable as OOT or WW.  The harp is utterly stupid and pointless, and the very few times you actually need to strum it properly are an exercise in frustration.

The Wii motion+ controls are implemented OK for most of the game, in fact I often quite enjoyed slashing away at different enemies in the precise direction needed.  However, the motion control limitations rear their ugly head at the worst opportune times, which are the boss battles.  Need to switch between your sword and secondary weapon quickly?  Good luck trying to select and recenter your secondary weapon on the fly!

Roughly 75% of the gameplay is nothing more than a boring chore to open the next map area, obtain the next item, complete the next fetch quest, gather stupid treasures to upgrade items, or gather stupid bugs to upgrade potions.  There is no real overworld to speak of, only Skyloft, a forest area, a volcano area, and a desert area.  You keep revisiting these same areas over and over and over again to simply open up another small portion or twist within.  Completely linear gameplay with virtually ZERO exploration whatsoever.  Just think of the beautiful overworld of Oblivion or Skyrim and then laugh at this utter garbage!

Anything that is actually a treasure such as a Goddess Cube reward like a piece of heart is immediately shown on your map, as are almost every single solitary objective in the game.  If it's not revealed on your map, fear not, because your constant annoying sidekick Fi will make sure she reminds you exactly what to do and where you are supposed to go.  Well, there will be at least an 85% chance!  This kiddy game is apparently geared towards 7 year olds, because that is how it treats you the entire way.  Puzzles are a joke, and dungeon design although innovative in the tradition of Zelda, is severely hindered by all the hand-holding G-rated nonsense.

On the other hand, Nintendo inexplicably decided to make a couple of the half dozen or so mini-games so insanely difficult to beat that you will need to spend many hours of frustration getting those last few pieces of heart (unless you get very lucky).  In particular, the Boss Rush lightning round requires you to repeat not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7, but 8 of the bosses you have already defeated consecutively, and without being able to use heart potions or bottled fairies.  Even when using the Guardian Potion+ trick this mini-game is nearly impossible unless you get VERY LUCKY with the specific order that the Thunder Dragon decides the boss battles for you (in other words, the 2 or 3 battles that actually give you hearts).  You will NOT be able to get Link's classic Hylian Shield unless you submit to this redundant root canal exercise, leaving the game feeling empty and incomplete.

And speaking of boss battles, Skyward Sword falls well short of Zelda standards in this respect as well.  Of the 16 or so boss battles in the game, almost half of them are literally REPEATS of the same freaking boss!  Thanks Nintendo, I so wanted to fight a giant black worm not once, not twice, but thrice, and then more times in the mini-game!  Thanks again Nintendo, I so wanted to fight the homosexual ninja not once, not twice, but thrice, and then more times in the mini-game!

The story is somewhat different and compelling, but everything else in the game is so dull, repetitive and lifeless that I found myself barely even caring about Zelda or the fate of the world for that matter.  I am currently at the last dungeon in the game, but can barely muster the energy to finish Skyward Sword simply because is has not been a fun experience.  My only hope is that this game somehow musters an epic final boss battle the likes of TP, which truly saved that flawed game in the end.  From what I have read online that wish will most likely not come true.

It's so f-ing boring, damn it! The locations are lifeless. The music is so generic, it belongs in Need for Speed 2. The whole game feels like an old racer, way before Midnight Club.

There are a lot of network features, that make a difference, but don't really add much depth. Sometimes the servers are down for no reason whatsoever. Multiplayer rarely works good, although I haven't had any connection problems with NFS Rivals or The Crew.

I dropped this game after beating a few tours. Why? It's simple. Whatever car you drive, it feels similar to the other one. If you drive a hatchback, it goes fast. If you drive a GT, it feels the same as a hatchback, but a little bit faster. A hyper car is simply uncontrollable. I've had a few cars from the list so I know, how they should feel.

While the story was much better than I had expected, it left a lot out and sometimes just made no sense (The lab... did the humans create the Locust?  I couldn't tell).

The game play was ok, there was enough variety in weapons to be fun without being confusing (Though I played most of the game with only the chainsaw gun and sniper rifle, occasionally a grenade but never a pistol unless I ran out of ammo for everything else) but the game just felt lacking.  I know, vague, but much of the game played the same way; get under cover, fire until everything is dead, find next cover, repeat.  The few times when you were given a chance to ride in/on something ended quickly and at times mind numbingly frustrating.  The ending was a little blah, circle the super-monster-bomb while it was bombarded by orbital satellites until it exploded, not that interesting considering you were riding that monster before it decided to mutate.

Multiplayer is just boring.  The game systems function great against the AI but when playing with other people it again was slow and often a situation of who had the biggest gun or brought a friend.

I really liked the Native American / alien abduction aspect of the original, but sadly, that's all done away with. The new Prey has many problems. It's basically BioShock in space, from the over-used art-deco visual motifs down to the way ""neuromods"" are injected into your body (skills/abilities).

The game map itself is very small, taking place entirely on a space station, which has about 12 sections. To get from one section to the next, you have to suffer a 1-2 minute load time. If you play this game from start to finish, you will literally waste several hours of your life on load screens. This is absolutely the worst aspect of the game, and possibly a limitation of the CryEngine. It really takes you out of the experience, and I dreaded having to go through a door. Compare this to Zero Dawn Horizon, which is free roam and open world, with no load times.

Most rooms and computer terminals are initially locked and you have to find the corresponding keycard or password in another part of the station to progress. So typical gameplay is, go to one section of the station, find the card/code then go back to the other part of the station. You will have to travel back and forth between sections many times. Some locks require hacking to open, which you can do once you've acquired the right hacking skill level. Hacking an item opens a timed maze mini-game. Get the cursor into the target and avoid the walls of the maze, which shock and slow you down. Some doors absolutely require the appropriate card to open and are not hackable.

The weapons are very limited, underpowered, and lame: shotgun, Gloo gun (shoots incapacitating foam), stun gun, pistol, wrench, etc. The game is set in 2032 which is not that far in the future, but really, some better, more original weapons would've been more fun. I ended up using the wrench most of the game because most of the weapons were useless. The pistol, for example, does a paltry 12 damage! 12!

Enemy design is also very limited. You'll see only about a dozen different kinds of aliens, which either float, scuttle, or are bipedal. There's not much variation. One aspect of the game I did enjoy was the materials recycler, but maybe that's because of my OCD. Put unwanted items in the bin and convert them to basic materials cubes, which can be fed into a Fabricator to make items/weapons/upgrades.

I finished the game, out of nothing more than pure stubbornness. I wish I hadn't. The ending is extremely unsatisfying. I won't spoil it for you, but it's really disappointing and made me feel even worse about wasting many hours on the game. It's a bit disingenuous to have spent so much time playing to find out that the ending is what it is, and that your actions have no consequence. If you rescue crew, there's no reward at the end. You are also lied to. One of the objectives in a side mission is to ""escape Talos I"". If you complete the step, the game immediately ends with a voiceover!

After the events of the intro, you start out on a remote, alien planet, with no memory. You are immediately found by Elma - a military woman who can clearly handle herself in a fight. This was great. Unfortunately, it was mostly downhill from there.

Pros:

+ It's an RPG on the Wii U, which is a rare thing

+ Large open world, with beautiful alien landscapes

+ Elma - a great character with interesting abilities.

+ Skells - these are gigantic mechs that you can pilot. They're awesome - and not enough games have mechs included.

Cons:

- The dialogue - Wow. The writing is bad, and the bad writing is poorly delivered by the voice actors. Every conversation had at least three or four cringe-worthy moments, and the writing/story was so bad anyway that I found myself longing to skip the cutscenes.

- The lack of instruction - The Wii U is a great console for being accessible. Most games on this system are fairly easy to learn how to play. They explain what is going on (occasionally too much), to the point that you never really wonder how things work. Xenoblade Chronicles X is the antithesis of that. The game barely explains anything beyond basic controls, and you are left wondering ""Why is that ability flashing?"" or ""What does that indicator mean?"" until you dedicate a couple of hours to reading the electronic manuals. To be fair, the manuals do an excellent job of explaining things, but it seems a little strange to require the player to read the electronic manual but NOT tell them to do so.

- The Combat - This is boring and uninspired. It mostly consists of watching your character fire/attack, and waiting for cues and callouts from your teammates so you can do combo attacks. At best, the combat feels like a slightly more boring version of stereotypical MMO combat (during tougher fights such as boss fights). At worst, you feel like you barely need to even pay attention to the combat (most fights in the open world). Many of the other faults of the game could've been forgiven if the combat was fun, but it was one of the worst parts of the game, and unfortunately, what you spend most of your time doing.

- The Graphics - To be fair, this game pulls off some impressive graphics, given the hardware it has to work with. With that acknowledged, the graphics look extremely dated for the most part. Things look pretty good from a distance, but when you get close you start to see how subpar the graphics are, especially if you've been playing any other modern games.

- The load times - I bought this game on disc. The load times were horrendous. By far the worst in any game I've ever played. They've tried to mitigate this by offering ""optimization packs"" as free DLC on the eShop, which basically downloads parts of the game to your hard drive so they don't have to load off the disc. While this definitely helps, it also takes up a significant amount of hard drive space. If you're using your stock 32 GB  hard drive, be prepared to dedicate a large part of your hard drive to these optimization packs. Even with the packs installed, the load times are still pretty bad. For example, I frequently had to wait 15-20 seconds for my character to re-appear on screen after changing a single piece of equipment. It took so long that the first time it happened, I literally thought something had gone wrong with the game.

- The story - It really wasn't that interesting past the intro.

- The characters - Except Elma, the characters were all pretty bland, and some of them were downright annoying. The worst offenders were some of your early party members - you have Lin, the thirteen year old girl who is supposed to be edgy but mostly comes off sounding stupid most of the time. You have Tatsu - the talking vegetable (yes, really. Your characters spend a dialogue scene trying to decide if he's a potato or a turnip), who annoyed me every time he talked. The later companions you get are a little better, but everyone is bland, poorly acted, and underdeveloped.

Overall, this game was a major disappointment for me. Obviously there are people who enjoy it (the game currently has a 4.5 star overall rating, for example) but it is definitely not for everyone. There are much better games on the market today, and I can't help but wonder if this game's high ratings come soley because of how game-starved the Wii U library is.",Mediocre at best,1463356800,5,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii U'},

I would give it a rent first see how you like it.., Its a masher so expect to hit things hundreds of times and you don't get to fight how you want to you must always do it how the game dictates no room for creativity, which is a big disappointment.

This is very much controlled like a Ps1 game. You cant look around at all. You cant look at your objective either, so you will be leaping blindly at walls waiting for a spot where it garb on and it looks silly. The game takes full advantage of the fact the controls are terrible at your expense. You will find your self walking one way only to have it go the other direction.

As nice as it looks, it can be a pain to play. You have to be so precise even to climb a simple latter that you will end up doing the same thing over and over just to have it open a chest or climb or what ever.

It takes place, I think, in the future where an alien race has assaulted planet Earth.  Apparently they have the ability to make people into their race, or something.  I don't really know, as the plot is very uninteresting and mostly inconsequential.  You play some guy, a ""Sentinel"", which means something special, but I don't know what.  As you can tell I didn't play the first one, so maybe this is all stuff I should already know.  Regardless, it all seems very generic and super thin on plot.  I have not played in multi-player, as I have no interest.  Apparently this is where the game shines, or so I'm told.  I'll never know because it is unlikely I'll ever put it back in the tray.

The environments are pretty stunning in some places, the graphics pretty good, and the sound very rich.  The gun variety is lacking...  most of the time you will have the same weapon, or whatever weapon you have ammo for.  Since you can only carry two weapons at a time you'll be forced to dump weapons in trade for whatever you can find that has ammo.  Apparently this passes as strategy.

There have definitely been a few fun parts, here and there.  Some parts where the chaos of battle is thick and you are running around, immersed.  Most of the time the game involves cheap one-hit kills or times of nothing followed by a massive wave of enemies.  Rinse, dry, repeat.  While there is variety in enemies, there isn't much variety in game play.  Yes, the game hits all the standard FPS style levels:  Open space with big combat, open space with big bad guy, enclosed space with low lights and is kind of spooky, enclosed space with lots of bad guys, one on one ""big boss"" battles, desolate towns, and alien spaceships.  All very generic.

My biggest complaint with the game is that it devolves into ""Serious Sam"" style game play.  You'll, essentially, round the corner to find a gigantic pile of bad guys who want nothing more than to kick-start your face with their massive arsenal of weaponry.  You'll do lots of running in circles trying to track and kill waves of spidery things, packs of flying drones, waves of zombie-like-rip-off things, and big dudes with player-seeking missiles.  It gets old, and in my opinion is the mark of poor level design.  Checkpoint, walk a bit, massive swam of bad guys, checkpoint.

I'm not entirely sure what I expected when I got this game, but I was certainly surprised at the poor quality of this game.  Graphics only go so far, and a good concept isn't worth anything if it is executed poorly.  Resistance 2 wouldn't be a bad rental, or even on discount -- but at full pop, it just kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.","Uncreative, repetative, waves of enemies and lame run and gun",1242345600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The good- some dirty, creepy environments and enemies.  For sheer disturbing factor, Boxman is up there with Pyramid Head IMO.  The upgrade system was well done and helps you tailor your experience the first time through.  That's about it.

The bad- oh boy...  A game that gives you precious little supplies should allow you to avoid combat.  This game rarely does.  As such, you will frequently rely on the melee button and die.  A lot.  And not in a ""I could have done better"" way, but in a ""WTF were they thinking"" way.  Your character is very weak, meaning the already limited supplies are even more precious, and frustrating, to have to use.  Forget about the story.  It's on-par with Vanquish.  But the BIGGEST travesty is in the design.  Multiple sections require near-perfect performance.  Anything less is death and retrying entire areas.

I think more then anything most people WANT this to be a great game. In my honest opinion, however, this is one of the most BORING games I have ever played. I am a fan of the 'Fallout's' , Skyrim, mass effect (all three) Borderlands 1 & 2. So I really genunenly enjoy FPS and RPG's.
The Good :
The bad: have to ALWAYS play online, so for dad's/Mom's, hubbies/Wifies, and anyone who needs to pee, you have NO PAUSE, I don't like that.
Seems to me the developers took their exsiting title (Halo) and jammed it up with loose fitting RPG elements that poorly mimic Borderlands 2.
Character customisation is a joke, because no matter which race you choose (there are only three) you back story is the same. As goes for the class system (another poorly implemented RPG element) is dosent really matter. I tried all three and had exactally the same gameplay experiance, so why have a class system to begin with?
I wanted this to be at least a good game, but its highly repetitive (Think supped-up FP World of Warcraft) enemies do not vary AT ALL. Every once in a while you come across a ""Wizard"" (In a Sci-Fi futuristic space fairing age) that is slightly more difficult then his less tanked up AI partners. Oh and the AI is horrid. They basically let you kill them, to make it more difficult there are just MORE of the same dumb enemy. Area's are okay, scenery is nothing really that special, honestly I think Oblivion had beeter sceanery for it's time.
Don't waste any money on this game, not one red cent! DO NOT PAY $60 for this, heck, after playing it for the better part of a week, I wouldent recommend this even if PS was giving it away for free.

We're supposed to believe that this is set some point in the distant future with levitating space ships, yet the weapons are still manual reload and the armor is non-existent? Sometimes I just don't get game developers. You spend a ton of time (and money) working out the 'futuristic' detail of the environments, the ships and cyborgs only to leave the troops locked back in time with 90s lame weapons and effectively no armor. Worse, there's no HUD or suits or anything that would actually say this is some kind of futuristic warfare. Because of this, it takes like 3 bullets and your character is dead.

On top of the lame game mechanics, you supposedly play as a 'team'. Yet, there's absolutely no team work at all. Nothing is more frustrating then having 3 other companions that all shoot bullets that cause no damage and kill no enemies. And, of course, this game's enemies have 100% accuracy of aim... every single one of those enemies with sights trained firmly on you, not your companions. I can excuse this game mechanic on games written in the 90s, but in this day and age it shouldn't exist. Enemies need to have far less accuracy then that so when they can't see you, they can't hurt you.

I came into this experience not expecting much, but honestly, after playing the game, I have to say that it was worse than I thought. I mean, it's not BAD, per se. It has lots of elements that you see in good games. Excellent graphics, interesting designs, varied locations, lots of things to loot, and smooth gameplay. The problem is that it all never quite comes together into a compelling experience, and for that, I absolutely blame the publisher, Activision. What the hell did they do to Bungie to downgrade them from a first class developer to a soulless cash cow? But I digress.

The story for this game is quite fascinating and deep, or at least I'm sure it is. I can't confirm that for myself, however, because I don't know what the story is. I just see tantalizing bits of it in the periphery of my vision, occasionally given to me by my robotic ""Ghost"" assistant, then it's gone. But since I'm given no reference point for why it was so significant in the first place, I have no reason to care. The game literally just pitches you face first into the middle of an epic space fantasy universe and immediately expects you to ""get it"". However, even at the beginning of the game, questions abound, and never relent. Who was I? Why did I die? Why did it take so long to bring me back to life? Am I an amnesiac? Who am I fighting? Why am I fighting them? What is the ""darkness"" and the ""light""? Are the evil factions also at war with each other? If so, why? Aren't they part of the ""darkness"" thing we're supposed to be worried about? What is the Traveler, and how is he preventing that city from being destroyed? And what the heck is up with that blue chick and her weird brother? Wait, what was I doing? Oh, God, am I an amnesiac for *real* now?!

The worst part is that you'll go into a mission with a vague idea of what you're supposed to be doing, told that it's very important for some convoluted reasons, then you'll immediately forget what your objective was and why it was important. I mean, for all I know, I'm actually the bad guy and I'm in the service of some evil deity, and we're killing aliens not for freedom but for mad loot. And then you kill an evil space blob, who is Satan, and suddenly you saved the day... apparently? I mean, we did? How? What? Huh? What's this about light ranks? Why am I doing these missions over and over again? Please buy the expansion?

Then there is the gameplay, which is, well, it's good. I mean, it's Bungie (supposedly), so the guns feel good to shoot. But still, a few things feel off. For instance, the automatic weapons are all practically worthless. They spray bullets carelessly everywhere to little effect. Okay, maybe that's just a matter of balance, but they overdid it. What matters far more in this game is not getting bullets on target, but getting *headshots*, as they are much more devastating, but they are also very difficult to achieve with a fully automatic weapon. There's also some odd choices made with the other gun types. Like, why are there three or four shot revolvers? Five is the minimum! Okay, three or four shot guns do exist (usually not as revolvers), but who would bring them into a battlefield? The stats are also hard to understand. Like, there's a category for stopping power, if I recall correctly. Okay, what does that do? And how does that relate to the damage my gun does? Finally, battles are a letdown. Every fight in Halo felt like a special event, with enemies and environments carefully chosen for the experience. Sometimes it feels that way here, but it's just as often that you'll bump into some aliens, shrug, and blast them with little effort.

Then there's magic. Yes, you have magic powers. The thing is, they all work on fairly lengthy cooldowns, so most of the killing work is done with guns. These powers are also somewhat analogous to each other, so even though they technically work differently between the classes, it doesn't seem to be sufficient to make them FEEL different. Playing as a Warlock, I can say that at no point did I feel like a space wizard. No, I was just another guy with a gun who happened to be able to throw weird grenades.

As for the missions, as mentioned before, some grand reason is always given for doing them, but it always feels like you're just a space hitman off to shoot his latest victim, with all other details being superfluous. They play out the same, too: Drop in, drive to the objective, kill guys along the way, wait for the Ghost to do something, kill more guys, then fight a boss. It's easy to see why the details fade away when you've felt like you've done it all before. You can try multiplayer, but I didn't care for it. Technically rank doesn't matter because everything is evened out, but in reality, some players will have more abilities than lower ranked players, and the fights simply lacked that smooth ebb and flow that Halo had in its multiplayer.

It's all just a damn shame because all the elements of a great game are *right there*. Something had to happen partway through development--I've heard of firings and script changes--that completely torpedoed everything, and ultimately brought us this. It would be easy to compare this to games like Borderlands, but Borderlands' plot made total sense and was a blast to play by comparison. Again, I'm forced to lay the blame for this on Activision, who, I presume, let itself get carried away with greed and just wanted Bungie as some other recognizable name to callously mine for profit, but never had any intention of allowing a true Bungie experience.","Bungie, are you feeling okay?",1445299200,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Ideally, each of you could play one of the 3 characters as you advance through the story.  Ideally, this game -- which is really quite eye-catching and fun to play -- would last you a few weeks.  Unfortunately, the latter 2 are not true and you're definitely better off splitting this game with some buddies rather than plunking down all of the cash for this yourself.  I beat the game sitting down with it one night.  It is an incredibly short game.
That's not to say it isn't fun.  I ended up playing it over and over again to buff up my characters (you really have to run through the game a few times to get each of the Bouncers pumped up to enjoy it).  Still, I couldn't help but feel cheated that a game that is as expensive as this one is should have lasted longer.  When I played Ps1 games like Jedi Power Battles, the Resident Evil series, etc., they would take me 1-3 weeks at least to finish.  Sadly, most of the ""first wave"" of Ps2 games are ""wham bam thank you sony"".
Like any of the first year games, this one is good for the combined fighting tactics you and the computer use to beat the bad guys.  It pains me that you could not get that 2nd joystick to work and have a buddy at least partner up with you.  If Jedi Power Battles can do that, why couldn't this game?  My expectations were set for a ""team up"" game -- and this game allows up to 4 people to play but only in the ""match"" mode.
As with any of the new Ps2 games, the story here less coherent than a Goddard film, but it is fun nonetheless.  Some of the combat and movie sequences are really cool (I'll nominate Dominque's ""coming out of the closet"" scene as my favorite).
Although I just got done rating ""X Squad"" with a 3, and I'd give ""Warlords"" a 4 stars, this one sadly deserves only 2.  I would buy it used or buy it with a friend so that after the adreniline high of the game is gone, and only 4-8 hours have passed, you're feel that it was worth it.
Oh, this one truly has some of the most absurd ""movie"" moments you're likely to see in a videogame.

What I've glimpsed of it in between the glitches, level resets, server kicks, and team boots is visually pretty and decently fun, like a far off land of happiness viewed through a grimy window.  Honestly, I've never seen a game this twitchy and unreliable, and I've played the Earth Defense Force games online on PS3. On the PS4, I routinely co-op with 4-16 players on highspeed Verizon Fios service and never have any connection problems -- except with Destiny.  Here, I've seen them all, as each Destiny server or network error has a helpful ""animal name"" to let you know what went wrong.  Let's say you've started a new zone with your friends.  All is well, you're blasting away, and then suddenly the screen goes black, and you respawn back at the beginning of the level all by yourself due to error code ""turtle.""  All your friends are now 10 miles away, wondering where you went and why mooks you should be fragging are now hitting them from the flank.  No worries!  You'll just start heading back up the hill towards them and -- whoops!  You're back at the beginning of the level again, this time due to error code ""monkey.""  In fact, now you can never get more than about 50 feet from the spawn point without passing out and reappearing there, something that stops being funny after the first few times.

Indeed, repeat that about 50 times, seeing different errors most of the time, and you quickly realize that Destiny is basically a militarized version of Groundhog day.  Just when you thought things were going well, the server decided you should instead relive everything you just experienced, and without the assistance of the rest of your squad.  Like Edge of Tomorrow, maybe someone killed you or you just managed to ""reset the day"" on your own.  But no matter, you at least got a funny animal name out of it.  Given that nothing even remotely like this level of instability is to be found in any other network games I play on the PS4, you have to wonder if it is intentional, something to add more challenges to what is already an interminable grind.  For me, at least, that question will forever remain unanswered, as I will never play this game again due to the frustration of losing blocks of time for no reason, and with no explanation beyond a silly animal error code.

Gameplay feels much improved over last years, I actualy have fun playing this years game, Last year just seemed off and frustrating. There are a few slowdowns in the game caused by the new presentation of the game, and the presentation will cause a break in gameplay now and then.

The Pro-tak system is new and interesting, nice to finnaly see more than 2 AI players be able to tackle, it looks more realistic.

The bad.

Franchise mode got gutted. They removed the minigames-training situations that helped level up your players, Although most of these were unplayable to me last year, maybe i am too old but the 40 yard dash, wieght lifting and the chase the running back down mini-games were impossible to me, perhaps why they were taking out to be revamped, I much preffered the older ones on XBOX version.

The Presentation is bland and repedative, It is also verry shallow, after a few games you can tell if it's a first down or not before they even messure cause there is only one animation for short or first down, they don't differe, the touchdown call is the same way. This presentation system plays out all to framilur, In NFL 2k5, they would do a shot of fans sitting in the stands, all these in madden play out almost identical, Fans getting up late in the game during a blow out wearing the loosing teams jersey's, Or a fan asleep in the stands...realy weak of EA, gotta rob from the guys they put outa buisness. The presentation also make a game longer, and becomes annoying after seeing it so many times, good thing they give you the ability to disable most of it in the settings.

The manual in no way shap or form tells u that you have to use the right analog stick when engaged on defence to break through the oline.

The Comentaters are still terrible, and say the same junk from last year, and have the same erros as well, If you pass to a WR and he breaks a tackle to get a TD, Collinsworth will talk about the play like it was a running play, Or if you change the play set where a WR stands where a TE normaly would, He would talk about that player as if he were a TE, Madden Has never been good about the overlays with comentary.

Sounds can be off, especialy if you try and speed throught the presentation, it's almost like a 5 seconds delay.

Overall I enjoy the gameplay, and enjoy playing it, but this is probably the most basic Madden game i have ever played in years.

This game is definatley over-priced since they TOOK elements from the game and didn't really ad much to it. And might i say misleading as one would expect everything from the previouse years game to be intact, this game is pretty much a rip off.

One has to question tho, with the new tackling animations and presentation, did it take up to much room on the disc that they had to cut other elements?

Alot of questions arise as to what Next Years Madden will be, as the New Madden shop is basicly another rip off, making you pay for added gameplay elements. Will they charge for the mini-games next year? will they charge for Roster updates? EA is really pushing it now.

I have enjoyed the Madden franchise, But the NFL needs to relinquish this single liecensing deal, and allow competition, a word used often in the sport of football, just not in thier video-games i guess.","Hmmm, facinating.",1254700800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

THREE whole levels! While the first two are easy the third is almost impossible to beat. The game plays light arcade light guns games of old and the Zapper works really well here.

2.0,False,"08 15, 2011",A1YK0KOUJBHGR1,B000E0OCR8,MDI,"The game is rather fun, but I have to warn you. There are parts that'll make you want to pull your hair out in frustration. That is all that you have to know about this game, is that it'll make you want to pull your hair out in frustration. If you want your sanity kept in check avoid this game at all costs.

The developers of this game show very well that they don't realize what actually counts in making a game fun, and that part is the fact that it has to be fun. Frustration only sits there to impede on this. There are numerous issues for this game and I'll explain the biggest ones below.

First and foremost, some of the 'checkpoints' wherein if you die you get ressurected to, at the end of the game are nigh and far between on the ""tanker"" level the second time you go in. You'll have a part wherein it's literally one minute time your movement perfectly or restart, then you have to jump perfectly or you'll fail and have to do that along with the one minute perfect moves again. Why they didn't make it so that you could go back to the jumping perfectly area again after you die is anyone's guess. I personally believe it's because they're idiots who don't know good QA.

The next biggest issue with thsi game is the minigames. They suck, plain and simple they suck. There is no ryhtm, there is rhyme there is no pattern. What they do is the equivalent of button mashing the controller at random intervals. This is how they do their ""minigames"". Some of them are optional, some are not. The ones that are not are the worst. The very end of the game you have one that is identical to one that you've already faced except it's a million times worse. It's pure button mashing with no pattern, at all, also no indication of progress. Also like the checkpoints in this game, minigames have none. And this is one of them, wherein if you mess up once, back to the beginning. You have to be able to handle the left/right hand of the screen top to bottom, along with being able to press all 8 of the face buttons at any given time without any messups!

Also driving any vehicle in this game is reminiscent of grand theft auto, except it's actually worse. And you have to repeatedly drive a vehicle to beat the game. So unless you like failing, time and time again, I'd avoid this game. If you are a glutten for punishment since the controls are horrible, then by all means enjoy this game.

This game has too many flaws to call it a good game. The issue here is how they designed it, and I cannot give it anything higher than 2 stars. If you take out the horrible minigames, and fix that there are badly placed checkpoints on one of the levels, and the horrible controls when piloting a vehicle then this is definately a 5 star game, the platforming is really fun, there is loads of humor and the levels are pretty well designed. But to summarize it again, avoid this game unless you're really into the jak and daxter series or are a glutten for punishemtn. I know that I'll never replay this game again, once I'm done thsi time it's going to sit on a shelf and colelct dust.

usual simple, colorful cartoon graphics. to move around the park, you either click where you want your character to go (slow moving) or you hold A & trace where you want your character to follow so you can actaully get around obstacles like other people, trash cans, trees, etc. which is needlessly annoying & frustrating. it's a half 3D/half top view so you can only so far around you & the map to look at is quite small & takes getting used to. The kids/characters are from 7 studios logo & look like unintelligent, bug-eyed, obese zombies. The music is fine, not good nor bad & the event sounds for everything are done well.
Main play:
You talk to characters, do literal ERRANDS for them, running to tell one character what another said, send them a package, go get that, etc. You also are constantly picking up weeds, planting trees or shrubs, throwing out litter, jumping into trash cans, or shaking trees to get: coins or tickets to play the mini games, clothing for your character, or collectable cards you need to pass the game. This is annoying, b/c if you pulled a weed or trash, it rematerialised, so you never know if you've been there already, to know there was nothing there anyhow. anohter thing is the limited programing, let's say you run into a character & try to talk to him, he'll have nothing to say until you get a mission that has you find/talk to him.
Mini Games:
boring, lifeless, only somewhat decent controls. too many whack a moles, skeet ball & crane grab a prize game. only a few rare ones had great dark humor like:
1) slime the ""toys"" that look like kids running around so the monster eats them
2) control a ufo to beam up cows that turn immediately to steaks while watching out for cow pies.
3)using the IR pointer, grab & hold an alien egg in a kid's intestines & follow it up to his mouth while avoiding walls, etc. if you fail, a cartoon alien pops out at you.
Humor/Writing:
I only got this (thankfuly was able to return it to gamestop) when I saw the youtube video showing the ufo/cow & alien game's humor. Also, when talking to some characters, they have suprising things to say. Example: goth kids say they are lonely, or invite you ""to my crypt... well, my mom's basement"" or even say ""I heart stickers"" which is ironic.

Great humor on the hedgestones in the cemetary. Some simple like: ""2 bedrooms available"", ""advertise here"", ""your name here"", ""no vacancies"" or ""get off my lawn.""

Here lies Count Bela; Who got way too much sun; Turned into a puff of smoke; Now his days are done.
In this plot; Rests dearest Suzanne; Didn't die her shoes; Before she ran.
Alexander was buried here; After he drowned; Not that this stops him; From wandering around.

I don't know why I get bought into the hype of spending 60 bucks a year on this thing. Maybe cuz I'm a sucker for NCAA football?  I don't know why I get it though. It's always a buggy mess and 14, while it has some genuine nice things bout it, falls on its face in the quality assurance department. First thing that is wrong. The custom stadium sounds ruin your experience. Each time before a custom sound starts, the audio cuts out completely for 2 seconds or so. It's maddening when a person with lots of sounds and you hear the audio cutting in and out every 15 seconds. Mind you, I can do without my own fight songs/music/chants, but we know how bad E.A.'s presentation continues to be. Commentary continues to be dull and void of anything that stands out but it's to the point where I'm glad I can hit mute. But worst of all. The crowd. Or shall we say? What crowd? Can they be less involved? Did EA go to a high school game and record on a tape recorder with a mono microphone and use that as their atmosphere? I have my crowd up to 100 too. Doesn't matter where ya play, Florida, or Toledo Ohio. You can only picture a college atmosphere in your inner consciousness, because in reality, you got nothing with NCAA Football 14.

 The fight songs are the same generic 5 piece band they've used since NCAA 2002 on PS2. I've truly had it with this garbage. So what about stat screens? well? The stat overlays at half time and end of quarters are ESPN all the way and does give it a tv style presentation. But it doesn't save the rest of it. The life or lackthereof on the sidelines continues to be dead. No pun. Literally. Motionless bodies of sidelined players, cardboard cutouts of cameramen and non-existent of life. Really? This is 2014 NCAA?

 The new infinity engine isn't too bad. Its the best the game has probably felt yet. You can finally interrupt an animation and when a second defender is going after the runner, he can affect the play regardless if the other defender is affecting the base runner. So you can have 2, 3, 4 even 5 guys truly make a difference on a tackle. Running, passing, feels better, blocking is better and I finally feel I can play defense, while it's still broken in parts. With hurry up offense players, it's difficult for a defense to get set as usual. Zone still doesn't seem very effective. DBS still seem to be suckers for curl and slant routes. Especially when you start boosting up the difficulty. Sometimes the CPU QB can go like 100% for 2 quarters and not break a sweat. I recommend lowing the CPU QB sliders to under 40 to make for a more realistic experience. As always, don't bother playing online. Game is unplayable with the unstoppable plays and cheese game that they always ways to exploit this game. E.A. has done nothing to make this a better and fair online experience. Stick with playing with friends or the CPU.

 Graphics are great in spots, downright shoddy in others. The grass/fields look amazing. Animations are well done and the tackles are pretty intense at times. Player models, ehhh, let's just say, they don't look any worse than they did the last 3 years. The stadiums look good, that is until you look at the fans who are the continuous worst looking fans in sports games. They are motionless cardboard cutouts. There is no life on sidelines, at all. No bustling people, no cheerleaders, no cameramen and the players and coaches just stand there like zombies.

 Overall. I do regret spending the 60 bucks this year. I'm already getting bored with it. It still doesn't feel like college football to me do to the poor presentation that E.A refuses to truly improve. If they fix the audio cutting out, that will help. But it can't fix a horrible presentation that has been with this game since the PS2 and XBOX days. Probably better to wait for next gen.

There's nothing I liked about this game, and the only reason I went on as long as I did was to get some easy trophies. I won't lie. But even then, I feel dirty knowing that this thing will show up on my PSN account.

If you didn't play the first game, go do so because it was a little better than this one. But after the events of the first Force Unleashed, Starkiller died, but it turns out that Vader made a bunch of clones of him in case he died, or wanted to have a perfect apprentice. You play as one of those clones, complete with memories from the first game, and tons of Force powers. Granted, you can only really do a few- Force Push, Force Lightning, Force Grip and some other standard fare like throwing your lightsabers (is this even really a 'power'?), air-dashes and more. But Starkiller doesn't want to obey Vader, and breaks out of the cloning room on Kamino, and goes off to discover his identity and find out where his love interest, Juno Eclipse, is. You'll go from level to level, trashing the Empire's troops and ships, and be bored in the process over the span of roughly 6 hours.

Yes, this game can be completed in 6 hours or less. The funny thing is that God of War 3 was the same way, which is just one of the many similarities the two games have. I never thought I'd be defending GoW3, but I have to say, that game was certainly better than this, even with its laughable ""REVENGE!"" lines every 20 minutes. Starkiller's clone is a pretty boring protagonist, and doesn't do nearly as many interesting things or have as many good fights as he did in the first game. The whole game feels rushed, and I knew things were only going to be going downhill after the first 5 minutes when Darth Vader appeared and has one of the worst James Earl Jones impressions ever. I would've taken will.i.am, complete with auto-tune, over this guy. Combat got repetitive fast, and I was using the same two combos over and over to take out most of the enemies in the first few levels and the last ones. A giant ship or walker's launching missiles at you? Deflect them with your lightsaber, as stupid as that might sound. A big armored droid with a shield giving you trouble? Use the Force to take off his shield, hit him with it, then hit him over and over until a QTE pops up where you'll press X, square, and then watch as Starkiller does a 5 second combo all by himself and takes out the droid. You'll fight a lot of these droids, and it's always the same combo. In an action game, the combat should never be boring, and it shouldn't get so bad to the point where I'm praying that I can just Force Push one of these things off a ledge so I can save some time and move on to the next area. There wasn't any challenge with the enemies or bosses. In fact, just like in GoW3, I had more problems with platforming and being able to tell if I was going to make a jump or not. On the harder difficulties, I was already used to playing the game so that the 'improved AI' and more damage didn't affect gameplay much. Heck, you might as well set it to Hard right from the get-go since Normal's so easy. And for anyone wondering about the other God of War similarities, you can click both analog sticks in to go into this crazy attack mode and dish out tons more damage (you'll rarely use this, trust me), there are falling stages just like GoW3's, and the QTEs try so hard to be cool but fall flat each and every time. Again, don't think I loved GoW3 by any means, as I gave it a 3 out of 5, but at least the presentation there worked for its theme. With a Star Wars game, a lot of what's here felt out of place.

I didn't care about the story one bit, and the funny thing is that there's not really any option in going light or dark side until the end, where you can pick one of two options and get either a light or dark ending. Both endings are pretty lame, and I felt ripped off by the story in the end. TFU2 doesn't have much going for it unless you're a die-hard Star Wars fan. It has fairly good graphics, though some of the character models in cutscenes look really weird. The music is the same Star Wars-esque stuff any other SW game gets, and is hardly memorable. There's some DLC for the game now, which adds a tiny bit of time to the 6 hours it takes to beat, but even then, you have to pay for that separately. I can't believe this thing is still selling for full price most of the time, and that anyone bothered with what's easily the worst collector's edition of a game this console generation. If you're really curious about this game, just borrow it from someone who was already suckered into buying it. For the trophy hunters out there, there are a lot of easy ones to get with this game, but your time is best spent elsewhere.

So why the 2 out of 5 if I hated so much about it? Well, the game got so boring for me that it came to a point where I was laughing at how dull it was. It's like that scene near the end of The Protector with Tony Jaa, where more and more thugs are sent to beat him up, eventhough he clearly goes through all of them in a matter of seconds. The same was happening here with Stormtroopers.

Edit: I totally forgot to mention this, and I have no idea how- there's a game-breaking glitch towards the end of the game where you have to remove a battery from a turret. By the time you reach it, there's a 99.99999% chance it'll be destroyed by outside interference from a TIE Fighter.

*********************************************************************************

Diablo 3 isn't garbage, but it's not that great.

I definitely do not think that it is worth $60. If it were $20, that may be a different story.

I'll break it down into pros and cons (tldr below).

Pros:
*Graphics - Personally, I like the graphics. I understand that they're a bit too ""cartoonified"" for some people, but I think they are aesthetically pleasing. The cinematic graphics are awesome as well.

*Voice acting - Okay, see the dialogue con for the other side of this story. I think they chose some good voice actors and these actors did a good job.

*Combat - The combat is the only thing that keeps me playing this game (well, that and friends). There are definitely flaws in the combat system, but overall it is pretty fun. You get a lot of really flashy and exciting abilities and the bosses are pretty neat, especially on higher difficulties.

*Music - Eh, it's decent. I didn't want to put it as a con, but it's far from the best video game music. WoW has a better soundtrack.

Cons:
*Dialogue/writing - The dialogue and writing in this game are awful. Although I think the voice actors were pretty good, a lot of their acting seemed bad because of how silly the writing was. There were so many cliche and corny lines that I thought I was watching an episode of Power Rangers during some of the cinematics (I am justice itself?...)

*Customization (or lack of) - There is no customization in this game. It's absolutely pathetic and makes me think that Blizzard has gone so far downhill that nothing will ever bring them back. ZERO physical customization. Really? How hard would it have been for them to at least let us slightly customize our characters in a game where we are often playing ONLINE? Everyone looks identical. It is boring and incredibly lazy. Whoever decided to scrap physical customization should never work in the gaming industry ever again. There is also next to no class customization either (you can change your abilities whenever). This detracts from the replay value IMMENSELY (as well as the RP potential... actually there is NO RP in this game whatsoever. It might as well just be an action game).

*Controls - The controls are terrible. This was apparent the second I started playing. You have to click to move AND use some of your abilities. I often find myself randomly running around in circles as I'm trying to click on enemies that are moving or clicking on the ground to loot. I notice my friends doing this too and it is pretty entertaining (but annoying and poorly designed).

*Online Requirement - You must be online for single player. Luckily, I find this game mind numbingly boring by myself, so I'm always playing with friends, but it is still immensely annoying (lag and dc's happen to me with an awesome connection; that would bug the hell out of me if I was playing alone).

*Loot - For a game that's centered around loot, you'd think that it would be more exciting. It's not. I guess I expected something like WoW or NWN where you have hundreds to thousands of awesome looking, unique armor and weapons (instead of generic random stuff).

*Repetition - It's just too repetitive. They would have been better off with only 3 difficulties IMO. Having to play the game FOUR TIMES to beat all the difficulties is ridiculous, considering it already gets repetitive during the first play through.

*RL$AH - Just a stupid way for a greedy company to make extra cash. It's a bad idea. I have no idea why anyone would even spend real money on gear for their characters in this game when the gear is so unoriginal anyway. You could buy the best legendary armor with $ but then what are you going to do with it??? The whole point of the game is to GRIND for loot and work your way through the higher difficulties, so this AH defeats the purpose of the game. Why would a gaming company add something that negates the point of their game? (I should also say that I think this will add to the hacking and gold selling market; I'm already seeing the spam in chat and it will only get worse).

*The ending - Perfect example of terrible writing. It was cliche, corny, cheesy, anticlimactic, etc. Act 4 felt rushed, then basically the bad guy dies, hooray we are all happy, humans and angels live together forever omg yay!!! What is this a Disney movie!? Normally at the end of a video game (at least a good one), I feel a sense of happiness and sadness (sad that it's over, happy at how much fun I had with it). At the end of this I felt annoyed.

-Even higher quantities of zombies compared to previous games
-Faster pace compared to previous games
-Faster zombies brings something new to the table

Neutral:
-Photography is back, but honestly, just like in DR1, it doesnt have much involvement in killing zombies. The way they use the camera in the Case Filesis very lazy and repetitive.
-Willamette is large, but looks nothing like it did in the original
-You mileage may vary on the humor in this game.

The bad:
-multiple endings are gone
-overtime is gone (unless you buy the DLC)
-timed missions are gone (unless you buy the DLC)
-escort missions are gone (rescue the survivor, and watch them sprint off to the safehouse)
-zombies latching on to vehicles and hijacking from Dead Rising 3 is gone
-bosses/maniacs are significantly easier to kill even when compared to Dead Rising 3
-Maniacs replace the Psychopaths, which sucks since there are no cutscences to introduce them. The battles composed of killing waves of the Maniacs minions and then killing the Maniac
-healing is instantaneous and can be done on the go
-day/night cycle is gone (day/night only changes based on the current Case File)
-hostile survivors feel like weaker versions of military soldiers
-stealth mechanics are gimmicky
-health regenerates if you get the upgrade
-Food in this game feels homogenous I did not really notice a difference in healing whether it was a water bottle or a medical kit.
-manual saving is gone (replaced with checkpoints)
-Frank acts, sounds, and looks nothing like he did in the previous games
-Obnoxious lines from Frank:

Thats what she said etc, etc,

There were some annoying glitches here and there, but they didn't really affect the main story mode of the game. There is this one instance of the game softlocking, when I was going through the menus too fast.

The game isn't difficult compared to the original Dead Rising. Boss battles and maniacs die surprisingly fast compared to the original. The game has regenerating health, but that is only after you upgrade to it. But I decided not to do that and stayed with the starting health of 500. Even with that self-imposed restriction, I never got killed when progressing through the story with the exception of that one minor difficulty spike in Case 5. But that was due to me having the handicap starting health of 500. There were numerous times where I would have died, but thanks to the new health system of instant consumption of food, I avoided that easily.

Story wise, this is Capcom we are talking about. The story doesnt deviate too much from the previous Dead Risings stories. Essentially, the military and gubberment R EVUL and the gubberment needz MOAR MONEY.

Personally, I feel that the devs are either lying or never played the original Dead Rising when they say Were back to our roots or when they said They wanted to make Frank more mature when considering his obnoxious dialogue. I also personally feel that the whole bringing Frank back, bringing Willamette back, and Were back to our roots was just a marketing tool to get more sales.

Bottom line:

If you want a mindless zombie slaying game, then go ahead and buy.

If you are expecting an experience similar to Dead Rising 1 or hell even Dead Rising 3, then avoid this game.","Shallow fun, plus Capcoms Scummy tactics",1481932800,5,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

This game could have been so fun, but........So, the graphics aren't great to start with for the 3DS. They are fuzzy looking. The idea is to pass a level and then after you pass that level, you go back twice more to do the challenges for that level. The challenges consist of a race against the clock to see if you can get through quickly without dying. Ok, that isn't so bad. You don't have to pick up every object to race through and beat it. The part that I detest is the ""Missions"" challenge. This isn't even fun. In order to pass the missions challenge you have to get every single object and kill every single thing. The problem is that if you fall, even once, you have to start all over. The issue I have with that is that some levels are very long and very hard. So, one level I was doing takes about 45 minutes IF you go very slow to ensure you get every single thing and to be very careful not to fall. If you spend 25 minutes and you fall once, back to the beginning. I did this about 10 times and said, ""Forget it."" It became a chore and it lost it's fun. Now, if you want to skip the missions and just go through the levels, it isn't bad. I also found the constant directions annoying.

What isn't good is when you are on level 16 and they are still showing you by popping these boxes up in front of your view telling you how to kick. I got that back at the beginning and now it is annoying. I gave it 2 stars because I love the music and the concept is fun.

2.0,True,"12 20, 2013",AJO9E61MYH6ST,B00AXI9XIE,Joel Ford,"Well, the game is fun. Especially with kids. I'll give it that. However, it fails on several key fronts:

First, there is no reason that this game should have been tied to a toy franchise. The toys merely unlock characters in the game. No significant data is stored on them, and leveling them up does nothing for the characters themselves other than incrementing a numeric value. From a collector's perspective or a child's perspective, it might be nice to have figurines to show off or play with, but from a gamer's perspective, this is an entirely egregious use of resources and a rip-off to boot. They could have made the same game without the portal of power knock-off and the toys that go along with it, charged less money, and focused more resources on improving on the game itself, which is lacking, in the end. The Toy Story 3 game, which this one was clearly based on, was great, affordable, and provided fantastic game-play, both linear and open ended. Disney infinity is a stumble in the a half-right, half-wrong direction.

Second off, the creative toy box mode is extremely limited and totally buggy. You cannot fill your toy box with much before it maxes out and forces you to delete things if you want to add more. You cannot make anything you create in it interactive beyond the built-in interactivity of the objects you place; you can't create missions, or dialog, or set up any sort of logic-triggered events. And it often breaks. Many times have I placed an object and wanted to move it around and found it permanently fixed in space with no way to select it. This is one of several unacceptable glitches in this mode that make it frustrating more than fun, more stifling than freeing.

Finally, co-op presents many missed opportunities. I love couch co-op, I love playing video games with my kid. This one is pretty fun for a little while. Still, forcing you to buy more toys to unlock specific characters in order to even play co-op after you're already spent 70$ on the game is an insult. See, you can't bring characters from different movies into each others' worlds. This right here is a huge missed opportunity for fun. What's more, there is no co-op specific content. There are no vehicles that can carry two people. There are no missions requiring two players, co-operation, or that particularly benefit from being carried out by two people other than you might finish them faster which means you likely have to split up anyways.

Again, it can be fun for kids. Disney Infinity is more creative than its obvious counterpart, Skylanders, provides more interest methods of travel throughout its worlds, and is a fine way to distract or spend an evening with your kid. But it doesn't really live up to its promises, and takes on the excessively wasteful and expensive baggage of real world toys without any clear reason or obvious benefit other than to make more money.","Fun, but misses several key marks",1387497600,23,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PLAYSTATION 3'}",

~ gameplay encourages evasion. not a bad thing for survival horror.
- terrible story. they keep you in the dark as much as possible and 1/4th of the way through the game decide to do a giant exposition dump on you within the same minute.
- just a gigantic dump of enemies everywhere. I know it's because they want to make you evade and use the beef jerky (ugh), but it's not fun. it looks messy and is just annoying more than anything.
- some environments are red and muddled to the point that you can't see ANYTHING. you'll know what I'm talking about because you won't be able to see any of the doors on the walls.
- ONE HIT KILL SCENARIOS ARE EVERYWHERE. so many times I questioned if I was going the right way then I just died instantly to a cut scene. this happened multiple times and I never went, ""oh that's fair that was my bad"". I always felt blindsided by them.
- THIS GAME FREEZES YOUR CONSOLE!! Wow I can't believe this one. In the span of the few hour playthrough for this game I had to HARD RESET my ps3 5 times. FIVE TIMES! That's five too many!
- Riddles are mostly boring and forgettable. There is maybe one or two in the game that are alright.

Furthermore units are so small that they often are barely noticeble unless you zoom all the way in, meaning battles will often look rather silly, like tiny specs of animated color shooting at one another.

 Although the maps are huge, and I mean huge, the space given within the maps is uneccassery at best. the armies often comrpise no more than 100 units per side, and given the units tiny size, this does not require a great deal of space. So what is all the space for? Frankly, I have no idea.

 the controls in this game are clunky, especially when playing online when you cant pause. While yes, it is possible ot give a group of units very complex orders via the shift key system in place, these orders take a bit of time to issue, even when you are very eperinced with the system, meaning online play, which in RTS game is fast paced by nature, becomes rather difficult to pull off.

Having been a huge System Shock 1 fan, I was first in line (pretty much literally, too) to buy this sequel when it was released, and for the most part I absolutely loved it.
Now let me qualify ""for the most part"".  That means everything until about three major levels before the end, at which point the game completely buried itself.  To this day, I even remember the specific point at which I realized it had passed the point of non-redemption: where you found several very tall columns sliding up and down that were supposed to be (ahem) ""teeth"", and you had to jump across them a la 80's side-scroller.  The ending of this game (along with the couple of levels immediately preceding it) was so incredibly god-awful that I have to ding not 1, not 2, but *3* stars.  It it just that bad.
An ending this bad, that ruins what was a masterpiece of a game leading up to it, is nothing new in computer games.  In fact, one of the highest-profile examples of it is quite similar to SS2, and that is Half-Life.  Now, if you're the type that's able to overlook a game's ending and enjoy just portions of the journey for their own sake, then you'll likely enjoy this game more than 2 stars' worth.

Golden Axe: Beast Rider attempts to put a new spin on Sega's classic series, and utterly fails.  Playing as returning heroine Tyris Flare, you are on a journey of revenge against the evil Death Adder.  There are hordes of enemies to duke it out with and dismember, but the game is pretty much a bore from beginning to end.  Not because of the gameplay itself per se, but just how the game is designed.  There are some good looking environments and effects, but much of what you see in Golden Axe just looks bland.  It doesn't help that the game's controls are awkward (and occasionally unresponsive) during combat, and especially when trying to handle the game's assortment of beasts.  The few high points of Golden Axe are that the game is quite brutal in terms of bloody violence, and there is a decently lengthed quest as well.  Getting through it however is a different story all together.  One last thing though: where is the co-op mode?  I seem to remember half the fun of the old Golden Axe games was teaming up with a pal, and there is no such thing to be found here.

2.0,False,"06 26, 2008",A27DBJIUZE53G4,B00139WJPQ,Kim Wallace,"When I first heard about this game, I was excited for an interactive visual novel on the DS.  I was even more pumped when I saw it involved a detective.  I think everybody has had that secret fantasy of uncovering a case-- trench coat and all.  Unfortunately, Jake Hunter: Detective Chronicles doesn't provide you much satisfaction in living out the detective dream.

It's a shame, too, because the game seemed to have so much potential. After all, the gist of the game is pressing witnesses, finding clues, exploring leads, and solving crimes.  And to top it off, it allows players to take on the role of Jake Hunter, a Marlboro smoking, strong willed, quick witted detective, who deep down has a soft side.  Wait, did that sound familiar?  That's probably because it's stereotypical detective traits.  That should have been my first clue that there was nothing ""novel"" about this interactive visual novel.

Not just Hunter, but all of the characters are bland.  Even Hunter's assistant, Yulia, who the game tries so hard to give a supporting role to, is dull and seems more like a puppet muttering generic responses to Hunter.  After a while, the repetition becomes so tiresome, you may wish you didn't have to talk to the girl at all.  And it's not just with Yulia; it's with the majority of the characters that you have to talk to move the plot forward.

It wouldn't be so bad if the plot was something that you were so fixated in that you just had to advance it at any cost.  It's not even worth the expense of sitting through all the lackluster dialogue, typical jazzy detective music, and the uninspiring scenery.  Wait a minute, isn't this an interactive visual novel?  Isn't the narrative what should drive the entire game?  Yes, and that is probably the biggest problem with Jake Hunter:  Detective Chronicles.  The three cases you have to solve aren't intriguing enough to save the game.  Actually, there really isn't even that much of a mystery to be solved with half of them because they are predictable.  You'll pretty much have the case figured out before you get half way through it, and in this case, that's about 30 minutes in.  In fact, you'll probably have the game beat within 5-6 hours with no replay value (I can't see why you'd want to put yourself through these unoriginal cases again).

To add to all this mess, the gameplay isn't fun either.  The game is about as linear as it can get.  You can't move around or explore the atmosphere; instead you tap a button that tells you what it looks like.  You don't even have much of a choice in how you respond to the questions you're asked or what you can ask people.  If you pick the wrong choice, Hunter tells you he doesn't think that's the correct statement and forces you to pick the right comment.  To top off this big pile of boring, at the end of the day, you are quizzed on all of the facts about the case.  The quizzes just state the obvious and are a big waste of time.  I'm left to wonder, is this the best they could do to make the game interactive?

So, does the Jake Hunter:  Detective Chronicles even give you back the investment of your time and effort?  No.  My advice is that there are far better games on the DS worth your time.  A story driven game that is not more innovative than something a high school student could write (and also edit, there are some obvious spelling and grammatical mistakes) just doesn't cut it.",No Detective Dream Here...,1214438400,12,,

But perhaps the most reasonable explanation to all that could very well be that western games stink. The only bright spots that come to mind are Lucas Art's Outlaws and Konami's Sunset Riders. So attempting at all cost to bring the cowboy back into the picture, perennial controversial-spurring-favorites Rockstar Games have planted for us in the gaming soil Red Dead Revolver.

o discuss Red Dead Revolver without bringing up an issue of just how much explicit graphical nature this game has would be almost unheard, especially taken from the game company that gave us Manhunt and Gran Theft Auto. Much to my surprise, this game didn't really have anything that was over-the-top, it was all kept to a minimum.

You start the game as Red, the lone gunman whose pa' was killed when he was just a young 'un. Much like Conan the Barbarian revenge upon your father's grave is the primary focus for igniting the plot. Think Conan, just not as many governors and well, more sheriffs. The games story mode doesn't play anything similar to Gran Theft Auto, so cancel out any assumption that you'll be robbing people of their wagons and horses to cruise around town--instead the levels are condensed to linear and very tight surroundings. In addition to playing as Red, about 1/4 of the way to finishing the games many levels you'll take control of an additional character, who plays just the same.

Regardless of which character you play as, Red Dead Revolver is a standard action game dressed in a cowboy costume. You manuever around the playing field taking cover from enemy fire, thanks in large part to the backgrounds this isn't much of a problem. What did annoy me was how unresponsive the controls were--Rockstar took a gamble by creating a control scheme too different than everyone elses. The finished results are unpleasent; by moving around with one analog and aiming your gun with the other poses a seroius problem when faced with numerous enemies. Also the inability to quickly change the camera freely led me on many occassions to die without ever knowing who was the culprit responsible for my death. There is a brief moment when you are allowed to use more firepower then usual. This mode is called 'Dead Eye', when you have accumulated the points for ""bullet time"" you can press a button and slow down the camera in a Matrix fashion. Doing so allows you to chain six seperate hit points on the enemies body, after that you can send them straight to the ground. My conclusion on this is, the ability itself sure is useful but a little more creativity would've been nicer. Then at final praise, comes the dualing action the game offers which happens at scripted times of the game. It attempts to simulate a classic gun duel, and to some degree succeeds in authenticating this as a western game. You pull back the analog stick to grab your gun, push it forward to point it at the bad guys, and then giving you a short amount of time to try aiming for the sweet spots before all hell breaks loose. It's a novel concept, but the fact that you can't actually decide when to use it turns it into nothing more than a flashy gimmick.

If I were to choose a version I would go with the Xbox edition, merely based on visuals. The game is a little more polished and the resolution is a few pixels higher, but in the end both PS2 and Xbox versions of Red Dead Revolver suffer from low frame-rates and glitchy looking character models. Character models that a first grader can make out of wooden blocks and construction paper. And some levels really do heighten the amount of suspense higher than what is really offered, take the train stage for example. The music is decent, there are those same tunes that flavored Kill Bill Vol. 2 so well. Too bad the voice acting has to go and screw things up, when I say it's bad I mean its' really BAD. The writing is also poorly done, I understand this is only a game but with so many standards furthering the crossing of movie and game dynamics, cheesy voice acting just doesn't cut it. With a little more freedom to whatever you want to do, better graphics and a more understandable controls--Red Dead Revolver could've been a top choice action game.

I've been looking forward to a racing game on the PS4 since launch, and Drive Club was extremely disappointing, and unfortunately this game doesn't live up to the hype either. Here's the deal: Many of the reviewers point out the lack of offline features, and although that's a mistake on the developer's part, people knew this coming in. So for the sake of argument, let's pretend I enjoy always being online and don't dwell on the fact that during a race I simply can't leave the room for a second using the pause function that exists practically in every game in existence - with the exception of MMOs. Let's say I can tolerate the horrid AI that unfairly rubberbands past the car mashup it caused 2 miles back, and passes me around the second to last bend to win the race. And for a second, let's hold it together and.. never-mind, the last two points pretty much made this game the 2 stars it deserves.

I enjoy everything about the series, and Underground 2 and Most Wanted were the pinnacle of greatness when it came to arcade racing, so like many of us, I looked forward to the various combinations of previous games to form the latest release. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to smile about when playing this game. The cars are gorgeous, the touge is really fun to drift through (otherwise, the whole LA thing is really overplayed), the selection is passable - they really should have included more models, no 04-07' STi? Bummer.. Kudos on the MR, though. The constant cellphone going off every second is beyond annoying - and although many reviewers expressed a growing adoration for the characters, I just found it really cheesy and ended up skipping scenes to avoid the same replayed content with different dialogue.

+Great graphics
+Great customization
+Touge drifts are exciting
+Different challenge types keeps the game feeling fresh
+Money is relatively easy to come by
+Handling is great, as is the ability to fine-tune your car for grip/drift, fantastic feature.

-Always online, need I say more.
-Terrible AI
-Tiny car selection, you didn't include dashes - shouldn't have skimped on cars.
-LA again? really?
-Police chases are boring, I had to constantly stop and let the police catch up, and then fish for more. Roadblocks were useless. Extremely disappointing considering this was a great selling point for the title.
-In-game players don't care to play with you; it's a racing game where the rewards for winning a race against you aren't incentivized enough to motivate the player to choose you over the story, or doing time trials, or event. Playing this game for 15 hours, I've realized how single player it really is, ironically while online. If you're playing with your Crew, it might be a different setting altogether. And maybe the issue isn't helped with so few players on such a large map.

Overall, 2/5. There's definitely things I really enjoyed while playing. It's not by any means unbearable, and you'll find yourself really taken by the level of detail, the constant changing weather, and seeing that random stranger pass you by as they wipe out, but there's just too many problems that overshadow what could have been a great game. I don't feel a sense of story or purpose, I just jump from race to race, and although we can make the argument this is racing, and purely that, there's still a creative approach to tying your sense of drive into the game, and making you feel connected.

Pros: Great sound, great battery life, 100% wireless compatible with Xbox1 (no wires needed to controller), comfortable, light, cloth doesn't sweat like the leather muffs do, they don't turn off if I am being social and not actually using my controller when the controller turns off.

I am amending this review I have had these for a while now and as others have complained above and below, the arms that slide and hold the headphones have cracked and are starting to break.

2.0,False,"10 12, 2005",A3GRU9732S4V1U,B00021HBP4,Robert,"As anyone reading this review is doubtless aware, this game is based on the third installment in the Harry Potter movie franchise, which is in turn based off the third book in the Harry Potter series.  This one concerns the third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley as they attend class, learn new spells, fight various enemies, and - by the way - deal with the fact that the notorious wizard criminal, Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban prison with the intent to murder young Mr. Potter, and he is being pursued by Dementors, which are Ringwraith-like creatures that act as prison guards and they are intent on recapturing Sirius Black, and woe to anyone who gets in their way.

This is my second foray into the world of Harry Potter gaming.  About a year ago I played Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which was a great (though not perfect) game with a well-realized, immersive Hogwarts, lots of challenging combat, fun sidequests and mini-games, Quidditch matches, good-looking graphics, and engaging puzzles.  I went in to Prisoner of Azkaban expecting more of the same.  I was rudely shocked, to say the least.

But before I get into the negative, let's talk about the positive.  In this game, you control Harry, Ron, and Hermione at various times, and each of the three has different strengths and abilities.  Harry has access to the Marauder's Map, which allows you to see mini-maps or the levels, complete with secret passageways and locations of other characters and enemies.  Harry is also able to jump gaps, climb ropes, and is generally the most acrobatic of the trio.  Ron can find secret doors and items.  Hermione can access tight spaces that the others can't.  In addition, though this game offers many spells to be learned and used, most of them can only be used by one or another of the three characters (though the basic spells are common to all three).  All of this does make for a more varied gameplay experience, and adds a certain amount of depth to the (still too easy) puzzle-solving.  Another positive thing about the game is the Expecto Patronus spell, which allows Harry to conjure up a Patronus to use against the Dementors.  This is very well done and is the most enjoyable thing in the game, although controlling the Patronus effectively will take some getting used to.  But that's about it as far as positives go.

Combat in this game is much easier than before.  Your Expelliarmus spell for defense will almost never be used.  The basic approach to any enemy is just cast Filipendo at it over and over again until it goes down.  This is complicated by the fact that your lock-on targeting system in clearly flawed in this game, as many times you will attempt to target an enemy and lock on to an inanimate object instead.  A couple of the enemies are slightly more challenging, but for the post part it is just point and shoot.  This even applies to the several times you will encounter Draco Malfoy in the game.  Malfoy is no more difficult to defeat than any other enemy in the game.  This doubtless makes the game easier for young players, but it was a disappointment for me.

The puzzles in the game are very easy for the most part.  They are made even easier by the fact that the characters will continuously shout out things like ""I wonder what that button does, maybe you should push it!"" or ""Hey Ron, why don't you cast Lumos Duo on that object over there?"" or other such things.  So if you should ever experience some momentary hesitation about what to do next, don't worry - the game will spill the beans quickly enough.

The most annoying thing about the game is the fact that, whichever of the three characters you are playing, the other two will constantly run along behind you shouting unhelpful and annoying remarks.  For example, when you have completed all the tasks assigned to you for a level, but you need to explore the castle a bit, the characters will gripe about how tired they are and how they want to go to bed approximately every 5 seconds.  Or if you should ever deviate from the shortest path through a level, they will start spouting off about how you're going the wrong way.  This will drive you insane in a hurry.  I can't believe EA thought this was a good idea.  At the least you should have an option to turn the voices off.

The mini-games in this game are dull to say the least.  As I said before, there is no Quidditch, in fact you don't touch a broomstick in the game.  Yes, you do get to fly Buckbeak aimlessly around the castle grounds if you desire, but this is a very poor substitute.  The other mini-games are pointless and boring, and one of them, Owl Racing, was apparently deisgned as torture for your fingers, since you have to tap a button over and over again in a precise rhythm for several minutes in order to make your owl flap her wings and fly.  I did it one time and never again, since I don't particularly enjoy finger cramping.

Graphically and sound-wise the game is also below par.  Most of the characters look and sound nothing like their movie counterparts.  The worst is Professor Snape.  I don't know who did his voice acting, but they could have gotten the guy who does Spongebob Squarepants and it would have sounded better.  Of course, you don't hear much of his voice anyway, since every time you encounter him outside of Potions class in the game, he will look at you and immediately go into a fit of coughing and hacking - bascially Snape has a year-long bout of emphysema in this game.  What is up with that?

You spend far too much time in this game staring at loading screens.  Every time you open a door, even to enter the tiniest room - loading screens.  Running from outside the front door of Hogwarts to Gryffindor tower takes about 2 minutes of play time and about 90 seconds of staring at a loading screen.  This is far too much, and EA really needs to fix this recurring problem in their Potter games.  Other simiar games don't have this problem, why should this one?  It certainly isn't the great graphics.

Outdoors is another disappointment.  Yes, you can fly Buckbeak over a complete version of Hogwarts, but, except for the relocated front door, it is the exact same building and grounds layout as in the last game.  In addition, in the last game, the grounds were inhabited by lots of students running around the castle, which did a lot for the immersion factor of the game.  Here, there is no one outside at all.  It's almost enough to make you feel lonely, running over the huge grounds all alone.  Also, in previous games, exploring the grounds and castle had a purpose - there were secret items all over the place waiting to be found.  Here, there is nothing beyond one or two chests with Wizard cards.  Outdoor exploration was one of the best things about Chamber of Secrets, but in this game it is yet another disappointment.

Overall, this game let me down severely.  It's like EA decided that, since the Harry Potter games were intended for younger players and Chamber of Secrets might have been too difficult for them, they decided to make Prisoner of Azkaban much easier and get rid of all the fun and challenge and, in the process, most of the ""Hogwarts"" atmosphere.  (Although, young kids will probably have a lot of trouble with the Patronus spell).  Unless you just have to play every game with the Potter name on it, avoid this one.  Play Chamber of Secrets instead.  Let's hope that Goblet of Fire is better.",Is it bad?  Not really.  Is it good?  Not really.,1129075200,8,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

You get a generic cut and paste reply from support, or see dozens of people being silenced and get trouble on the public forums reporting the similar problems.

The wallet power is pretty strong in Tera, don't be fooled by free2pay label.  It's pay2win. The flip side is if you have little time to play. You can purchase the best gear in the game, instantly level to 58 without actually playing, and easily beat down skilled players with your credit card. Obviously this kills the spirit of fair sportsmanship or those who legitimately want to play the game. Also if you don't log in every day, your character becomes crippled and it can take up to a week to get back full strength.  These kind of desperate gimmicks are what made facebook game unpopular and manipulative. They have no place in MMOs and tera feels past it's prime.

Overall tera can be fun, unfortunately it's diminished by over zealous corporate greed and neglect at times.  Don't just take my word for it. Look at the empty EU servers, gameforge reviews since 2013 or racist comments on NA eme public forums.

There just isn't enough here to keep you going after a few hours.

I love exploration games and while some of the planets can be quite beautiful they all end up just looking like palette swaps since everything else looks the same.

The upgrades for your equipment are plentiful, but they all seem kind of useless. All you will really care about is adding new slots to your Exosuit, ship, and Multi-tool so you can mine more materials.

It's just not worth $60 IMO. Had Hello Games released NMS as a $20 indie game I think it would have been OK to have such a lack of things to do in this game. Games like Proteus prove that there is a fan base for the art inspired exploration for exploration's sake.

Had they come through on everything they promised it would have been a very different game.

**UPDATE**
I've been experiencing numerous lockups and other issues with this game. This rate of freezing and locking up is inexcusable.
It takes the complete fun out of the game when you spend an hour mining a rare mineral only to have the game freeze up before you get a chance to save.

I was really impressed wiht this game when I first played it. Except it was called ""Tomb Raider"" bck then. And that's all this is, Tomb Raider with a slight face lift. The storyline is basically the same: run around ancient places doing flips and sommersaults, and avoiding trips. That's EXACTLY what you do in Prince of Persia. The only difference is that youfight more NPCs. This actually detracts from PoP because the combat system is so weak. Gameplay on the PC is very awkward and difficult. Instead of space bar causing you to jump, it causes you to sommersault. For anyone with experience playing FPS or basically ANY game, the space bar should be reserved for jumping. But as I said, the combat is very weak. You can't run from monsters, and you can't really do many special attacks. Besides what the game may say, most of the attacks are the same, they just look different. I dreadedthe combat system because it was so boring. I just hit random keys until the guys died.

Special save points. UNlike Tomb Raider, this game has pre-set save points, which means you're pretty much forced to get to a certain area before you quit, or you lose everything you did. Some may like this feature, I found it annoying. If the game had been challenging AND fun I wouldnt have minded it, but having to redo everything was just a pain.

Lastly, the absolute worst thing about this game is the movement. Unlikle other games, the moue does not control your character, it controls the camera angle. This makes for some VERY disorienting game play. Long-time gamers will have a lot to get used to if they pick up this game. What's more, many times I found myself thrown into angles thta made it almost impossible to play or see where I was going. Several times the camera would go into a wall and no amount of moving the mouse would get a better shot. I just had to restart. That is the main reason this game is inferior to Tomb Raider. While this game might work on the PS2, it ports over to PC very poorly.

If you have never played Tomb Raider, you may find ""Sands of Time"" exciting. But considering when it came out, it should have had much better graphics, an easier skill set, and a better storyline.

I use a Nexus 7 tablet and was surprised how conveniently it was compact into a small case with both the controller and a kickstand for the tablet. It felt awkward at first but I very quickly got used to it and it was truly a joy to use!

The instructions for pairing it seemed unintuitive but the first time I paired it, I was surprised how quickly it just began working.

Then (because of input limitations on Android) I unpaired it to use the keyboard real fast. Of course normally this little inconvenience would have been something I could easily see past. I'm not difficult to please.

Unfortunately that's when the trouble began. My Nexus 7 recognized it as a device that could be paired, however it wouldn't pair. I checked the instructions and did everything it said. I even turned everything off, tablet and all, and tried to start from a clean slate. I even tried completely forgetting the controller in the Bluetooth list. Nothing was pairing.

I then began looking all over the internet for a solution. Nothing came up. Some posts about Android 4.2 not performing correctly with Bluetooth but an issue supposedly resolved in 4.2.1, seeing as I wasn't having any other Bluetooth related issues.

After stumbling upon whole forum posts and reviews of people having then exact problem I was having, with not even so much as a factory reset fixing it, I took the device back.

It's a great little accessory... until it completely stops functioning. Not due to bad hardware, but poor software integration. Pity.

After playing this game and not being able to finish it, I can say that I am nothing but disappointed. I'll start with the good:

-Graphics are fantastic. We're not talking high-end PC graphics but good for a Sniper Elite game;
-Sound effects are top notch;
-Big, wide open levels with many different routes to take;

Now for the bad..

-The game is PLAGUED with bugs and glitches. On several occasions I could not finish a level because the game would just freeze, causing me to have to restart my PS4 only for it to freeze again moments after re-starting the game;

-Animations are awful. Moving from cover to running, turning corners, close quarter kills, the animations are blocky and VERY low quality;

-The X-ray kill cam does not offer what the game advertised. Only certain points of the body can be seen breaking because of the bullet and the anatomy of a person is not very detailed at all. Sometimes the sound of a bullet striking an enemy will play before the bullet actually does and the camera sometimes goes above the enemy causing you not to see the kill at all;

-You have to play several levels into the game before ANY weapon customization options become available;

-Enemies have an auto lock-on. If a tank or foot soldier sees you and begins to shoot, they can not miss;

-The AI in the game is awful. Enemies make NO attempt to find cover and will blindly run out in the open to be killed;

-The AI will sometimes reset during a firefight. An enemy will one second be shooting at you determined to take you out, and the next they stand up out of cover and begin to walk away like normal..oblivious to the fact that their allies are dying and they were just in a gunfight.

-Levels are the same color, same art, same type of environment. You get one game setting: desert. Nothing else but different variations of a desert.

And if one really believes that the price was too small... never worry, micro transactions really add up to something and do so quickly. And how 'micro' is a $20 micro transaction? Well, if it feels like less than pocket change, $99.99 will buy you enough in-game moneys to keep you going for a few hours.

When the item arrived it came in nicely designed package and the actual controller looked great, unfortunately from there I had nothing but problems.
As I held the controller in my hands, the weight was nice but the buttons immediately felt stiff. It's been a long time since I held a Genesis controller but my muscle memory just knew the buttons required more pressure than the OEM Sega controller. This is especially true of the A, B, & C buttons as the top row always had a little extra stiffness on even original controllers. This wasn't ideal but it wasn't a deal breaker either.
When I tried to plug the controller in, it wouldn't go into the port. I tried gently attempting different angles (for fear of breaking the pins on my console) but there was one or more pins not allowing it to go in; I tried the 2nd control port and had the same problem and later tested both ports on another system with no luck. A careful inspection of the connector leads me to believe that one particular connector (the top left pin if looking at the holes on the connector) is defective. Most people who reviewed this item didn't have my problem so I assume the it's not incredibly common. I also want to add that that there are far less reliable brands than Hyperkin.
I would have just exchanged the defective controller for another until I learned of a far superior alternative.

I purchased BFBC in July, 2008 after playing the excellent demo on the Playstation Network. I've had over 6 months to play the game and in that time serious issues have not been addressed by the developer - DICE Studios or Electronic Arts, the publisher of the game.

The Battlefield series has always been first and foremost an online shooter. BFBC is different in 2 ways. First, it adds a single player campaign and second it features destructible environments. The single player campaign is adequate though somewhat of a distraction from the ""meat"" of the game which is clearly the online portion.

The single player campaign puts you in the boots of a U.S. Army soldier assigned to the proverbial ""B-squad"". Your squad consists of delinquents, has-beens and all-around rejects from the rest of the Army. You'll have various objectives to accomplish in the war-zone you're in before being allowed to go home. The story although not compelling is entertaining and the AI characters are actually funny in parts. All in all I used the single player campaign as practice before jumping online.

And online is where the game has major problems. First and foremost a game like BFBC is all about squad communication and tactics. Inexplicably the game features very, very poor voice chat support. You are limited to only speaking with members of your immediate squad (4 players total). You have no way of communicating with other members of different squads, even on the same team. Coordinating attacks or defense is severely limited because of it. Also, even through various game updates the voice chat is hopelessly broken. Some rounds you might actually get lucky and have the voice chat work only to discover it won't in the next.

As if that weren't bad enough BFBC does not run stably or reliably online. Lag is so severe that the game sporadically freezes for 2-5 seconds at a time. Try playing a shooter with lag this severe and you'll quickly realize that it's a futile effort.

Other problems including a complete lack of online game modes also hamper the game. Initially BFBC only included one game mode - Gold Rush. It's essentially a spin on traditional sabotage games. You are either a 'defender' or 'attacker' and must either destroy or defend crates of gold. A few months after release, BFBC was updated with a new game mode called 'Conquest'. In Conquest mode, the aim is to reduce the opposing team's tickets to zero. Killing an enemy soldier depletes one ticket per kill, while capturing control points on the map causes enemy tickets to count down.

Beyond those problems I am also disappointed in the level variety in BFBC. Some levels truly shine and feature enough variety in vehicles and terrain to cater to all types of combat. Other levels are claustrophobic, poorly planned, feature no vehicles and are layered in annoying fog. The feeling I get playing the latter is that the developer quickly padded the game with extra maps sacrificing quality for quantity.

I should point out that I tried resolving the various lag and voice-chat issues through EA's technical support. Unfortunately for me it seems that it's the game itself that is at fault as no one from EA was able to offer any viable solution. I'll also add that I use a broadband 6mb/sec. connection from Comcast. I play several other games online with no problems on the same PS3. It seems like the issues are entirely contained within the game itself.

Overall I am of course disappointed with the game. What should have been the blockbuster title of the summer fizzled out as many players experiencing the same problems I described above have left for better games. The support from EA and DICE to BFBC has been almost non-existent leaving many gamers with an almost unplayable game.

2. Characters look awful. All of them look warped somehow, especially Ken whom they've had to remake a model for because of how bad he looked. Only Ryu and Chun-li look acceptable.
3. Work for colors now. Old games would either come with all the colors OR you'd have to play the game a lot and unlock colors for your costumes. Now you either have to buy it(nope) or attempt to get them in small amounts through survival.
4. No more arcade. I mean come on. When we weren't playing online or locally with others, chances are we were doing trials, training or doing arcade. Now that's been replaced with a boring story and they've only added trials far after release date so I'm not even counting that.
5. DLC. I mean I already don't like the game so paying for characters who should have been in the game from the start does not sit well with me. Yeah you have fight money but geezus you gotta grind all their crappy modes so hard just to try to scrap up enough for 2 characters and then you've pretty much screwed yourself out of buying a costume or something.

In some places, all the movement from one scenario to the other is a cinematic set piece, so there is little problem solving necessary, which is part of the fun  of these games for me.  The player is then thrust into a shootout, without any familiarity with the locale.

obviously, there's no comparing this title to its predecessor, ""Resistance: FoM."" however, you'd expect a sequel to, in most -- but not all -- cases, surpass the original. unfortunately, ""Resistance 2"" doesn't just fall short of surpassing its predecessor, it falls flat on its face (although i do like the campaign/multiplayer control customization feature).

the graphics are beyond *tired*, the transitions ungraceful, with horribly unrealistic weapon mechanics -- albeit, creativity in the armament department isn't lacking -- and the storyline is linear and predictable. i was hoping this game would tide me over until ""Resistance 3"" dropped (which, in turn, was intended to tide me over until ""Battlefield 3"" dropped), but i really don't think i can handle playing it all the way through.

i couldn't help but wonder how much money was spent to get the rating quotes on the front; e.g., ""5 out of 5"" and ""9.5 out of 10."" it occurred to me that these quotes may have been completely fabricated, or that, maybe, 2008 was just a really, really bad year for game releases; i don't know as i can't remember that far back.

This is a great ambidextrous mouse for left-handed use.

right-handed mouse, then switch to left handed when you log in and the driver loads.

Also, the mouse isn't grey at all.  When you get it it's more like a shiny black chrome color.

I figured after browsing the web a bit, reading the news and paying some bills online, I could flip it over and get down with an impromptu gaming session.  When I opened the package, I was impressed by the slick styling and texture of the mouse.  The battery cover feels fragile and sounds like it's going to snap into pieces when removed, but after several removals to store the USB receiver, it still seems fine. I tried the mouse on a 64-bit Windows 7 system first.  Five minutes into using this in mouse mode, I couldn't take it anymore and removed it from the system.  Mouse clicks failed to register, the mouse pointer was scattershot and it was just a plain horrible experience.  I didn't even try any other modes initially because if it can't work as a capable mouse on my 64-bit system, everything else is moot.  However, I did come back later and test the gamepad in 64-bit.  So, in fairness, I figured I'd try again on 32-bit Win 7 system.  On the 32-bit system, the mouse worked fine.  The mouse was just as capable as the wireless mouse normally used on that PC. I decided to try the different modes so I referred to the manual.  This thing must have been written by people with 20-10 eyesight because it has the smallest font I've ever seen in a printed manual.  I'm not exaggerating; I literally used a magnifying glass to read it.

After determining which buttons to press to switch modes, I tried remote control mode first.  Well, the mouse works okay on 32-bit, which is a good thing because the remote sure doesn't.  After successfully switching to remote mode, I tried volume, play, forward, reverse.  Nothing, nada, zilch.  No songs launched, no volume adjusted... nothing happened at all.  I mashed away at buttons in futility and Just when I was ready to give up hope, I pressed the ""power"" button (the one on the bottom that is part of the remote control, not the one on the side, which controls the main power), Well, that one button worked because it turned off my PC.  I powered it back on and tried again.  This time I even launched iTunes and Windows Media Player manually to try to nudge it along. Still, nothing.  I finally gave up and decided to try the gamepad.

As a gamepad, the buttons are kind of awkwardly placed.  By awkward, I mean my hand feels a bit cramped when holding it.  The controller was detected in my games with no problem and I was able to assign buttons and play without any issues.  Although it functioned as a capable controller, it just had an overall generic feel compared to a dedicated programmable controller.  I guess after playing with Xbox/PS3 style controllers on PC for so long, it's hard to go back to a small cramped controller with closely spaced buttons, especially when playing games that require rapid precise movements and actions.  I would likely only use a gamepad like this when traveling if I wanted to pack light and avoid carrying both a mouse and gamepad.

In the end, had this been a purchased item instead of a Vine review, I would have very likely ultimately returned it.  It is an ambitious design and a very good idea but the execution is just a little off and the performance is too inconsistent.  I'm curious to try it on my Mac and likely will do so once I get the Mac back from repair.  It didn't like my Win 7 64-bit PC at all and only liked my Win 7 32-bit PC a tad bit better.  If I had to grade each aspect of the controller I'd give the mouse a B on Win 7 32-bit, and F on Win 7 64-bit.  Remote control N/A on 64-bit (since it was not tried after mouse failed to work properly) and D- on Win 7 32-bit (would have scored another F had the one lone power button also failed to work).

I like that they've tried something new, and others seem to really like this, but I could not stand it. I feel if they wanted to go the route of trying to mimic a mouse, they should have used a small rollerball instead. The touchpad area is too large, and trying to use the triggers caused me to swipe the pad in another direction while pulling the trigger button, making me miss what I was aiming for. Very innaccurate, especially for FPS's. At least for me it was.

I grew up with mouse and keyboard games, have grown accustom to console game controllers, and feel pretty fluid with both systems. But this is something completely different. Again, I applaud them for thinking of something different, but if you're on the fence on whether you'll like this or not, I'm going to guess it'll most likely fall on the side of ""or not."" I had my doubts, and they were confirmed.

Another note, seems that I may be in the minority for this opinion, but I thought the controller felt cheaply made. It doesn't feel as sturdy as the PS4 or XBone controllers. The clicking of the touchpads feels cheap. The back battery plate feels cheap. And the just the feel of it just makes me think of a generic controller.

Do you enjoy laggy servers?

Do you like the super powered puck protect?

Do you like watching the computer make 8 passes in a row for a beauty one timer?

Did you miss the never ending skating in the neutral zone from the computer that was in NHL 14?

Haven't thrown your remote against the wall lately?

If you answer YES, than come on down to NHL 16!

Just be warned, you can't play EASHL because there's too much input lag and no one can receive passes (let alone the CPU CAN'T pass).

AND....

You can't play offline because if the CPU gets into your offensive zone, they can make 1000 passes without error around the rink setting up either a one timer cross crease, or if you defend that, a slap shot deflection from the point.

I would like to receive a pass.  Am I asking too much from this game?  If they can't fix a simple thing like passing in the next tuner update, I'm selling this game.  It's getting close to where I'm writing off the EA sports NHL series.

It just made sense. Many of my friends were playing this game. This was the most hyped game in the history of PC gaming thus far. So, I gave it a try. The first time through the game was amazing. But, as you go along, there are far too many limitations and unpolished aspects of the game.

The Good

* The heroes. There are a wide variety classes - The Barbarian, Monk, Demon Hunter, Witch, and the Wizard. Lots of different characters to play with. Barbarian for the close range, physical prowess. Demon Hunter for the long range sniping and shooting ability. Witch and Wizard with spells and spiritual powers.

* Beautiful settings. Dirt, night, day, villages, fire, hell, heaven, everything looks gorgeous

* The first time through the game is epic, until the very last ACT. The ACT was just disappointing. I couldn't even believe when I killed Diablo. I figured it should have been a bit more difficult. Still, the first half and through the first part of the 2nd half is pulse pounding fun.

* Looting. It's quite fun. And addictive.

* Armor and weapons upgrading. Highly addictive to a certain extent. There are attributes that make certain armor and weapons more appealing, including vitality, regeneration, gold find, and so forth.

The Bad, Bad, Bad

* Required online log in. What? Are you kidding me? I have to log in and stay online just to play by myself. I should never have to lag when I am playing alone. A hiccup in internet connection is all it takes to die. If that happens in hardcore, oh that is no good at all.

* No voice chat function. That makes no sense at all. Valve has succeeded and made it a standard. It makes absolute no sense to force players to use the in-game text chat or other external programs like skype and ventrilo. Shame on Blizzard.

* The additional modes are not appealing. After you finish the game once, you enter Nightmare mode, and so forth. However, aside from higher difficulty, different items, and tougher monsters, there is really no difference. The same thing, again and again.

* I expected the graphics to be much better and refined. Zoomed in, the game just looks horrible and blocky.

I had a wonderful and enjoyable time finishing the game first time through. After that, I began to mope around and wander around trying to find some reason to keep playing the game. So I tried selling armor and weapon. I purchased armor and weapons from the auctions. I wanted to improve my hero's overall makeup. Then, that got old. I officially stopped playing after a month.

Well with Diablo III you don't have to worry about it the game looks exactly like Diablo 2 in fact you could probably call this Diablo 2.1. Eleven years after Diablo 2 comes out and they haven't made hardly any changes that you can you tell, I'm not sure what they were thinking. Here are my observations of the game. First the biggest thing is to play single player you have to play online through Battle Net. This has to be the dumbest idea they could have come up with.  I had problems getting my account setup since I hadn't played Battle Net in about 10 years so I didn't remember my password and the other information to reset it. It took several hours to get the download and get my account straightened out. I was fortunate and didn't have any problems getting into Battle Net once I had my account setup.  I did have problems once I got on; I got kicked out of Battle Net 3 times during the game. Once after a major Boss Fight and I lost all of the treasure, which really made me mad. There is a lot of server lag where you are in a fight and one second you are toe to toe fighting it out and the next you're on the other side of the screen, so disappointing.
  The game took me about 25 hours to complete with a level 31 Barbarian. The graphics and music are pretty much the same as Diablo 2 and you still have this far away camera angle and you can't zoom in to your character. I guess it really doesn't matter since you can't really customize your character you're stuck with one of five premade character classes all with a male or female option. You would think after 11 years you would be able to customize what your character looks like hair color and style and facial hair or not, nope they made them for you and sometime they are just ugly. You would think if you play with friends you could get confused on which is your character.
  Like I said there is nothing new in the game I did notice that they removed the matched armor sets that if you got the entire set it would give you a bonus. The game just got tedious after a while and I had to force myself to complete the game. In fact the only thing I really liked was the cut scenes the animation is just mind blowing they look so good. The game isn't bad but it's not good either and with having to play a solo game online does move it to bad game.

The Bad: Boring story, broken stealth mechanics, technical flaws

I have really given this game some time and I tried to forgive it. I rented this on Xbox 360 when it first came out and gave up after the second level. I bought this as a cheap Steam sale about a year ago and have just had it sitting on my HDD since then. I have gone back here and there to try to beat or continue this game. I just can't do it and have finally given up. After two years of giving this game a chance I doubt it will become better over time. The paper-thin story, poor stealth mechanics, and technical flaws just bring this promising game down.

You play as a British spy infiltrating Germany during World War II and other occupied territories for...I don't know really. The story is presented in flashbacks that don't really explain much other than why Violet is at that current location. You have various goals you have to complete, but there are enemies in between that you have to kill off or avoid. A stealth game has to have great stealth mechanics like sneaking, killing, and gadgets which Velvet fails in every category. First off, she moves way to slow when crouching. You can never catch up to enemies who are walking because they just leave her in the dust. This is extremely difficult when you are trying to quickly kill someone before you are spotted. The kill moves are pretty cool, but you have to be in the exact position the game needs you to be before you can trigger it. You also have to be extremely close which is ridiculous. This isn't Splinter Cell where you can trigger the kill at a reasonable distance.

You get a few items to help you kill these Nazis. You can use Morphine shots to become invisible, freeze time, and do an automatic kill. This is useful for a guard that has spotted so you can take him down really quick. You get a silenced pistol, but ammo is hard to come by so use it wisely. Some times you can also use a Nazi uniform as a disguise, but if you get too close to enemies they will recognize you. The game has shadow stealth which means if you hide in the shadows you will have a blue aura around you and enemies won't see you. This game has some of the dumbest enemy AI I have ever seen. You can whistle to lure a guard to some shadows but he won't see you even though you are two feet in front of him. If you are seen and try to hide the enemies know exactly where you are and you can't hide from them. What kind of lame crap is that?

The game looks good and has a nice visual art style, but there are some technical flaws here. Animations are pretty bad with some terrible sound effects. The footsteps all sounds the same and the animations just seems floaty and canned. I also found some of the guards patrols to be very long and the overall patterns are hard to work around. It's difficult to figure out how to take out enemies because there are no natural hints or obvious paths most of the time.

Overall, Velvet Assassin was a promising stealth action game set in World War II but has a pointless story, broken stealth mechanics, and some technical flaws. The game looks good, but other than that there is no reason for you to pick this up. Rent this if you want to play a stealth game with a sexy protagonist, otherwise look elsewhere.","Great ideas, but a poor stealth action game",1341446400,,,

2.0,False,"11 19, 2011",A1CA1A1MGW0I3J,B000GPXS9O,Raisuli the Magnificent,"I purchased this game when it first came out.  The thing was incredibly popular, and, just meeting the bare minimum requirements, my computer was able to run it after a fashion.  The number of players and servers was incredible.  Thousands of servers with hundreds of players per server, and that was just on the official EA server bank.  Private rental servers were not listed, nor LAN games.  I mean, wow, this was a real opportunity.

Unfortunately it took too long to load on my system to make it worth my while.  Well, some years later, and a major upgrade, the thing loads quick and runs super smooth, but alas there are barely fifty people playing at any one time, if that.

How could this be?  Why is this so?  Well, unlike other games in the genre, notably the Delta Force series by Novalogic, the physics for weapons' performances are ""game-ified"" for lack of a better term.  In the Delta Force series the weapons are particle based and modeled on real performances.  So when you fire your weapon a bullet is actually travelling in the game environment to a target.  There is something akin to that in BF2142, but not based on any real world nor contemporary technology, much less improved weapons' technology as one might expect from the next generation of firearms and armor.  In short, if you could import a weapon from another game into this one, you might do well.

The other nitpick is a major design flaw.  A game like counter strike focuses on a terrorist/counter-terrorist scenario, therefore the maps are confined by design to keep the players focused on the objectives.  But in BF2142, where it would make sense to outflank an opponent, there is no lateral leeway in the maps presented.  You are confined to a designated area, and if you deviate, you will be killed.  Again unlike a game like Joint Operations, where the map is essentially infinite, and you can roam and fly all over away from the action as you please.  For whatever reason, EA Games thought otherwise of their game.

The targetting for the weapons themselves is a little clumsy, and the sights on the weapons, though ""futuristic"" looking (as are some of the weapons models and skins), they do not lend themselves to seeing the ""Battlefield"" so to speak.  Therefore, when you aim that rifle or support weapon, your sights block nearly everything else from view.  Not a good situation.

The concept of a Titan, though enticing, doesn't lend itself to the game, nor do the legged armor.  And the tank weapons are as weak and poorly modeled as can be conceived.  Again, many flaws.

I tried to like the game.  I really did, but, based on my other experiences with other shooters, no matter how sexy the graphics (because they are appealing) nor the story (because it is inventive and plausible), the actual game-play, though fast and furious, lacks in the ""realism"" department.  I found myself wanting to play Jedi Knight or some older game.

That's not to say that BF2142 isn't fun, because it is, but it doesn't hold up to other offerings on the market.  Even a venerable game that's seen updates, again like Half Life, Counter Strike and Novalogic's series of shooters, leaves BF2142 behind and something less than to be desired.

The one thing that BF2142 has going for it are the sexy graphics and sound effects.  The atmosphere and setting are impressive for a combat shooter, but a lack of pliability and flexibility on the game map and flaws in the weapon design, put it under the category of ""almost brilliant"".

All in all an interesting diversion, but there are bettering offerings on the market.

*UPDATE*
I have to update my review here.  I uninstalled this game to free up some space, and after reinstalling it I had forgotten why I disliked tinkering with it in the first place.  I purchased the deluxe DVD edition of this game, thinking all the kinks had been worked out in the previous versions, but they hadn't.

I have spent the last two days trying to get this thing to work again on my computer.  Time which I should have been dedicating to other projects.  I downloaded the 1.5 patch, but it wouldn't install.  I DL'd and tried installing it a variety of times with DL's from different servers all over the world.  None worked.  I uninstalled the game, reinstalled it, patched it, screwed with the registry, but none of it worked.

I finally downloaded the final 1.4 patch, installed it succesfully (which took several tries because the previous DL's of that file were corrupt), then DL'd the 1.4 to 1.5 incremental update, but the game still wouldn't play.  I had to DL yet ANOTHER patch, the 1.50 to 1.51 patch, and then, and only then, would this thing fire up in multiplayer mode.

You know, there's a reason I don't like the Battlefield series, ditto with Call of Duty and the two other big military shooters on the market, and why I stick with my non-flashy but slightly more realistic other game.  BF2142, as far as the actual gameplay goes, is just okay, but has some very sexy looking graphics, which is what attracts people.  But to force the consumer to waste his time to download and patch up a game that should have been held back before release, is just asking way too much.

The game takes place in a BLADE-RUNNER inspired near future, which is evident by the flying cars and the dark metroplis in which it is set.  The plot revolves around a terrorist group and a corporate conglomerate trying to harness a new invention that may very well turn into global mind-control.  Your character has to figure out the truth of what is occurring and choose which side he is on.

As I said, the look of the game is straight out of the BLADE RUNNER game from a few years previous.  But the gameplay is much different - at its core, it's still an adventure game.  You collect items to be used on objects at later times, sometimes in combination with other items.

We've seen this variation more times than we can count, at this point - however, I have gotten used to the recent games and the innovations they have offered, so it was a bit of a shock to jump back 11 years to ""the way things used to be"" - by this I mean there were many unwelcome elements to the game that served to draw it out longer than it should have.  Most notably, getting from one pre-rendered area to the next often meant having to sit still and wait while my guy walks from one side of the screen to the other.

Furthermore, this being an event-triggering game means you may talk to one person, then talk to a few more and find yourself at a seeming dead end, because you don't realize that the first character you talked to NOW has something new to say or offer based on events you've triggered since talking to him.  This backtracking stretches the game out longer than it should be.

Also, in an attempt to add some depth, I guess, the game features ALOT of objects you can scan that end up being useless.  This, however, causes you to miss some things along the way.  I would search a cabinet and have the character tell me everything that was in there, and what objects he was taking.  Later, I'd search a shelf and be told ""NOTHING OF INTEREST.""  And yet sitting ON that shelf was the very object I needed, I just had to see it and click on it separately - this feels like a bit of a cheap trick!

What's even more irritating is the attitude and voice acting of the main character.  I think they were going for a film noir style, but half the time, clicking on something useless would result in him simply saying ""NAAAAAHHHH!""  At other times, though, you wouldn't even get that, but a simply shrug of the shoulders as if to say, ""what do you want me to do about it!?""  I don't know why, but I found this ""attitude"" to be supremely annoying!

The story was par for the course for an adventure game.  Predictable, entertaining enough but certainly not worthy of a film or book adaptation.

Graphically, the game was pretty good considering its age.  Once again, think BLADE RUNNER style drab and dark.  It certainly isn't pretty, by any stretch - but it has a consistent style appropriate to the story.

If you find it cheap at Half-Price Books as I did, you'll make an enjoyable weekend distraction of it - but I wouldn't go out of my way to add it to your collection.","Age hasn't been kind, but it's an ok outing for adventure fans.",1242000000,,,

Deadly Dozen Pacific Theater is VERY similar to the Vietnam game: the sounds, the scenery, the game play, even the names of your squad. That was really disappointing to me.  I was hoping for something different. Also, the AI (your squadmates) often get stuck behind fences or in buildings (even though you issue an order to follow you). When that happens, you have to switch to their character and walk them to the location of the rest of your squad. This didn't happen in the Vietnam game.

I felt that the character voices and the narration were much better in the Vietnam game; and the missions were more refined.

I played Deadly Dozen Pacific Theater for about an hour, and then I decided not to finish the game. I'd rather replay the Vietnam game.

i played the PC version of Jedi Outcast at a friend's and really wanted to pick up a copy on my way home that day - it played well and looked sweet!  that didn't happen due to work and school schedules and by the time i had any time to play a few new games, this puppy was out of the x-box = woo hoo!  i was stoked that i could play this game in the comfort of my living room using a controller that works with my larger hands. another bonus was reading several publicized reviews stating that the x-box version was every bit as good as its PC partner.... nope.
the graphics for the x-box version are kinda sad.  no, they're not Atari 2600 bad (""Go little yellow dot, go!!""), but both Lucas and Gates should be smacked silly for not utilizing the graphical prowess this machine has.  the only conclusion i can come to is laziness and the assumption that hard-core fans will buy any game with the Star Wars license (which seems to be the case if you're played many of the early SW PC games.  ech).  if you ever saw the difference between the PC and PS2 version of Max Payne then you know what to expect.  it's a shame, really.
the gameplay is not so great, either.  for a big chunk of this game, you're playing a lackluster FPS, at best.  i really wanted a fast and furious shooter that took place within the Star Wars universe.  what i got was a lame FPS with goofy ""puzzles"" that annoy more than entertain (such as: just trying to figure out where you're supposed to go, finally figuring that out, but now you can't open the door you know you have to go through, and then spending too much time backtracking to find the switch that you wizzed past that opens another door somewhere else that leads to yet another panel that allows you to finally move on.  this would be more interesting if there was action involved to break up the hunt for the hidden switch, but you killed off everyone on this part of the map within two minutes.  snooooooooze).  i really, really wish that someone in the various reviews i read had mentioned that there was a large puzzle element involved... and that they're pretty lame.  if this game had been released on N64 way before GoldenEye, it would have been pretty cool... but we're way past that, now.
((and good luck if you get stuck with a friendly character that is tagging along for that level/map.  they're really good at getting themselves shot and if you try to run ahead to protect them, you either get wasted or they run in front of you and you waste them = game over. repeat.))
making it to the point where you can use a saber is really not worth it, imho.  i only made it that far to try and justify that price of buying this game new = waste of time and a big mistake on my part.  the multiplayer is kinda fun b/c you can throw a ton of bots on the map with both weapons and sabers.  it's chaotic, but pretty much any other game with such options will blow this one away.  there are a lot of maps and game types to choose from but, again, the game doesn't look that great and you always have the feeling that you should be spending your time on something more deserving (like pulling nose hairs or waxing the carpet).
if you're a diehard fan, this game may still be worth it.  you will see familiar characters and the sounds are all the same, but you should demand better.  this is a licensing deal and not much more.  the x-box port was either rushed or no one cared - either way, we lose.  please, RENT this first if you're still curious... or, if you live in Cincinnati/N.Ky, there will be one more used copy on the market very, very soon.","not feelin your force, holmes...",1043020800,,,

I traded 1 week after that the new Mini PS2 for an old Block PS2 with a hardly very difficult problem, cause they didn't want to get it.

The Mini PS2 has a lot of problems, first the lector lens is more at the open air, you can see if when you open the top part of the PS2, while the Big Block PS2 lector lens won't be seen, unless you open it. This makes the lens more weaker and it can get dirty more easily than the big PS2 lens.

Second the power source for the Mini PS2 is attached just next to it, while you are playing over an hour long the PS2 will overheat more than normal and it can get damage for that, even the lens can get overheated. Instead the old Big PS2 had a separate power source, so that it won't overheat the PS2 nor the lens.

Thrid the new Mini PS2 is more fragile, so if you drop it, it will break even if you drop it to the ground from 1 feet above the ground it can break or get damage. Instead the old block PS2 can resist all hard handles... so you just care it and mess with it.

Loved the game, all the friends I made, the experiences were ""the good old days"". Everything after Vanilla Destiny was just meh. Every single one of my clan members except for one still plays. Rise of Iron is more recycled content, re-skinned enemies and the like. Destiny is but a husk of what it was and what it SHOULD be. I swear this game should have been epic. The honeymoon was over after year 1. People just coming to destiny will enjoy Rise of Iron because you basically get the game that should have been released in 2014. For veteran players, this DLC or expansion or whatever it is, is just simply not enough.

3 to 4 hours of story-mode then it's back to the light level grind and crucible until your hands fall off. I just don't get how games like Borderlands and Dragon Age etc etc can easily give you 40 to 60 hours of story and then multiplayer on top. Destiny gives barely any story each expansion and expects veteran players (not new people) to stick around?

Honestly if you just watch a video of a playthrough on youtube for Rise of Iron you'll save yourself $30 to $60 of gas money. I had money to burn for the $30 legacy upgrade so it's not a big deal. But if you are hurting for cash, spend wisely, Rise of Iron is way over hyped and overrated IMO.

I don't get how people are so content with Bungies constant regurgitating of content, enemies and gameplay. Rise of Iron is literally Destiny year 1 in the same area with the same enemies who are a different color. rant rant bla bla. To each their own.

Rise of Iron = 4/10. Worth a couple of hours of gameplay IF you have the money to burn. If not, save your cash for something better. Very sub par expansion.","Just not enough Bungie.

However after a few minutes of playing, you realize it still needs a lot of work, and I mean A LOT!

First off, before even putting the game in the DS, the instruction booklet is of no use to you what so ever. I want you to think for a couple of seconds about what you would expect to find in an instruction booklet... (jeopardy music).... now, you probably would have guessed INSTRUCTIONS for $500.... *buzzer* there are no instructions to be found in it!!! The first two pages are the usual warning stuff, then it shows a couple of pictures and some long rant about tag teams and what THQ planned to do with this game. It's made by THQ, why does it sound like it's a preview article from some magazine? There is nothing in it but some dumb rant for 15 pages saying this game is going to rock.... WTF?

So onto the game. First thing I went to was the create a player... and it's pretty disappointing... sure it's the first of it's kind on a DS system, but it has so very little to chose from.... 4 body types, one ripped, semi ripped, not muscly and skinny as ric flair if he had anorexia.... you will not find body types for fat or female. But you can choose whatever skin color you want, as we just can not live without making a hulk hogan mod with green skin to actually look like the hulk.

The rest of the clothing is fairly limitless, you can make a char that resembles what you want, but don't expect to find much there you think is cool, whoever thought bunny ears and a clown nose would be a great inclusion needs to be locked in a sharpshooter for a month.

Moves are pretty limitless to. You can only have 2 weak grapple, two strong grapple, same for reverse positions, a ground hit, a ground move blah blah blah.... thats not enough... I was SO bored stupid trying to go through season mode with an array of 10 moves to repeat over and over and over again, you find yourself constantly quitting season mode to change your custom wrestlers moves to keep some sort of interest going in the game. (doing that won't effect your season)

Also, the limited selection of moves... unlike the other THQ create a wrassler modes, this one doesnt have a selection for weak and strong grapples, it has one lot to select for either, so you could have a weak grapple tombstone piledriver and a strong grapple arm lock... but whats even dumber, the moves you can select are only of that who is in this game. there is 21 wrestlers in this game or something like that, meaning there is only 21 finishers you can select from.... don't look for a Stunner, Rock Bottom, Mandible Claw, Atomic Leg Drop, Figure 4 Leg Lock... there not in this game!
Music and entrance is the same, but they did add 1, and i repeat 1 song that is custom, and it's not worth using.

So... onto game play now.
The graphics are much the same as 08, only the entrances are now included and look pretty good for a DS game. And there is pretty much every arena to choose from (ppv's ect) and each look ok... but you pretty much only see them during the entrance, as every match is an angle in the ring where you can see the ramp but thats it.... and don't look for backstage areas, you can't get to them during matches... what you see in previews is one of 4 areas you visit.... which is annoying, i'll tell you why.... in 08 you went from area to area to either look for an opponent, an office, look for items or to train.... it's not that much of an improvement here.... you start in your house, where you live i guess, and in the room you have a bed, which you have to go to sleep to get to next week, a computer to either save your game or shop for useless items.... a coffee table with magazines to check your progress, who is champ and who you have beaten as well as a checklist of opponents you took on, and your records of win and loss... there is also a cubboard to select items that might give you a bit of a boost in your stats which is a waste of time as you can have all the stats as high as you want, the only one decent to have is submissions so it doesnt take as long to make an opponent tap out.

Then there is wwe headquarters, you go there to talk to vince, or one of the GM's when they call you. Then there is the gym to work out in 3 ways, work on your head using a stupid mini game to lift dumbbells by following a curser on the screen with your stylus stick.... a weight lifting game where you blow into the mic ... and yes, it blows... and another where you have to keep lifting little falling bars back to the top of a box to do the last one.... annoying because you can only do one training thing per week, if you could do it constantly one after the other it might have been ok, but it's annoying having to play home>>gym>>match every time you play... win your match and then your home again to repeat it over and over and over and over and over again.

The matches themselves are a different play then 08, but it still needs so much more work. Using the direction pad and the stylus at the same time just feels awkward. You can get used to it, but why the heck did they bother to incorporate the stylus? It would be so much easier to just use the buttons like the other console versions.

It's also annoying that half the time you get out done by the computer if you try to beat them by doing grapple moves, as the computer usually comes out on top if you screw up or are not fast enough drawing annoying circles on the screen.

And it has those cheap strategies you revert to... like knocking them down and using submissions till you win, or what i find myself doing a lot is going outside the ring, knock your opponent down at the 7 count and get back in the ring for them to be counted out, works 95% of the time... and is cheap but too effective.

So it may not be the same game play and style as the 08 version, but it still is very limited and needs so much, so much, SO MUCH work done to improve this game for DS.

Season mode is boring, too. I already said what I said about the repetitiveness of the game, but the awards and achievements in the game give you no satisfaction at all. A still shot of some diva bimbo smiling and a message saying, ""wwe champion"" is a kick in the teeth to anyone expecting something just a little bit better then a still image... it's like a prettied up version of a NES game that said, ""congratulations, thanks for playing, hope you enjoyed working your tush off for days in order to read this message""

I have not had this game a week yet, and already I have lost the urge to play it again. I just don't care to complete season mode to find out what happens in the end... even if I can find codes that work for it, or action replay cheats... I still don't think anything could make this game any better to me.

I'm not so disappointed int he price of the game, as I got mine for a bargain on ebay, but I would say that if you pay more then 10 for this, your being ripped off.

There are a lot of people out there still waiting to know how this game plays before trying it... all I can say is, don't kick yourself if you have to wait 10 years to find one for 50 cents at a pawn shop, you will not have missed out on a game you must try before you die. It may have a so called ""improved"" style of playing, but it's far from fun.

The in game sound of the crowed is barley there, they only make a sound when you are ready to do a finisher, they don't chant, the game play is stale, the controls are annoying, there is no charisma or fun to the game play, and is in bad need of commentary as the matches get more boring then the last watching to decent looking chars play like absolute stiff drones.","improvment, but still no where near perfection",1228348800,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo DS'}",

First, the missions are limited and very linear. Go hear, do this then do that. finished.

Secondly, its a grind game. You are always doing the same thing over and over just to get something.

Third, there is no real story. Somehow the story of destiny got destroyed before it came out. What you get are bits and pieces of a story that seem more haphazard than anything. Even after reading all the grimore cards you walk away saying WTF? Here's the story in a nutshell. The traveler is a big ball that comes to earth, theres a war with other races and nobody wins. Thats it! no explanations as to why or how for anything.

Fourth, weapons and vehicles. There is only one vehicle its like a speeder bike and it gets you from point A to point B. It doesn't have a weapon.
The weapons are handed out randomly and very erratic. You don't get rewarded for being a good player, in fact good players will get less rewards than bad players. The weapons themselves are pretty much all the same except for a couple of exotic weapons. Some shoot a little better than others but in the end their pretty much all just basic weapons. nothing really fancy or really futuristic.

Fifth, online gameplay sucks. The online play is horrible because of lag and the rewards. Lag is one of the worst I have ever seen. Rewards are once again given to the worst players, not the best players.

Conclusion- Destiny is an OK game but nothing like it was advertised as or what it has become. The developers seem to bring the game down to the level of the lowest ranking players, meaning that a 4 year old has a better chance of advancement and better weapons , than an advanced player does. You are not rewarded properly for being a good player. The game itself is addictive because it hands out rewards in a supposedly lottery type fashion, So if you don't get something now, come back later and try again and again and again and again.

At first, I thought this game was great. After playing it almost every day for about 5 weeks, I have a very different view.

Pros-

Most of the games are actually fun at first. You'll probably learn some words and their spelling. Easy to pick up.

Now for the much longer list of cons-

This game does a terrible job of gauging your current level. It asks you far too few words, almost all of which are highly advanced, and placed both my friend and I FAR lower than it should have. There's nothing you can do about that. I'm 24 years old, and after 5 weeks of updating my expression potential to 34%, I'm still seeing words like kettle, jaguar, squirt, traumatic, solitary, airfield, canine, rephrase, acoustic, receptive, sparrow, nutrition, slang, stumbling, optimism, and so forth. I would say 80% of the words I've seen on here are elementary school level, while the other 20% are middle-school level. I have not ""learned"" a single word that I would consider calling high-school level.

You'll learn very little for the time you spend playing. Of the few words that were new to me, hardly any of them were repeated more than a few times, often in the same day. You are bombarded with far too many words over time, when it should just be reinforcing groups of words before moving on to more. Also, the only time you actually learn anything is when you read through the definitions after each game. There's nothing at all to be learned by playing the games. It teaches you like a dictionary does. But the worst part is that there is no context or pronunciation! After playing for long enough, you will eventually unlock a game that doesn't count toward your EP, but does have recordings of the words being spoken as well as context examples. However, you can only access these one random word at a time. You are given very little time to read the examples. This means that pronunciation and context are on the game, but you can't look them up or access them at all while supposedly updating your potential to express yourself with words you don't necessarily understand.

The definitions are often VERY weak. The part of speech (verb, noun...) is not given at all. If a definition is too long then it simply cuts off rather than allowing you to scroll down to read the whole thing. Many words appear in their own definition, which is never acceptable. Words with multiple definitions will only have one of them provided. Some definitions couldn't possibly be more wrong: inflammable is defined as, ""Things that burn very easily."" First of all, inflammable is an adjective and the definition is given for a plural noun. Also, while it is technically true, it has been a VERY long time since vernacular changed to avoid confusion, and even my dictionary suggests that you not use the word like this.

The simple little games become mundane very quickly. You would have to play this game for several months to really get that much out of it, but it will get very boring long before that. Most of what your coach says to you is hardly better than mindless dribble. The graphics are quite simple and the music is extremely limited and dull. One day it randomly told me that the word of the week is minstrel. Apparently the word of the week means a word you won't be learning, because it never gave me the definition or even put it in any of the games.  It's not that uncommon for it to tell me that my EP has been updated when in fact it is exactly the same.

Ultimately, the developers were too lazy to provide the necessary elements for learning a new word, make it accurately gauge your personal level, come up with enough games to keep it interesting for a long time; they didn't even make sure they got the definitions right! They started with a great idea, and released a product that falls unforgivably short of its potential.",Not for people who are serious about actually learning the words,1200614400,49,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo DS'},

I'd just bought a mechanical key board but it seemed to lag when playing games leading to slow response in fight/flight situations. Well, this fixed that. The cherry red keys are MUCH more quiet and work smoothly. When not playing games I prefer my other keyboard for the click and feel, but with games not so much. Now what I don't like. First, it is a decent keyboard. The problem is value. I paid seventy US for it and it just isn't worth nearly that much imho. It comes with two sets of replacement key caps: one WASD with one texture on them (and grey instead of the keyboard's black) and another set of 6 keys which I forget (except for the R which I'm using) with a *slightly* different texture (this is subjective and based on the sensitivity of my old finger tips, ymmv). The replacement keys are also slanted, I suppose theoretically they are more ergonomic when playing a game (with your left hand hovering over that part of the keyboard). I like the different color, the different texture, and the slant. To be honest, I find the slant tells my finger tips more than the texture does. You can program the back lighting (or should I call it through lighting since it glows thru the keys (as well as around them slightly). That's cool to look at. For about 30 seconds then, not so much. I buy lit keyboards to help me SEE the keys, not to look cool and the special effects (pulsing, trails, rain, etc.) don't help much. I've turned it off and have the lighting at a constant medium level. The brightest setting is too bright for me, the dimmest too dim, so I'd say they got that right (although I would have preferred a few more increments in between lowest and highest intensity). I really miss the hand rest, I think for the price, it should have come with one. (My other keyboard (iirc) didn't have one either but I don't miss it there. Maybe because unlike the Strafe, the other has two legs so you can raise (slant) the top of the keyboard. The Strafe has no such option. (Although I suppose I could shim it with something and get the same effect.) I really don't like the shift key symbols (on the number keys: ~!@#$%^&*()_+) NOT being lit hardly at all. When I'm hunting for the $ sign, I have to look, and the fact that the symbol is barely illuminated knocks this down an entire star. No programming of keys (except for lighting patterns. (One sorta programming thing is that pressing a key can cause that key to light up and gradually fade, but other than lighting effects, nada.) I find myself constantly being in Caps Lock mode and while the light stripe at the top right of the keyboard clearly indicates it, I really don't like that kind of surprise while in some tight corner in a game. As far as macros and changing default key assignments, look elsewhere, this doesn't have it. As far as lighting colors other than red - ditto. It solved the lag problem I was seeing (I wonder if the lack of programming (or reprogramming) of keys makes it faster? IDK). It allows slightly better finger centering (what do you call knowing where your fingers are on the keyboard? kinesthesia? yeah, that's improved a bit, but not as much as I'd hoped. To sum up: adequate for the intended purpose, but WAY overpriced (on sale for seventy). Do people really game with the keyboard lighting up in patterns? Wow, I'd be distracted.

2.0,False,"02 15, 2010",A3RWG8GN7XHBKL,B00166N6SA,Katie,"I wrote a review for the Sims 2. I can largely copy and paste it because the progression from Sims 2 to Sim 3 is the same as The Sims 1 to Sims 2.

This new version has much better graphics, more realistic movement, and better social options. The Sims 3 has refined the idea of having goals and a purpose to the game a bit more. However, the problem persists in that there's little pay off. You are doing all the same sorts of boring things you've always done. The goals just makes you choose one boring thing over another.

See, the problem with this game is something they did wrong from the get-go in the Sims 1 and Sims 2 and still haven't fixed: Making people eat food and go to the bathroom is boring. Think about life -- real life, your life. What makes it interesting? What resonates? Not taking a shower. It really is our emotional connections and social interactions. But this game addresses it in such an unfulfilling way.

This game misses out on the driving force behind anything we do in real life. Cause, followed by effect. The behavior of the Sims doesn't match the way real people act. For example, you can have a Sim eat too much food and get fat. Once they are fat, they will walk a little slower than they did before. They won't get depressed or need new clothes. They just walk slower. So what? There is absolutely no reason to make your Sim eat too much food in the first place. There should be a benefit of it for the Sim that would make him want to overeat. Maybe it could increase their mood or maybe it could increase their comfort level or maybe their mood or comfort would suffer if they didn't overeat.

This game acts like the only thing that affects our behavior are plainly and simply our physical needs. The game completely misses the psychology and emotions of humans that make us more interesting than animals. We might as well be controlling a pack of bears and having them pick berries and mate and eat and poo. Because that's this game is: mundane micromanaging.

The first time around playing, exploring all the different social options and possibilities is interesting, and it can be fun to take the mechanical boring action on the screen and create your own storyline to it.

This amounts to endless ten-second sprints followed by instant restarts, as you invariably struggle to flawlessly execute every twist & turn as required by the game.  It should be telling that there are three controls used almost equally throughout the game - steering, accelerator, and restart level.

It would be a lot more palatable if so many of the tracks didn't require greater steering precision than the standard Xbox One Wireless controllers provide.  There are many times where you have to steer very precisely through narrow openings, requiring very tiny adjustments to course.  That's not easy, however, because the joysticks on the Xbox One Wireless controllers (as with all such controllers I've ever used) have a little bit of slack around their neutral positions, during which they won't actually register an input.  The minimum deflection they actually register results in too much steering, in many cases.  This leads to 'digital' steering where you repeatedly give little love-taps to the joysticks to try to approximate the small adjustment you want.

The wheel has accurate steering on the GTR Evolution game I purchased from Amazon (recommended). After logging in around 30 hours of racing, the up shifter broke. I have now switched the up gear shifting to a button, which is a little awkward to reach while trying to shift quickly. The wheel was not compatible with Need for Speed: Shift that I also ordered.  Even after adjusting the steering sensitivity to 100%, the best the Shift game would do was to have the car zig/zag slowly on the track--get GTR Evolution. I tried to treat the wheel gently, within reason, and the shifter still broke. Thrustmaster says it has a two year warranty. I haven't sent it back yet to check out the coverage.

I guess the launch titles were so few for both systems dash to the market that they had to throw a turd like this in the mix just to make sure they would have one corn-fed cash cow. For a PS3 or Xbox 360 game, this is pretty standard issue and would get 3 stars. It's nothing new, exciting, or engrossing, but it's that rebounder you can always go back to if you need someone to cuddle one night and forget the next day.

I will say that the game looks great and plays smoothly, but that should be a given for a game with this budget. What I am not seeing is progression.

When it comes to shooting games, I like something more like Halo, where I can be stuck with some weapons and feel the need to desperately scramble to get another. In this game, I never feel that urgency. Any rifle, pistol, yawn gun, bore pole, or turd grenade will help me paint the town red (especially in the campaign). And what a boring town to paint. If they weren't going to change their formula for combat, I was hoping that at least the environment would be more fun to walk around in, but I think the levels in Golden Eye were more interactive than these. If a bird is in the sky and I want to shoot it, I should be able to and I should be able to find the body. If there is a piano in a room, I think that such an odd inclusion must serve a function, but when I shoot it or drop a grenade in it, nothing happens. Same deal if I shoot a rocket launcher at a wall or a chair...or a painting. I am looking for those details in a next gen console and if what I am going to get is a recycled shooter like this, then we have to ask what the hell are we doing here, why are people waiting in line for hours to get one of these systems, and how can I get my $500 back (or at least the $60 I paid for this game)? Thank God a next-gen version of this game is not more expensive than the other consoles or I would be hulk smashing Activision's office right about now.

I know a lot of people rag on campaigns and would like to see their disappearance, but I always play through the campaigns. So much money goes into them that I might as well.

Anyway, I picked it up after reading several things on it. And I must say, I was really disappointed in what the game had. In my opinion, it shouldn't qualify as a Sonic game. The two player mode is really lacking something. The music doesn't even compare to the awesome compositions in Sonic 1 and 2. Yes, I know they included a few songs and stuff from the first game, but that's about it.
The first thing I noticed was the character choices. If you play Sonic 2 or 3, you have a choice of playing as Sonic, Tails, or both. This game didn't have that, and that was a sorry thing to see. Amy Rose is one of my favorite characters, but I really think that the game wouldn't lack anything if she wasn't a character in the game. The levels and their titles weren't all that spectacular. Sure, they had a lot more boxes than the first games, and what really made me mad was the invincibility. I know they kept the same music, but the invincibility that's a Sonic trademark is the sparkles that surround the character. This game takes it from Sonic Adventure 2, and that made me upset, because it's just not...Sonic. The moves were hard to get used to, and (I'm sorry that I'm going too in-depth with this stuff, but....) all of the characters shouldn't have attacks, like in Sonic Adventure. Another thing that really disappointed me was that the levels were just too easy. There didn't seem to be enough badniks and there weren't enough turns and cool stuff like that.
I think that people who aren't die-hard Sonic fans would like this game, and it's pretty simple. But I warn those who love Sonic like I do-this game is not like traditional Sonic.

You can only choose between stereo and mono, but at least the sound effects are acceptable. Nothing exceptional, but passable.
Sound: 6.0/10

Ratchet & Clank has generally had relatively quirky music, some more dramatic pieces in Going Commando. While nothing's specifically bad here, it's also forgettable at best.
Music: 5.0/10

Action, adventure, and platforming has always been what Ratchet & Clank is all about. This is good enough for a fix, but it's nothing specifically good. Completionists will be especially frustrated, because there are a wealth of bugs, clip errors, and registry failures and there were absolutely no fixes in porting it from PSP to PS2. One of the things that Insomniac always seemed to hit squarely was the margin for error that made it challenging but not frustrating, and High Impact Games dropped the ball there.
Gameplay: 4.5/10

I only score this aspect this highly because it has the same 'Challenge Mode' that all Ratchet & Clank games had (except Quest for Booty). You keep items and experience from one play to another, but the game gets no easier or more enjoyable for it.
Replayability: 6.0/10

I wanted to like this game, and hoped that the fact that it was ported meant that it showed enough promise to be given some extra polish and another chance. It was never given any attention beyond making it run on the larger console. The lack of smooth play or forgiving margin makes it more frustrating than fun, and I'd have to recommend the rest of the series and other adventure/platformers before this.

There is an interesting Premise, which is not the same as a story. The ""story"" is (and I am dead serious) ""there are the monsters. Go get em!"" I am 15 hours into the game and the story hasn't progressed at all.

The other half of this game (in school) is good, but the characters are all weaker/less interesting than P4. Some times that's charming, sometimes it is cliche. There is zero build up to meeting your  ""friends"". In P4, you see Yosuke three times before you ever talk to him and thus you generate an opinion of him before you decide if you like him or not. In this game, they just throw Junpei at you.

And saying ""it gets better after 20 hours of gameplay"" is NOT a point in this game's favor. It's admitting to a major flaw.

2.0,False,"07 11, 2014",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B00I9UVY30,Raul G.,"I own every EA FIFA World Cup title since World Cup '98 and have looked forward to the EA Games quadrennial release ever since. I purchased 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil right in the middle of the actual World Cup and unfortunately so far I am severely disappointed with the product EA has released.

--------------------
GAMEPLAY & GRAPHICS:

Before I get into that though, you should know a few more things about this game. If you've played FIFA 2014 then you'll likely be very familiar with 2014 World Cup. This game borrows all major gameplay elements directly from FIFA 2014. Personally I really enjoyed FIFA 2014 though based on many reviews I've read that titles reception was quite mixed.

The major element of change for 2014 World Cup is of course the venue and the emphasis on national teams over club teams. EA has always done a good job with capturing the spirit of the world cup and the spectacle that surrounds each game. That remains intact in 2014 FIFA World Cup. Each game features a full introduction as you'd expect in a real World Cup game - including the players marching out onto the field, the playing of national anthems, etc. Big games (and the final) feature team and player celebrations, fireworks, confetti and all the celebratory aspects surrounding the biggest spectacle in sports. All is well in this regard of the game.

Many reviews have commented on how much more difficult 2014 World Cup is than the standard FIFA 2014 game. I think that there is definitely a higher degree of difficulty but it's not too bad. I play both games on the ""Professional"" setting and I've been able to adapt quite well to 2014 World Cup's extra bit of difficulty. I've written off the spike in difficulty as just a matter of course - you are after all supposed to be playing at the highest level soccer has to offer.

Graphics are a considerable improvement over the last World Cup game (2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa) and again are taken almost directly from FIFA 2014. That's not a bad thing at all as the graphics are actually quite nice. Player models move quite well and look very close to their real-world counterparts. The extra sheen of celebration and the bright colors of the Brazilian theme add a welcome addition to FIFA 2014's somewhat toned-down look.

--------------------
THE PROBLEMS:

My main issue with this game are the myriad of problems that it shipped with and to this day haven't been addressed. EA has taken a lot of flak from gamers and to be honest it's easy to see why.

The first problem I noticed shortly after starting my first World Cup (at the group stage). I was prompted by the game to make my 23-man roster and noticed some strange problems. The first issue is that some players aren't selectable. Meaning that you can't rotate them out of your team for another player in the reserves. This is apparently totally random as I've tried many different times with different teams using a different save file. That really won't matter though because even the players who you can rotate will ultimately be changed by the game after making your selections. For example after swapping in a few key players in my Spanish team I saved and moved onto my first match against the Netherlands and immediately noticed huge gaps in my team. No Iniesta, Villa, Silva (even though they were clearly listed in my 23-man roster) and in their place were players that I didn't call up. Again, I've tested and confirmed this exact issue with different teams using different save files.

More problems are located with the online element. Connecting is the biggest hurdle as EAs servers seem to be frequently offline. When you do get on matches are pretty inconsistent. Some matches seem to go well while others are a lagging mess or worse simply disconnect.

After buying the game I jumped on EA's forum to see if there was a fix or if I was doing anything wrong and stumbled onto a forum full of people having the exact same issues. These issues have been reported since the launch of the title and are still not fixed (going on 3 full months) with the end of the World Cup looming in a few days as writing this review.

--------------------
CONCLUSION:

EA does it again! They ship a game to meet a deadline instead of shipping a quality product. The game is broken and major elements are totally unusable. This company deserves the hate it gets. Do yourself a favor and confirm that these issues are fixed prior to buying this game or skip it altogether.

The guns are fun, but the graphics are dull, castle corridors, offices, caves...nothing memorable.

The levels feel dead, empty hallways that suddenly swarm with enemies when the dreaded alarm goes off.

There are forced stealth sections. There is insta-death platforming. There are so many armor/health/ammo pickups that half the game you're running around looking at the floor for more helmets to wear.

When I first started this game, I loved it. The tutorial level makes you think that the gameplay might require zig-zagging and limited movement, but it is actually pretty free roam. The story is based on a girl named Puperu who is both average and completely without a personality other than the standard Genki ""I can do anything!"" one that tends to be standard to many anime and games. She isn't endearing and can actually be kind of rude. In the beginning, she accidently qualifies to be the only one in her class to venture into a legendary tower to bring back a legendary crystal. She accomplishes this not by studying, but by randomly guessing the answers on her quiz. This tower is the tutorial, and instead of a crystal, she finds an adorable little creature who ate said crystal and legendary curry recipe book. This makes her teacher believe she is lying and suspend her from graduation. Thus starts the real story.
Her favorite curry restaurant is in danger of closing after a super villain opens a giant curry chain restaurant in the same town, and vows to run it out of business. Enter Puperu with her new book, who herself vows to gather the ingredients and help. To do this, she has to go to new areas full of roaming monsters, defeat them, defeat the boss holding the ingredient, and bring it back.
Add adorable little extra elements like a theater where you can se extra little stories about the monsters if you happen to find secret items laying around, and you have a unique, intriguing, and adorable game.
One of the harder catches is that your new mascot Ku eats constantly and needs to be fed or his energy goes down. When it hits zero he falls asleep and cannot help you fight. Since you can be easily overwhelmed with enemies, you need him. You also cannot move on to the next floor without reviving him. You can pick up weapons/shields to evolve, curry ingredients to cook curry power-ups, scrolls to level up those weapons/shields or to use alone, and potions...or you can feed any of it to Ku.
Except...if you die in a dungeon, you don't just lose all the items and money you picked up and brought in, you lose EVERYTHING. You lose the sword/wand and shield that you spent time, money, and effort leveling up to be stronger and have to start again.
You also start over at Level One. In a typical JRPG, you grind by defeating enemies over and over to gain levels and become stronger. This is how you defeat difficult bosses. BUT. In this game, if you die after you have spent an hour leveling up yourself (and Ku) to Level 25...you restart at Level One. Every. Time. It defeats the entire point of leveling up.
 Not a problem you say! I will just reload the game if I die and try again! No. You can't. The instant you die, the game auto-saves and even if you turn the system off (Pokemon!) the game remembers that you died, and you find yourself in town with no items, no weapons, and at Level 1. Which make it very hard to go back into your third dungeon and defeat the harder monsters. You have to go back into the easy ones and level up, then start the harder ones over.
Prior this point, I had been willing to give this game 4 stars. Now, I find myself wondering how I will finish it. When you can't rely on leveling up to defeat harder bosses or levels without losing literally hours of work in a few seconds...Imagine you are very careful. You buy 100 potions and escape options. You spend 2 hours leveling up, and head into the next dungeon. Suddenly you are overwhelmed by 15 enemies at once (it happens because each time you start a floor it changes in the way enemies wander,where you start, where the exit is) and die. Or you defeat them and make it to the boss. Who is stronger than you thought. All that effort and hard work. Gone.
SO while I wanted to love this game, to finish this game, those two HUGE flaws make it impossible. I could deal with losing all items if I could keep my weapons and my Level. I could even get around that it if you could reload if you die.

NOTE: CONTAINS WEAPON SPOILERS

Pros

-Epic battles, especially the Civil War era battles. My favorite part had you walking in line towards the enemy and firing at the enemy line. So, so epic. Reminds of Empire Total War in FPS.

-Using future weapons to kill enemy troops using muskets. Yeah, pretty rigged xD

-Part with a portable artillery rocket launcher. Didn't come with instructions and let me thinking I was being shelled on by the enemy when it was my own rockets. Once I figured it out, it was a blast to use.

-Shooting Germans with the maxim gun as they pour out of the woods. Epic.

-Frickin' shooting a wall of Roman LEGIONAIRES with SWORDS and SHIELDS with an automatic shotgun. Doesn't get more hilarious than that.

Cons

-Biggest gripe ever: crappy A.I. I cannot stress this enough. Once I accidentally slipped into a trench and was faced with like 9 soldiers just sitting there staring into space like they were mentally retarded or something. Meleed them all down and had zero resistance. WTF?? I don't recall the union sending idiots to battle.

-Repetitive at parts. Mainly the parts where you just walk to x location and shoot y amounts of people to win.

-Bad death animations. One part you fire a cannon at massed infantry. It looks like they just decided to lie down and take a break instead of dying.

-Future battles were EXTREMELY boring. Way too hauntingly similar to CoD except with dumbed down combat mechanics. Pretty much just plot filler than something of interest.

Re reviews below:  Ray is not an ""idiot"" L.L., he just expected his game to run since Kotor I ran okay on his system, and the engine is basically the same.  I've had the opportunity to play Kotor II on the Xbox (friend's copy and console), and now I've just finished the PC version (hoping Obsidian/Lucas had learned something in the last two months).  No such luck.  The game is inexcusably buggy (even after all the feedback from the Xbox version players).  This is a serious and distracting problem throughout the game (and Lucas/Obsidian tech support is not good) -- beware!

To be fair, I should note that Kotor II is a darker, more complex, more philosophical story than Kotor I.  The GAMEPLAY is somewhat better with a whole new system to build a great Jedi character (Dark or Light) and to handle combat more effectively (new Dark/Light Force powers are available along with new moves, feats and Jedi or Sith ""prestige classes"").  But the STORY, as realized, is often tedious, confusing and even puzzling (read boring) -- it often simply doesn't make sense (Like why am I doing this?).  Quests end for no apparent reason without resolution or explanation.  The ending sequences are especially bad.  Storylines begin involving NPC's in your party who you  care about, but you have no idea how they're resolved. The ending just creeps up, and then it's suddently game over (credits roll). It's almost as if they didn't get a chance to finish the last 25% of the game completely (time constraints?). This looks like a rush job for the Christmas 2004 (Xbox) shopping season which is really a shame.  With a little more development time, testing and polish, this game could have really been great.  I guess it's all about money.

 The new characters/party members are okay, but not quite as interesting as Kotor 1.  You do have a ""bond"" with one of the NPC's, but she's not a pretty young Jedi -- just the opposite in fact.  For those of you who enjoyed the ""romance"" and other sidequests involving party members in Kotor 1, there will be major disappointment. If you liked the random dialog (sometimes very funny) between certain NPC's in the first Kotor, forget it.  Most of the dialog in Kotor 2 seems to be pretty much scripted.  The new ""influence"" system is a nice touch if you like to talk a lot (and know how to say the right things).  If you handle things exactly right, you can even make apprentices (Jedi or Sith) out of certain party members.

 In a couple places the game forces you to split up your party and use party members you don't like, don't want and didn't equip (this really bothered me).  If you like combat, you can build a real ""tank"" type Jedi and mow down scores of ""enemies"" (this can get a little old after a while).  I often felt my character was actually too powerful -- even with the game setting on ""difficult"".  Remember, this time your character starts the game as a Jedi exile with some Force powers (but no light saber -- you must acquire the components and construct it).  The weapons balance (melee vs. ranged) is MUCH improved as is the ability to switch weapon types during combat.

 So, as I said in my Xbox review, this is a half great game.  The gameplay is great, but the story/quests/characters are not so great.  There's no way this game deserves 5 stars (except to real Star Wars fans who admit the game has problems but still give it 5 stars. Hmmm).  For more objective people, I'd give it 3-1/2 stars if I could.  It's a pretty good game.  Perhaps upcoming patches will fix the bugs; perhaps not.

Campaign:
I thought this was done very well. I found the story engaging and deep. I'm looking forward to Halo 5.

Spartan Ops:
No complaints, a fun continuation of the story

Multplayer:
This is where it falls short. It does not feel like Halo. There's too much of a Call of Duty influence. Mainly this comes from the choosing loadouts. What I loved about Halo was that everybody had the same weapons. If you wanted a different gun, you had to fight for it, and then fight to keep it. There was more thought and skill involved, unlike CoD where whoever has the best gun wins. Halo 4 fell into this trap, certain weapons are overpowered (lightrifle to name one) and result in irritation. Halo is supposed to be fun even if you are losing horribly. It seems to take itself too seriously. The only gametypes I like, really, are Big Team Slayer, and Pro Slayer, they feel more like Halo. Also, there is a peculiar lack of playlists including very popular ones, such as SWAT and a general Team Objective playlist. Also, the armor is not great. It mostly looks like a really bad Japanese cartoon. There are a few nice pieces, but what wrong with what was in Halo 3 and Reach? Also, joining mid-game and instant respawns do not do anyone any favors. I hope 343 removes these features via some type of patch.

Forge:
Seriously? No EMPTY maps and no flying UNSC vehicle?
There are 3 forging maps, but all of them have things that can't be removed and are not natural. And come on! No Hornet? No Falcon? No Pelican? Who came up with that?

In General:
The graphics are great, but almost too detailed, if that makes any sense. Halo 3 had a great balance: they were clear and detailed, but not so much that you got hung up on a particularly nice-looking weld. Also, the sound is quite good, but I dislike a few things. First the gun noises. The assault rifle and battle rifle are kind of off-sounding and they murdered the sniper rifle, it sounds awful and weak. I like the soundtrack for the most part, but I wish they had gotten Martin O'Donnell to do it. Also, I feel a little disconnected from the game. 343 Industries does not seem to be as tied-in to the community as Bungie was(and still is) and they don't really seem to be listening to the players.

All in all this is a very good game, and I am happy with it and will be playing it for a long time, but I wish Bungie was still in charge.

UPDATE:
Let's put it this way, I went from 4 to 3 stars.
After having played more, I find myself becoming increasingly dissatisfied with multiplayer. I hate the instant respawn, I hate the killcam (THIS IS NOT CALL OF DUTY! IT'S HALO!), and I hate that there are only 5 maps per playlist, it's so boring playing the same 5 maps over and over and over again. And it just feels so serious. Halo is supposed to be lighthearted in the multiplayer. This is something you play with your friends in real life. And they show you your #of deaths in the first post-mission report screen. In past titles, the just showed kills and assists, you had to dig a bit deeper for deaths. And the end match screen is just too much. Before it was a simple ""Your team won/lost"" in the kill feed and a faded HUD. I liked that. And back to the maps, there is only 1 great map in the game and that is the Valhalla remake. The only reason it's good is because it was lifted straight from Halo 3, where it was awesome. I like playing Big Team on Valhalla, but that gets boring after awhile.
When I first saw that there were Call of Duty developers on the Halo 4 team, I knew there were going to be issues and I was right. Halo has become WAY too much like CoD. I like CoD, but I love Halo and I want a major separation between the two.

I'm sorry, I've loved Halo in the past, but I think I going to go back to Reach. It's just better in every way.
I'm taking this game to a meet with a few friends tomorrow, and I don't think that they will like it. We usually play Reach and have a ton of fun, I don't think that this game is conducive to screwing around in splitscreen.
I'll write more once I get back.

It looks very similar to the official Nintendo brand controller, the only difference being that mine has colored face buttons(red,blue,green and yellow), says ""superpad controller"" at the top and the start and select buttons are a little higher. There is also 2 big bulky circles on the back underneath the directional pad and the face buttons, and it says ""interact"" below the start and select buttons. There are no signs of this controller being cheaply made at all, and it seems to be about identical in quality to the official Nintendo brand inside and out. However, read on...

Now, for all the 6 or 7 years I've had this controller I never had a problem, but now it's got some major issues! You may be thinking ""Jeez, 6 or 7 years with no problem is pretty good!"" but considering that the official controllers last forever, that's really not that great. I suppose it makes it far superior to many other 3rd party controllers out there, but it's still not worth it if you can find an official one. Anyway, my controller now has buttons getting set off without them even being pressed! It seems to depend on the game which buttons get set off without being pressed, but needless to say my superpad is pretty much worthless now.

Overall, you could probably do much worse, but the Nintendo brand is proven to last, and if you can find one of those that's definitely the way to go. I'm sure that everyone is going to have a different experience with their superpad - you could end up with one that lasts longer, not as long or one that has problems from the start.

The Bad: Repetition throughout, Garcia is a hard character to like, story is simple and straightforward, no reason to really go back

During the first 10 minutes of the game the first thing you will think is ""WTF?"" There's nothing else to describe this game full of childish mature humor and sick twisted ideas. That's not to say that it is bad. Most of the humor in the game is actually so childish and gross that you can't help yourself and laugh. Some stuff is downright hilarious such as Johnson's Boner gun. Before I get into any detail, I have to say the story is pretty entertaining if straight forward and simple. You play as Garcia Hotspur who is a Mexican demon hunter and has a demon accompanying him in form of a floating skull named Johnson. I didn't really care much for Garcia because he is a typical potty mouthed action hero, but I found Johnson to be the steal of the show. He's a posh British demon that uses clean cuss words and is a stark contrast to Garcia which makes him more likable and hilarious to listen to. Garcia is trying to get his stolen girlfriend, Paula, back from the demon lord Fleming, and of course you follow him into the depths of Hell.

That's about as far as the story goes. There's a small twist at the very end after the credits, but after you see it you won't be surprised it happened. The main attraction is the banter between Garcia and Johnson and the stories you read throughout the game. Some of these made me bust up because they were so funny. Other than the story I have to say that I really love the guns in this game. The creators force you to use all three, but they are upgraded so much that they feel like whole new guns throughout the game. Boner is your pistol, Teether is your machine gun, and the Skullblaster is your shotgun. These can get upgraded by finding blue gems from bosses. Boner turns into Hot Boner that can set explosive mines, Teether can get a homing upgrade, and Skullblaster will eventually get an upgrade to create giant bombs. You can find red gems throughout to upgrade your weapons and health. Gracia guzzles down alcohol to heal himself because apparently alcohol keeps you alive in Hell.

The game works around a light vs dark gameplay idea and it works well. When you are surrounded in darkness your health depletes and you need to shoot a goat candelabra to return the light. Yeah, it's weird and that's only the beginning. Gate keys consist of shoving strawberries, eyes, and brains into creepy baby faces that are guarding the gate. One level even has you walking over a giant naked Paula. The game never stops delivering weirdness, and that's exactly what makes this game so fun, because hey, it's a Suda 51 game, what do you expect?

There are a few puzzles thrown in that can be fun because they are straight forward. I didn't even need a walkthrough to get through this game. Even the boss fights use light and darkness to be beaten. In darkness you can only see the weak spot on enemies so you have to quickly shoot it because you die. This sounds frustrating but it's not. You get a darkness shield that depletes before your health starts going down. The enemy design is pretty crazy, but repetitive. I got tired of shooting the same demons all the time. The whole game overall is repetitive in nature because it uses the same few elements mixed around a lot. My least favorite idea was the 2D shooting levels. These were frustrating and felt like pointless filler. There's a fun boss fight at the end of the third level, but I could have gone without these.

After you beat the 8 hour game there's no reason to go back. There's no multiplayer or extra modes which is a shame. I guess if you want to collect all the red gems you can, but why bother? This is a fun weekend rental or cheap bargain bin purchase and nothing more. If it weren't for the repetition set throughout and those pointless 2D levels I would have liked this a lot more. Garcia is a hard character to like and the story is simple and straight forward. Overall through, this is a solid game and highly entertaining.

One thing is death match which means last monster truck around is the winner, and another one is called Cash Grab. This deals with destroying the most things, and getting all the powerups. For this stuff, there are powerups in which some say Monster Jam, and some are about making your monster truck go faster. If you collect enough of the Monster Jam powerups, and hit enough objects including other trucks, you will go into ""Monster Jam"" which basically means that you can hit anything without taking damage.

There are also guns you can pick up with your monster truck. To me, I don't really think they needed to add this to the game. If you get a gun though, you can easily get rid of a bunch of other monster trucks. And if someone else gets a gun in the game, your truck might be toast.

Now, that is the CORE of the game, but the there are Mini-Games which include 1 race inside a stadium, 1 race outside the stadium, an Island in which your goal is to knock the other monster trucks off the island, and they have 1 version of Freestyle.

For this type of stuff, the races aren't very good. They are bearable at least, but the Freestyle is completely awful. The Island level in which you knock off the other monster trucks is fun too.

Basically, as I said in the title, it's a Demolition Derby game. I think the Wii's Monster Jam Path of Destruction is better. That is not a Demolition Derby type of game. It has way better Freestyle, and way better Racing. The Racing involves outside of the stadium, and inside.

- Fun game
- VATS is something new for gaming.
- Open world with a lot to do (more than almost any other non-Bethesda game).
- Bethesda is a top developer. Todd Howard seems to be a great guy.
- A lot more voice acting than in prior Bethesda releases.
- Controls. Bethesda has the greatest view/camera system in the industry in my opinion. Simply click a button and you're in 1st person, click again you're in 3rd person -- all games should do this in my opinion -- it should be standard.

NEUTRAL
- Bobblehead. meh.
- Far less glitching and bugs than Oblivion. Oblivion had far fewer than Morrowind. Thus Bethesda is getting better and better at debugging.

CONS
- Pip-Boy is a poorly designed battery killer.
- Graphics and animation have unfortunately not been improved since the time of Oblivion. This was a key disappointment to me. I know everything is supposed to look run-down and devastated, but that doesn't mean it has to look graphically mediocre.

3.0,True,"09 10, 2015",A19ZAJ00J6875U,B00I19TYW2,Silly Goose,"Alien is certainly interesting from an aesthetic point of view, and its unique use of lighting and physics provide one of the most promising new directions to the survival horror game genre I have ever seen... but, the holistic experience of the game truly lacks depth and development. You would expect that if the environment of the game can be so dynamic, then the experience of the game should be dynamic. The problem is that the game is very static and repetitive, and especially weak in the combat department (you can't even jump in this game).

To summarize, you find yourself on a desolate space station that, as the game progresses, grows increasingly hostile and by the end basically everything is trying to kill you. And, everything WILL succeed in killing you in this game. Dying is the single one thing that you will do very very well without any effort in this game. You will die so many times it actually becomes comical. And then it just gets annoying, because the game itself isn't getting any more interesting or fun or dynamic: it just getting more effective at killing you.

That being said, let's think about what makes a game fun and dynamic in the first place. Stealth and survival are a good place to start, but not a good place to end. For instance, Metal Gear Solid forces the player to use stealth tactics to navigate, but it also forces the player to think strategically about how to enter combat: you can't just hide from everything the entire game. In Alien, fighting your way out of a jam is either very difficult in cumbersome, or just not even remotely possible (you cannot even injure the alien). This makes you feel like hiding is basically your default in this game, rather than an option or a strategy that provides the most benefit. Without any development in combat, the merits of the survival horror genre don't get expressed. In Resident Evil or Silent Hill, deciding when to fight and when to run is crucial to conserving your survival supplies. In Alien, mostly, your survival supplies don't aid you much and so basically you're better off just running and hiding. It feels like a game with its tail between its legs.

The existence of story and character development is also preferable in video games. The story of Alien is this: you're constantly getting killed by things in an isolated space ship where life is no longer viable. Good luck with that. Characters? Not really here. You meet people and they basically get killed... which foreshadows you getting killed.

Don't get me wrong, I was excited for this game, and I do think most people would at least enjoy playing for 5-10 hours, but after that it becomes monotonous because the holistic experience of the game isn't fully developed. Aesthetically and conceptually, Alien: Isolation IS an achievement, and that truly gave this game a leg up for doing something new and interesting. And it did, for the firs 5 hours or so, and then the game just stopped evolving. The last 75% of this game is like the first 25% of this game, without any changes or development, but just on steroids, and it leaves you feeling frustrated.

3.0,False,"02 22, 2013",AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B006QRNKOO,Arnold,"Here are my thoughts after playing the game for a while. I'll update it once I beat the whole game.

STORY/AMBIENCE

It's nice that Nintendo really tried to infuse Skyward Sword with a story. It actually works for the most part. The scenes between Zelda and Link are really touching. And for once Gannondorf isn't the main villain!

That said, while the story itself is fine, it just doesn't have the same epic feel Twilight Princess did. First, Skyloft feels a bit silly. I have nothing against riding birds, but it just can't compare with riding a horse as the standard for a fantasy/adventure game. I feel like Nintendo wanted to make this game different but this was a case of throwing out the good with the bad.

Also, more fundamentally, the game just has a more lighthearted feel to it. Even after Zelda disappears, Zelda's father doesn't seem particularly scared and tells Link they'll have to start to look for her in the morning. Enemies aren't scary. For the first 2-3 hours, you'll spend most of your time talking to folks in Skyloft and finding cute little animals in a forest. It's just tough comparing this to Twilight Princess, which had beautifully haunting cutscenes, a chilling villain in Zant, and a melancholy ambience.

GRAPHICS

First, I'll address what was probably the most controversial aspect of the game: the graphics. When it was first revealed that the game had a pastel color palette, some fans complained that it looked too lighthearted and the characters too cartoonish. I was actually worried about this since I loved Twilight Princess' realistic style.

Fortunately, after getting a good sample of the game's artwork, I have to say I'm quite satisfied with the outcome. I still prefer Twilight Princess' realistic style, but Skyward Sword looks great. The characters look alive and they have a wide range of facial and emotional expressions.

The landscapes and stages are at least as detailed as in Twilight Princess. From a distance, the impressionistic style works really well. Sadly, unlike Twilight Princess, there's no Hyrule FIeld, which was always my favorite part. Also, the other landscapes don't quite have that epic feel and almost look like they could have come out of a kid's game. Make no mistake - they look good, but not quite epic.

SOUND

Because Skyward Sword has such a deep story, it's all the more disappointing that Skyward Sword doesn't have voice acting. The on-screen dialogue text worked for past Zelda games because the dialogue was short and often transactional in nature. However, there are cinematic cutscenes in Skyward Sword and the text dialogue just becomes a chore to read and really detracts from the story. Worst of all is when there's dialogue on the screen but the character's lips aren't movie.

The soundtrack is good, but not quite at the level of Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time. Again, as with the rest of the game, it's more lighthearted. It's tough to really judge while playing the game, so I'll have to wait until the full soundtrack is available for download.

GAMEPLAY

This is where Skyward Sword really shines. While I don't think the swordplay is necessarily a revolution, it does add a new dimension to the game. You actually have to think about HOW you slash and hack. The Wii MotionPlus or its equivalent will definitely be standard for any future Zelda games.

OVERALL

Skyward Sword is really hard to rate because it both exceeds expectations and disappoints. The impressionistic art style didn't bother me nearly as much as I'd feared. On the other hand, the game just feels a whole lot less epic than Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and especially Twilight Princess. I'll write an updated review once I finish the game (it is a long game) but in the meantime I give it 3.5 stars.

UPDATE (1/2/2012)

Took me longer to finish the game than I'd thought. It is a long game, with at least 50 hours of play, and I didn't even finish all of the side-quests. However, my initial review remains largely unchanged.

I think the root of the problem with the game is that it's a bit too much like a Mario game. Don't get me wrong, I love Mario. However, Zelda is supposed to be a different experience. In Zelda, the levels aren't just platforms, but rather supposed to be immersive worlds. Levels and challenges should feel like natural extensions of the story, not just ""fetch-quests."" By contrast, in Skyward Sword there were way too many ""fetch-quests"" and pointless activities just to vary up the game design. My least favorite was when the Water Dragon simply threw several dozen musical notes around an ocean and forced Link to swim around looking for them. I almost shouted in frustration.

Also, I think Nintendo made a huge mistake by not giving each of the dungeons a unique feel. It makes the game less memorable. I feel like I played and beat the game just a few days ago, but remember it less than I do Twilight Princess. Because the dungeons aren't entirely separate from the over world and are much smaller overall, they just don't stick out. I can't think back to the ""Water Dungeon"" or ""Sky Dungeon."" Separate dungeons also would have widened the variety of locales and the play experiences. As it stands, I felt like I was going back and forth over the same territory, which got tiring.

The non-playable characters all felt like add-ons and were fairly superficial. Unlike Twilight Princess, I didn't really find myself caring for any of them. One of the first side-quests is to help a mother find her child. My first though was that any mother dumb enough to let her child wander around on a floating city with no side rails and monsters running around at night deserves to lose her kid. Zelda's dad seems entirely unconcerned that his daughter is missing and possibly kidnapped by an evil demon. None of these characters actually helps you in your quest. Except for Groose. I ended up loving him. He had real character and actually does try to become more than simply a helpless victim.

The bosses just didn't meet my expectations. There actually are a lot fewer than in Twilight Princess, especially if you don't count the multiple times you fight Ghirahim or the Imprisoned. Ghirahim actually worked well as a boss and was the only time I felt like the motion controls added anything to the game. I also liked smacking Koloktos with the giant sword. Other than that, the bosses were too easy and not particularly memorable. The final boss, Demise, was pathetically easy once you figure out that you have to use the Skyward Strike. The designs are certainly nothing like the intimidating beasts from Twilight Princess.

Finally, I really have to reemphasize that the lack of voice acting is noticeable. Other Zelda games told the story more through images and narration. Here, so much of the cutscenes and story involve dialogue. It just looks and sounds ridiculous watching these scenes but only hearing odd grunts and sighs.

Overall, I stick by my rating of 3.5 stars. It's a good game, but really could have and should have been so much better.",not so epic,1361491200,7,,

+Nice Graphics
+Some really well played ideas, monsters, traps, and levels.
+Looks like Silent Hill Downpour (Might be the same graphic engine)
+Easy to play like Resident Evil 4.

Cons
-Extreme wide screen?! And what for? I still don't know, it makes your big screen now chopped in half for no reason!
-Looks like Silent Hill BUT isn't creepy or scary at all. Plays like Resident Evil 4 but has way too much action to be survival horror.
-Boring Characters
-Uninspired story which half way through the game you won't care about anymore.
-texture pops
-Long loading screens even after you pre load the disc.
-Half of the game has poor level design, very lame and boring. Walking through cities in broad daylight. Not scary at all.
-THe camera is too close to your lead player. Like RE4 but really a lot closer to where you cant really see some of his actions when he does them. I never got used to this and bugged me the entire game.

In a nutshell this is what your dealing with. A bad spin off idea of another Silent Hill. Looks like SH and has a kinda SH plot...But has way too much action in it to be SH. Plays like RESIDENT EVIL 5 really more than 4 and has as much action as RE6. Which that game was terrible. Im looking for scares and terror not an action film. Has elements of Splinter cell/manhunt/hitman stealth attacks but doesnt really fit. And even a taste of ODDWORLD with the strange and random bombs you have to handle to shut them down. Seriously? Bombs? Are the Zombie creature things taking time to set bombs? I played the game all the way through once, I don't think I will be picking it up again for sometime. Play Silent Hill Downpour or Resident Evil 4/5 instead. They are more of a solid play through and know what game they want to be. Rent if you can before you buy. Also, big note **If your like me and got fooled into thinking you would be playing another (Resident Evil 1 remake) where your in a haunted mansion type place trying to find your way out YOUR NOT!

3.0,False,"09 11, 2010",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B0016B28WU,Trenton Bennett,"There's one very annoying thing about the Game of the Year Edition for the PS3 that makes me glad I didn't pay extra for it: it's no different than the regular edition. While the PC version offers extras, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare for the PS3 no longer gives you the bonus map pack (or anything else) for paying extra and purchasing the Game of the Year Edition.  Any additional map packs (I found one, the ""Variety Map Pack"") have to be downloaded from the PlayStation store for an extra fee. If you're looking at the GotY edition for the purpose of multiplayer, keep this in mind as nothing extra comes in the GotY and the ""Variety"" map pack costs extra to purchase. The ""bonus map pack"" referred to on Activision's site was a limited-time-only promotion.

Now that I've played this game on the PC, XBox 360, and PS3, I have to say that the XBox 360 feels just a bit better--but the PS3's translation is still very good. As a PC Gamer coming to consoles, I have a hard time finding a first-person shooter that I'm even barely competent in. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare for the PS3 has been one of the best translations for me (my other favorite is the Orange Box). It has a very ""playable"" feel, making my WASD-familiar brain feel very comfortable switching over to the PS3's controller.  While I've seen more than one title using very obvious auto-aim, making your reticle snap-to and stick or making anyone in the neighborhood of your shots magically sprout magnets and pull fire to them, CoD: Modern Warfare doesn't do this. Instead it just makes it easier for me to center on my target while I'm running and/or crouching, jumping, etc.--it's like the right stick moves consistently smoother. That makes it just plain easier to multi-task. Given that I typically have some pretty hefty hardware on the PC, I wasn't certain if the PS3 version would match the quality of my high-end gaming machine.  I was pleasantly surprised when things looked just as sharp on the console as they do on the PC:  the programmers definitely took advantage of the PS3's unique hardware.

I've now played this game's Single-Player Campaign through more than once, and loved it. Like other titles in the Call of Duty series, it uses team-based play, and simulates your team using the computer to ""drive"" your teammates. Continuing in the tradition of the other titles, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare adds more structure to the missions, more life to the characters, and more depth to the story. You spend most of the game as new recruit 'Soap' MacTavish, but you also get to flash back to an earlier point in the story, play as your commanding officer, and learn more about him.

One odd departure from other games is that there are storyline sequences that are not exactly ""playable"", but neither are they cutscenes. You live a segment of the storyline through the eyes of the person going through it. These are short, so they don't frustrate, and what they do is heighten the drama. It's an interesting technique, and because it isn't overused, it works well here to keep the storyline going.

Another great pacing trick is that the storyline spans countries. It crosses continents and it puts you in more than one spot: one of my favorites was manning three guns using night-vision cameras aboard a large plane as it provides air support to your team on the ground. Overall, the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare graphics are very detailed, the environments feel authentic, and the sounds impressed me. I liked the dialogue and I really enjoyed the fact that my teammates seemed to be somewhat intelligent. There were some really neat goals in each mission, and I have fond memories of the adrenaline rush.

You play hero X, get involved with a grand malevolent scheme, thwart evil plans... blah blah blah.  The story takes a huge back seat in this game, moving on.

The combat is the highlight of this game I believe, as should be expected of the makers of the Star Ocean series.  You have your choice from a few different weapons each having unique attacks that you earn through use.  You can combine up to 5 of these standard attacks to form your combo any way you see fit.  You eventually learn one power attack (Volty Attack) for each weapon.  I pretty much hack and slashed my way through every battle even though you can block and counter.  I found that after you had attacks that could break the enemies guard you had basically won the fight.  You can also call on your partners to use their various attacks once you get to a point in the story.  Finally you can change formations on the fly which allow you to surround enemies and pound them or do flanking formations and other such things.  The only thing that sucks about all of this is that you gradually open these features with the story so you're forced to wait quite a while before combat gets even remotely interesting.

Combat aside, this game is basically one big distraction of collecting friends Suikoden style.  The crappy part is you don't get a castle/stronghold like in Suikoden, you simply collect 100+ equally worthless allies (Because your main character is all that really matters) while you wait for something to happen in the story.  This drove me completely bonkers.  I was so bored sometimes in this game I would repeatedly have to sleep or leave my game running just to get the story to advance because quite frankly I didn't care to collect every character after a while.  In Suikoden you felt compelled to collect everybody because every now and again they acutally did something additional for you like sell you stuff or teleport you, not the case in Radiata Stories.

In summary, this is a collection game.  The story is superficial and cliche, the combat is fun but one dimensional, and everything takes a side note to making friends.

But all I have to tell you is that Natsume made a big mistake of the concept of using the stylus for the entire game which makes the controls really annoying.

Graphics
Typical Harvest moon graphics, you pretty much the same as the other Harvest Moon for DS

Sounds
I love the music in the Spring time pretty good and upbeating. I pretty much like all the Harvest moon music.

Gameplay
Great concepts, you have to get money to buy a new bridge and get more people on the island. The more you plant and gain more money and get more shippments, the more people will come.

Controls
By far the worst part, but yet the most important part. I know I complained about the stylus, but you use it for your tools, moving around shipping and pretty much everything. The Control pad and Buttons are only good to select crops or your weapons, but it is easy at this point to use the stylus.  L and R buttons are pointless, it makes your character run, but you have your stylus do it for your automatically.

Maybe I have not got use to the stylus or controls part, but I like using the D-pad to move and the buttons to farm.  It is sort of annoying because you farm much slower.  Meaning you have to go to the square and tap the stylus and then move again and do it again.  Now it was easy just using the D-pad, but it is a pain with the style because the character does not move where you tell him/her to do.

Also, you can not use the cheating method of getting something out of your rugsack easily you have to go tap the menu and then put it in your read box and then ship it. Then it asks you the question do you really want to ship it.  I am not so sure if you loose friendship points if you litter or not.

Natsume would have hit the mark if they implemented the controls like the other Harvest Moon games.

I really wanted to love this game, it has a great story, great voice acting...the driving and shooting are not half bad. Unfortunately, thats where the good really ends. The graphics, while not as bad as reviewers have said, leave a lot to be desired. At best they are certainly not up to snuff for a current gen console, there is a lot of drop in and texture drop.

With the demeanor of the times(1968) and the attitude of the cops, throwing in what pretty much amounts to a big cheat in their favor, makes you want to just seek them out and kill them ( In the game, not in real life ).  The icing on this case is losing half of what you have in your pocket when you die, again, I have to throw the BS flag here. It would be different if you had the ability to offload the money in your pocket in more locations, but you have to keep driving allllllllllll the way back to Sammy's bar, just to make a deposit. This compounds the problem of trying to save up for a better gun or an upgrade, especially when you have to keep buying ammo at pretty inflated costs. The guns and ammo don't interchange, which is realistic, but frustrating. So you will likely have to endure Lincoln's painfully slow reload speed and other base abilities for not having enough cash to BUY that upgrade you already had to work to get unlocked. While we're on that topic, how is it that Lincoln is ex military special forces and performs so clumsy?
The game has potential and can be a lot of fun at times. You definitely get into the revenge vibe and the cut scenes and overall story keep you stoked. But the aforementioned issues will make you want to throw the controller across the room...a lot.

The game is about Faith, a runner in a futuristic totalitarian world were everyone is under surveillance and any opposition to the powers at are quelled.
Faith finds herself part of a murder plot and she goes out to finds out the who's and why's.

Mirror's Edge main attraction is the gameplay as all of it is from a first person view and most of the time the player is running around climbing, jumping, sliding, and flying around than shooting. It's a weird experience to play and would advise people that are susceptible to motion sickness to either take precautions or not play the game.
Controls for the game are pretty easy to get used to so most players should be pulling the basic maneuvers pretty fast.
Graphics are kinda mix bag for me as the textures are nice but not great because everything is white washed, even though it fits the primary color's only future.
Music is pretty good and fits to the game well blending into the background making the player feel like Faith is wearing a MP3 player while running. Plus the theme to the game, Still Alive sung by Lisa Miskovsky, really nice sounding.

First, I would like to say to parents, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR CHILDREN UNDER 18.  The game does contain some nudity and suggestive themes and is very violent.

I was impressed by the game play and graphics.  It was like Devil May Cry meets 300.  The games contain killer combos and a great upgrade system, but there is one thing about the game that bothered me.
I consider myself a fairly good gamer, but there were points in GOW that frustrated me to no end.  Even changing it to easy did not seem to make a difference.  For example, in the Hades level you have to climb up rotating pillars, while blades are rotating around.  Sounds simple enough right?  Wrong, you touch one and you fall all the way down to the bottom and start over.  This is just one of many frustrating obstacles.  With that being said though, for some reason the game compels you to keep trying and eventually get through it no matter how many times you have to try.  I am starting on GOW II now and so far so good.

PROS:
-Great graphics and story.
-Good control.
-Great value.

CONS:
-May be too difficult at times for some gamers. I would definitely recommend this game, but beware if you are just a casual gamer.  The quest will not be easy.  If you like this game you may also like the Devil May Cry series if your PS3 is backwards compatible.

First off: the graphics were magnificent.  The use of graphics is fantastic!  When u grind a rail, u really think your seeing a replay of a competition.  The snow dust and tracks behind you is incredible.  This was the first game I saw for Xbox, and it really showed the graphics it could support.  The mountains, people, you look so realistic, you'll think you really did get dropped off on a slope.
The gameplay is ok...up to a point.  In the game, your ranked from beggining to end.  The goal is to get ranked as the #1 boarder in the world.  You start out at 150.  I got up to 75, then I was just stuck.  The goals they set inside the rank of 80 are incredibly hard...up to a frustrating point.  But hey, if you think u can master it, go for it.  The creativity, I must admit, in the gameplay is fantastic.  The use of sponsers and media is pretty cool.  During the game u unlock sponsers.  Sponsers (:Dragon's Wear: for example) give u new clothes (jackets, hats), gear (gogles, snowboards), and new parks to board in.  This game would have been a blast and ground breaking if it wasn't so hard.  This is one of 2 things that really killed the game.
The options: thankfully, one of the things this game lacked was not options.  U can do single run (just a run down any mountain you've opened with any pro u pick), multiplayer (which really [...]), career, and preferences (where u baslicly decide what music u want to listen to; your own soundtrack or the game's).  In career, u can board down any mountain you've unlocked.  Pick your outfit from what clothes you;ve been given (by a sponser), board against a pro.  This game may be quite hard, but at least it had enough options.
WHAT RUINED IT:  Two things changed this game from a 5 star to a 3 star.  The first was the difficulty.  It just gets to hard!  The second was absolutely HUGE!  The multiplayer in this game was horrible!  There is no split screen, no racing.  All u can do is board down a mountain one at a time, trying to get the best score.  But the stupid part is, the second player has to match or out do the 1st player's trick!  I mean, come on.  This game could have been an awsome multiplayer if u could race down a hill with these types of graphics, and or a split screen trick game.  This game would have flown off the shelves if there would have been some sort of multiplayer creativity.
Thats my review on this game, and for it's price, you might want to counsider getting it.  But don't expect anything ground breaking.  This is an average game for an excellent system.

It takes forever to grow back. It doesn't matter whether you run on it or walk gently on it, it kills the grass. I talked to Nintendo and they told me coming in contact with the grass will kill it. So if you don't want to kill the grass, don't play the game. That's just stupid. The grass in the game is so delicate, it seems like it dies if you look at it wrong. Seems like the developers have never seen grass in real life and imagine it to be this super fragile thing that dies if you touch it. Real grass is not that fragile!!!

The limited item distribution is a pain in the you know where. There really isn't any reason for it to be limited. It's not like Nintendo's know for their awesome online play and infrastructure. Half the time you try to get those time/location limited items and the Nintendo Zone is down and you're out of luck. It's little thing like this that leaves a bad taste in otherwise enjoyable game.

The storage options in the game is LIMITED. With all the stuff that you can get in the game, there's hardly any space to put them. There's no reason why the space is SO limited. They could've made the space hundred folds or have an option of building a self storage unit in town. How limited the storage space is mindblowingly stupid. It's not like it's real space. It's just some bits. You can use a 64GB (micro)SD in the console. There's no reason to have almost unlimited storage in the game.

It doesn't have paid DLC thankfully. Although new Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer should have been a DLC or expansion for something like $7.99 instead of full blown game.

While the city is big, there's very little with which you can interact. Buildings you can actually enter are rare. There's no reason why Watch Dogs could not have been developed with ""linear levels"" instead of a vast open world with little to do.

I'll get this out of the way first. The game works well. I only ran into a single campaign bug in which a scripted event did not trigger, forcing me to exit and replay a small section since my last checkpoint. On Xbox 360, this game looks fine. While I don't believe it is one of the best looking games on Xbox 360, at no point did I think I needed to play it on the newer hardware. That said, I don't believe this game is a ""new hardware seller"" -- there's no reason to buy the newest hardware based on the gameplay.

I played the campaign, and stuck mostly to the campaign. The campaign is LONG. I don't quite know how long, but the game is divided into five ""acts"", each of which has countless missions. Act 2 is the longest. By the time I made it to the middle of Act 2, I was ready for the game to be over. There's simply no reason to care about the story. It is not emotional, and Aiden's motivation for his actions is unconvincing. The secondary characters are equally boring and unimportant.

Gameplay involves going to a location and either hacking something or killing somebody. Be prepared to drive...A LOT. This is the problem with open-world games -- developers purposefully make reasons for you to traverse the map. Making things particularly challenging is that ""fast travel"" across the map is disabled during missions. Therefore, you MUST drive. Once you get to your destination, you can either stealthily reach your goal or go in guns-a-blazing. While the former makes things easy, both are just as easy. If you're patient (which makes the game even longer), you can take a nearly all-stealth approach. The stealth approach does draw you in, however -- it is very immersive.

Variations on missions include guiding somebody to safety, stealthily of course, or taking down enemies who are driving a vehicle. The take-down missions were extremely painful. The game offers multiple environmental offensive/defensive obstacles that you can trigger. Sometimes you are being pursued, sometimes you are pursuing, but usually you are dealing with both -- you are pursuing somebody AND somebody is pursuing you. The problem is that typically, you can't time the environmental obstacles just right. Additionally, you only unlock them as you gain XP and spend points to unlock various abilities. Take-down missions usually always end in a shootout. And it's quite easy to die, especially if backup or police were in pursuit, which means you need to complete the entire take-down mission again.

I had to play some of the missions repeatedly because checkpoints are bad, you take damage quickly, and objectives are not clear. Repeatedly playing the same sequences isn't my idea of ""fun"". A more forgiving checkpoint system would have prevented this feeling I got from the game.

While the city is ""alive"", it's not necessarily bustling. You can hack people for money -- but there's very little use for money in the game. You can buy materials to craft weapons -- explosives, blackouts, etc. -- but since you can also find these materials in most missions, it seems unnecessary. There's a bit of traffic in the game, but very few parked cars. For a game that places a heavy emphasis on driving, this seems counter-intuitive.

I barely touched the sidequests in this game, only because the campaign was long enough for me. Sidequests have no impact on the story or your progress, so there's no point in completing them. You can complete the campaign easily on ""normal"" without completing any optional sidequests, while unlocking a majority of the skills. Which makes me ask: ""why are there sidequests?""

Very little of the story is delivered through cutscenes, with most of it being delivered in phone conversations. This is annoying at times, because once you complete a mission, you often have to wait through one or more telephone conversations before you get your next objective. And if you quit, you'll have to listen to the same conversations again the next time you start the game, before your objective marker is shown to you.

I think Watch Dogs is a game that has to be experienced, only because it promised so much. In the end, however, it was extremely slow, boring, and repetitive.

The plastic is a bit thicker than the official headset, which makes the Plantronics feel more sturdy and less like a toy.  You are still gonna look silly wearing it...

It produces similar sound quality to the official wired headset, so no issue there.

The problem I had found is that the mic doesn't pick up the voice you transmit as soon as the official headset.  This means that your first word you speak is normally cut off when you talk.  So whenever I use the headset I normally lead my talking with a noise or an ""umm"" to get the mic picking up the sound so everything I say is heard.

Mirror's Edge is a fully immersive first person parkour / free running game where you play as a runner named Faith.  She works for an underground resistance against a corrupt government.  Beautifully rendered Urban Jungles are her playground as she dashes from rooftop to rooftop, wall running, jumping, and climbing along the way.  The first person (3d view) free running in the game is pretty amazing.  You actually feel like you are doing all of these amazing things and it's incredibly exciting.

Mirror's Edge also shows you exactly where you need to go.  It highlights the 'trick lines' red as you get near them.  Success depends on timing and correct button presses.  Most of the time, it's easy to figure out where you need to go and it's a blast getting there.

Here comes the bad...  The checkpoints are fairly generous, but you die for any slight mistake.  If your timing is a bit off, you die.  If you hit the wrong button, you die.  If enemies are shooting at you and you slow down, you die.  When there are enemies shooting at you, it's literally a hail of gunfire.  It doesn't matter if you turn a corner, they fire nonstop.  It's like there's a floating barge of machine guns just behind the camera.

The combat is also bad.  You can perform martial arts on the cops and you can kick out of any free running move.  Wall run kick, sliding kick, jumping kick...  The problem is that there are a lot of cops and if you try to fight one, the rest end up shooting you.  You can press a button to slow time and that helps you disarm them, but that's all you get.  If your timing is off while you are disarming an enemy, they kill you.  At one point, I took a cop's shotgun, put the cursor over his face and pulled the trigger at point blank range... and missed.  The cop killed me.

The game looks beautiful, but when it plays a cutscene, it's completely cell shaded.  They look like Esurance Commercials.  I expected someone to yell, ""Quote, Buy, Print!""  I dunno who was in charge of this, but cutscenes are supposed to look BETTER than the gameplay.

There also isn't much chance to explore the levels and unlike Assassin's Creed, the game is very linear.  Replay Value is pretty nonexistent, unless you want to try the time trials, where you play through the levels fast.

The game is 9 Chapters long and should take you about 7-8 hours to finish.

Overall, when you create an innovative game, you don't have the time to solve all of the original problems that you find and the execution ends up being flawed.  If they do a sequel, it will probably be really good.

Who should buy this game?
Buy it if you are a fanboy, a collector, or you love Esurance.

Rent it if you liked the demo, have a low threshold for deaths, and want to experience free running.

Otherwise, avoid this one.

Invizimals mixes the classic ""catch-em-all"" gameplay with the relatively new technology of Augmented Reality (AR) to move the story and battles away from imaginary far off places.  Instead, the story takes place in the real world, and the battles are on the table, desk, or floor in front of you.

I've been playing with AR demos for some time, so when this finally came out in the US (almost a year after it released in EU and Japan) I picked it up.

Invizimals is clearly aimed at a much younger audience.  The acting is a bit cheesy and the interface is rather simplistic.

Unfortunately the developers didn't think to add subtitles to the videos.  My brother is the only other adult I know with a PSP who would be likely to enjoy this game, but he is deaf which prevents him from hearing any of the story and important information on capturing the Invizimals.  So a word of warning to deaf gamers and the parents of deaf children, this game is not deaf friendly.

As a hearing person I also would have greatly appreciated subtitles due to the fact that all of the actors have prominent accents and are occasionally difficult to understand.

Invizimals are unlocked for capture by completing the main story.  Unfortunately you must also capture one of each unlocked Invizimal in order to continue the story.  If you have difficulty capturing an Invizimal for any reason you will be stuck until you are successful.

The battles are presented in real-time rather than being turn based.  As long as your Invizimal has enough stamina you can attack or block repeatedly, and so can your opponent, which makes for some interesting changes in strategy.

The good
1) It actually looks very good
2) It has a volume and a mute button (and that's it) so it's simple that way
3) It plugs into the controller rather than the system which I like a lot
4) The sound coming through the headset that I can hear (my friends in the PSN chat) sound much cleaner and crisper than my old headset.

The Bad
1) The ear piece is only on the left side, you cannot move it to the right side.  I'm used to my mic/ear piece being on the right so it was strange.  I prefer the option to move it from one side of my head to the other.
2) According to my friends, the mic sounded much lower and ""fuzzier"" than my normal mic (also part of a twenty dollar headset)

3) and this is the big one - This thing HURTS to wear. I came home and my boyfriend was using it.  He said it hurt the side of his head and he really didn't know how long he'd be able to put up with it.  He has a fairly round noggin so I offered to use it and swap him out with my headset.  I was thinking, I have a much smaller head so it probably won't hurt my head.  I was wrong.  The part on the right side that holds the thing in place wasn't shaped to my head properly so it dug into my ear.  I actually had to hook it on my ear to keep the headset from sliding off to the left, but in the meantime it was stabbing the right side of my head.

Basically, you race around Springfield as one of up to 17 characters and in one of six locations, picking up people and racing to drop them off somewhere else on time, sometimes avoiding hitting other cars, sometimes trying to devastate the town to earn extra time and money. As you earn money by driving people around, you unlock the locations and characters. There are also some missions in which you basically try to run over a certain number of objects in a certain span of time.  The ultimate goal is to earn a million dollars (about 100 attempts) to run Mr. Burns' nuclear buses out of business.
The game is quite fun out of the box. Apparently, the actors recorded speech for the game and the quips are amusing (if occasionally non sequiturs).  The cars are amusing and Springfield is amazingly detailed. For a fan, it's especially entertaining as it contains a lot of side references to the series that you will appreciate if you are a devotee.  Those not terribly fluent in the Simpsons will still like it (you wouldn't be buying it if you didn't like the show) but won't appreciate the little details a Simpson's nutcase (like myself) will.
However, the fun wears off rather quickly. The game is repetitive. And the victory animation is disappointing.  The missions are especially poor - you figure out what path to take in order to complete the mission in the alloted time, then keep doing it over and over (and over) again until you get it right.

The first days it felt awkward, but then it grew on me and became almost second nature. Sadly it's not the device I was hoping it would be. I really wanted the SC to be my only input device for gaming in the living room, but if like me, you play a large variety of PC games, you will still need a console controller and a k/m combo to be able to play all your games in the best way possible.

The SC works fine on many types of games although to be honest it's never as good as the devices it tries to replace. For controller games it's never as good as a controller, and for mouse games it's never as good as a mouse. It's strength relies in that it allows you to play mouse based games which would be difficult with a controller (using a software such as Controller Mate), and play controller games much better than you can with a k/m combo.

The SC controller works great for many games designed for console controllers such as third person games, platformers, etc, and also mouse games that do not require much precision such as tower defense, city builders, or other casual games. But it fails at twin stick shooters since it only has 1 analog stick and the joystick virtualization is not so good, or games that rely on a Dpad because the pad on the left is terrible as a Dpad. Games that require quick mouse precision such as FPS are simply terrible with the SC.

Multiplayer: Is very well organize and user friendly, making it very easy to access fellow drivers in the GT community. However, a patch is needed for ""Shuffle racing mode"" as you can only enter a course in the main lobby/free run and not during a race.

Music:(N/A) As I always have the music off or if I do want to listen to music, I just turn on my stereo system.

  -Improved online interface
  -Variety of racing modes (Karts, rally, NASCAR... etc)
  -Supports wide selection of racing wheels
  -Ability to add own ""in-game"" soundtrack
  -PlayStation eye compatible

  -Cons
  -The extreme lack of cockpit views and exterior detailings with numerous standard models which consists of the majority of all the cars in the game.
  -Damage system is ambitious but rubbish. A failed attempt and the fans are to blame for this as they have asked for it but never use it to its full potential during races as they tend to use ""bumper car"" techniques to gain pole positions and by having damage ""permanently on"" would impede their game plan in winning a race.
  -""3D"" is wasted on this game. Let me put it this way; how many people do you honestly know have a Television that supports 3D?
  -B-spec mode
  -Photo mode (I have 91 in game friends and the average pics anyone of them have is around 2-3).

  -Engine noise is not very convincing at all when paired to the vehicle its suppose to represent.

-only 10 bowser minigames
-if team Mario actually does make it to the finish line, bowser can still stall them. What happens is bowser gets to hide a star in one of three characters and team mario has to guess it to win. Even when playing as bowser, I found this rather obnoxious.

-amiibo party has merits since it is classic Mario Party but is very crippled. For instance if you want to hit the dice, you have to tap your amiibo on the NFC.

Pro:

+Intuitive ""sideways remote"" control system.  Basically, treat the wii-mote like the wing of your plane, and fly by tilting the wing.

Cons:

-Hard to discern different types of targets.  Bombers looked like every bomber, and I couldn't tell the difference between trucks and heavy armor in convoy.

-For a game where all you really see is the back of your airplane, the graphics leave much to be desired.  I don't buy into the ""wii graphics"" criticism, since games are all about fun, not pretty sights.  However, I've seen better on the 'Cube and PS2.

-Designer tries to give you a ""sense of speed"" by simply blurring the already ""hastily-rendered"" graphics.

-Targeting mechanism overly forgiving.

This is the type of game where the Wii should be an upgrade over other ""next-gen"" competitors due to the unique and fun control schemes.  In fact, this game was a step back.  It felt hastily put together and not well planned-out.  It seemed like they took the game engine from the existing 'Angels game, stripped it to its bare bones, slapped motion sensitivity onto it, and overly-simplified the graphics to the point where the Wii doesn't even break a sweat.

3.0,False,"11 22, 2016",AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00FK6VVA2,Aiex Halo,"this is the same running titles of my reviews on these.  I started with Emperor Rise of the Middle Kingdom and worked chronologically back, although I had played some of them, mostly this one Caesar III as a child but could never get passed the second mission.

Having thoroughly familiarized myself with Pharaoh (https://www.amazon.com/review/R19HRZGE7VFDUJ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm), it made it easier to pick up on Caesar III as apparently Pharaoh's game model and point system started here in Caesar III.  Caesar III is far more generous with money and emergency funds than Pharaoh is.  Also, the game runs without issue on Windows 10 (after setting the compatibility mode to run in 16 bit color) and it does not crash constantly like Pharaoh does.

to start with, this game is not as much of a chronological nightmare as Caesar IV was, in which one mission took place in a certain year BC, and the very next mission took place ostensibly 50 years later, but had the year labelled AD so it was actually centuries later, and roughly has the missions set on the right years, so you can build up Mediolanium starting in 220 BC and suffer Carthaginian invasions, or start expanding into Gaul or Hispania around 70 BC and so on.  The main chronological issue is that there is always a ""Caesar"" emperor to report to, despite it being in BC during the Republic.  Ostensibly it's easier to just have a Caesar emperor exist rather than have it be ""The Senate requests 10 Iron within 24 months"" for some reason.

Much of the gameplay mechanics in Pharaoh are taken from this.  However, there are certain features which actually make me nostalgic for Pharaoh.

Water is an even bigger issue here than even in Pharaoh, where it was a huge issue.  Rather than dredge up groundwater, good water here is got from reservoirs which you must place next to lakes/rivers/oceans to fill up, then connect with each other using aqueducts.  The reservoirs never collapse or catch fire and don't need employees so this is good.  However, the range of the reservoirs to get a Fountain or a Baths working is EXTREMELY small, and there's no option for underwater piping (which DID exist in ancient Rome, made of lead) so you have to constantly build  reservoirs and a patchwork of aqueducts which overlap your roads like modern day highways and can make your city look unbelievably ugly as hell while barely providing running water.

Basically every residential area you build has to follow along with the reservoir system if you want it to evolve beyond ugly hairy-looking shacks, and to do so means that no neighborhood will ever be particularly large without masses of aqueducts interrupting blocks and taking up space.  What's even worse, for some reason the Reservoirs cause a penalty to desirability so you're basically completely screwed if you want a neatly populated high end neighborhood --- you'll have as many statues/gardens as you have houses to get to high end mansions.

One good thing they didn't do for Pharaoh was make Fire and Police into one building, the Praefecture.  Unfortunately, they are arguably worthless.  Being generous, I would say the praefects are HALF as effective as their Pharaoh counterparts --- fires are NON.  STOP.  NONSTOP.  NONSTOP.  I demolished an entire block of rubble, former housing, replaced them ALL with Praefectures, numbering nearly 14 or 15.  FIRES.  EVERYWHERE.  They kept burning.  They are even more worthless when it comes to crime, although this can be more easily alleviated with festivals and city-wide improvements to Mood and such.

There's no monument building objectives; instead the rating is replaced with Peace Rating, which means absolutely nothing and only seems to measure how much time has passed and how many invasions you've beaten back.  This leads directly to another issue: Every single mission past the 2nd one, whether Peaceful or Warlike mission, will have NONSTOP enemy invasions.  You likely won't need Legionaries for the Peaceful missions, but you absolutely should have at least 4 forts of Auxilia because the invasions never stop, and it's an incredibly annoying hassle.

There's only about 10 missions or so (15 total, since you pick between Peaceful and Military missions) which makes the game feel remarkably short, especially compared to Pharaoh which seemed to have 15 missions per campaign era, and like 8 different eras, not including the 4 added by Cleopatra expansion.  In just 1 day I've finished 5 of the missions in Caesar III.  Several of them are much easier than Pharaoh missions were, while others are easy but made pointlessly more complicated by the Population requirement.

This wouldn't be that big of a deal for me if not for the fact that for two missions in a row (one Warlike, one Peaceful) I was put in maps where I basically had to import my food.  My city took up half the map and had only about 2900 citizens.  I had achieved all the other scores (Culture, Prosperity, Peace, Favor), but couldn't yet win because I needed 6000 people in my city.  Considering the instability of importing food on housing evolution, this was less a natural victory condition and more just a case of ""spam as much housing as possible at the very end to cheese victory""

The Gods are another big fat issue.  Pharaoh did good in changing it so you only worship 1-5 of them per mission.  Here, you worship all 5 of the gods in every single mission, so you have to put up with 5 whiny angry babies constantly begging for attention and doing severe damage to your city if you ignore them.

Ultimately enduring the game is miserable, as you experience serial arsonist-level fires NONSTOP no matter how many praefectures you build, pretty much nonstop invasions even on peaceful missions, having to place countless reservoirs and almost as many miles of aqueduct as miles of road, setting down fountains and seeing a house 4 blocks away saying it needs access to water, and the mindblowing problem on a high resolution screen of sometimes being unable to tell the difference between a hairy shack and a pile of burnt rubble.",might make you hate Rome,1479772800,,,

The only drawback is that although I selected this game based on the demo's game play; I became bored with it. The map is so HUGE, so huge that you will need to either call for an extraction or fly to most locations on the map. Average time flying from one side of the map to the other is about 8 minutes...maybe too HUGE. Weapon system is great compared to GTA IV; there are more then 12 weapons to choose from and they do a lot of damage! The ""HEAT"" system is a little annoying because every time you do ANYTHING wrong soldiers come out of no where and open fire on you. It gets old fast and is very annoying if you are searching to complete settlements. The flow and control of driving cars is good but flying a plane is horrible. After you have successfully taken off and need to land, you will always have to abandon the vehicle because attempting to land, even on a flat runway will result in death as the plane's landing is too sensitive. Although, this is a minor drawback it offered more then GTA IV did in this area. In my book making it better than GTA IV but I would still say GTA SA was by far the best game of this genre and maybe of its time.

3.0,False,"08 28, 2015",ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B00004W4R0,Kane&#039;s Review,"WCW Backstage Assault is a mixed bag as many people since its November 2000 release have given mixed (mainly bad) reviews on the game that is Backstage Assault. I recently bought this game for a relatively cheap price to see how the game was for myself so here it is. For starters I want to say that when you play this for the first time, it's ridiculously difficult to even try and set up a match. Finally once you've managed to get past the annoying superstar selection screen, you get to choose from 7 different areas to fight your opponent in that include a truck arena, the locker rooms, the loading bay, bathrooms, the block, the parking garage, and the media center. The only available area upon first playing the game is the truck arena. All other areas must be unlocked, but I'll get to that in a moment.

Backstage Assault has a fairly large roster containing most--if not all of the WCW superstars that were on TV in 1999 and 2000. It was also the first game to feature WCW women as default characters on the roster, making it one of the largest rosters in WCW's gaming history. Among the stars and women in this game include Goldberg, Sting, Hulk Hogan, Jeff Jarrett, Major Gunns, Sid Vicious, Mona, Booker T, DDP, Kimberly, Rey Mysterio, Torrie Wilson, Scott Steiner, Miss Hancock, Vince Russo, Bret Hart, and many more. Of course with men and women on the roster, that also meant you could do several intergender matches. Want Goldberg to lay a beatdown on Major Gunns? You can make it happen. Want Torrie Wilson to beat Scott Steiner into submission? Go for it!

There are only 3 different matches to play. You can choose between regular, First Blood, or Human Torch. Regular and First Blood are pretty self-explanatory, while the Torch Match involves you having to set your opponent on fire to win the match.

There are 2 different features to play in this game that include Hardcore Challenge Mode and Hardcore Gauntlet. Hardcore Challenge Mode was pretty much similar to Mayhem's Quest For The Best Mode, only you were fighting backstage. The premise of Hardcore Challenge Mode involves you choosing a WCW superstar and playing as them through a series of backstage matches as you vie for the Hardcore, US, and World Titles. Along the way, with each match you win, you'll unlock new fighting areas, new weapons, and new women and superstars to play as.

Hardcore Gauntlet sees your superstar fight 7 other opponents in back to back matches with no time to rest or recover. If you lose a match, you can't replay it and will have to start all over again. And when the smoke clears, if you've managed to overcome and prevail in both the Hardcore Gauntlet and Hardcore Challenge Mode, then you just may find yourself among the top 10 in the Hall of Champions.

Now for the final part; gameplay. Gameplay pace moves at a similar, decent pace as it did in Mayhem. The only problem with the game is how unbelievably difficult it becomes to keep your opponent down for a 3 count. Seriously, I played a match with Goldberg against Jeff Jarrett and after nearly 5 minutes of constantly driving Jarrett into the concrete and beating him senseless with nearly every weapon in sight, he still continued to kick out every time I pinned him, time and time again. Now I'm all for a challenge, but having your opponent no-sell your attacks isn't a challenge, it's just annoying. The thing that really turns me away from the gameplay is the cheesy effects added to it. If you ever low blown an opponent, you'll be met with a cheesy boink sound effect or whistle sound effect. Like why? Just why? And of course, to call the action for WCW's last video game is Tony Schiavone and Bobby Heenan.

Overall: For WCW's final video game, this wasn't all it could've been. Somewhere, some genius back in 2000 thought it'd be a great idea to completely toss out the wrestling ring and have nothing but backstage fighting. While on paper it may have sounded like a good idea, actually going through with it was a mistake as fighting backstage in every match gets old really quick. Kind of like most things on WCW television during the time this game came out, Backstage Assault took something cool and ran it into the ground until the point it was no longer something interesting or fun. Had they kept the in-ring aspect in this game and worked on adding other features, then this could've been a really great game. Something not many know is that a follow up to Backstage Assault was being planned but it would be called Mayhem 2. So it was ultimately a sequel to Mayhem but had the same concept as Backstage Assault. Set for a Playstation 2 release in October 2001, it looked to be the greatest WCW game never made. Mayhem 2 would still take place backstage, but with a Def Jam like theme with bigger and larger areas to fight in and even a story mode with branching stories. Unfortunately because WCW went out of business in March 2001, the game never made it past its early developing stage. Instead, we're left with this average, somewhat forgettable game that is Backstage Assault to put the exclamation point on WCW's video games. Overall, Backstage Assault is a decent game. It's fun to finally get to play as the women of WCW as well as play as a lot of the popular stars that were in WCW during that time, but after 7 or 8 matches, the game loses its flavor and becomes bland and lackadaisical. If you're a big fan of WCW and/or its video games, then give this a try; otherwise, just settle for Smackdown 2 Know Your Role--which outshone this game when it came out just weeks after Backstage Assault",Decent End To WCW's Video Game History,1440720000,,,

3.0,False,"01 8, 2012",A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B000FJEV06,Mike London,"""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" were a hot property back in the late 1980s.  They had spawned a successful comic book series, a television show, three feature length movies, and other related merchandise.  They were even featured in Pizza Hut advertisements.

So it was natural someone would feature them in a NES game.

Enter Ultra, a shadow company of Konami.  Ultra was a subsidary of Konami and created for the sole purpose of publishing more NES titles than Nintendo allowed a developer to publish in any given year.

There was already an arcade game as a four player beat'em up released in Japan when Ultra released TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  in North America.  Rather than do a port of that title, Ultra developed their own title.  The arcade port would be released as TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  II: The Arcade Game.  Although billed as a sequel, the port of the arcade title had nothing to do with the original NES game, and had much different gameplay.  Instead of four player, the NES TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  II had two player.  Otherwise the game as largely identical to the original arcade title.

The game proved very popular back in the day.  This video game would even appear in the 1989 NES commercial posing as a feature length Hollywood film called THE WIZARD. (Interestingly enough, Lucas (""I love the Power Glove.  It is so bad!"") is now a convicted felon due to sex crimes.)  It's great to hear Beau Bridges complain about the Technodrome!  It's even better to read Roger Ebert's review of THE WIZARD where he discusses the games as well.

The overall gamestyle is either top down perspective or sidescrolling, and this title uses both constantly and interchangeably, similar to ZELDA II, although there is more to do in the overworld perspective than ZELDA II..

The game features all four turtles as playable characters from the start.  You are able to switch out any turtle at any time (provided they are still alive and have energy).  Leonardo has medium range sword attacks.  Raphael has the worst attack range but has the very powerful attack.  Michelangelo has medium range and power but is the fastest turtle (and the best to use in the infamous water stage).  Donatello is by far the best turtle to use due to his attack range and power, almost making the other three turtles obsolete at best.

Like previous reviewers have noted, the game strangely lacks any major enemy characters from the franchise, which is a rather strange omission given the fact Konami was marketing this product and kids obsessed with the turtles.  For bosses, Bebop, Rockseady, Turtle Van, Blimp, the Technodrome, and Shredder are the only main characters from the franchise that make an appearance.  Where is Krang (my personal favorite), Leatherhead, the Rat King, Casey Jones, etc?  Nowhere to be found.

The game overall is short and brutal.  You only get three continues.  There are only six (long stages), but trust me, those stages will have you pulling your hair out at the end.  Although there have been complaints about the controls, they are not THAT bad.  The Angry Video Game Nerd has shown in his famous review of this title a spot where you must jump over a certain hole in the floor that you actually just run over.  That is the exception, though, not the rule.  Overall the play control is rather good.

Like several NES games, ""TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES "" features a stage notorious for its difficulty.  ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is rather infamous for the water stage where you must guide the turtles through an insanely challenging swimming level where you must disarm explosives before the bad guys blow up a dam. TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  gives you 2:20 minutes to swim through this underwater labyrinth in an attempt to disarm the bombs. You must avoid water currents, electric beams, pink seaweed that is very difficult to avoid.  Other stages that are difficult are Stage Four, the spiked wall sequence, and the final boss.

The difficulty and the length of this game was in line with other titles and these features were rather common in that era.  Other famous difficult levels from the NES era are 8-3 from the original ""Adventure Island"", the ""Battletoads'"" racing level and snakes level, ""Ninja Gaidens"" 6-2 and beyond, and the Yellow Devil boss from the original ""Mega Man"".  The games were just hard as balls back then and short.  The length was due largely to the technology of the time

The reviewer who complained about the ending being ""the worst"" he has ever seen is rather laughable.  It is a NES game, after all.  Overall, the endings to NES titles were always rather lame.  As far as the ""worst"", I would probably nominate GHOST AND GOBLINS, because after beating the game, you discover you have literally been tricked by Satan (!), and the only way to see the ""true"" ending is to go back and beat the game a second time.  As that game is damn near impossible, this ending just adds insult too injury.  How Capcom ever got Satan past Nintedo's censors (who wanted all religious content removed from North American NES video games)  I guess we'll never know.  Shigeru Miyamoto's 1983 DEVIL WORLD even went unreleased in the United States due to the title.

For availability, obviously you can get the game used for your NES or emulate (which may be safer for your controller, as you can save state your way through the more difficult sections).  Nintendo also sanctioned the title's rerelease in the Wii's Virtual Console (the greatest invention in the history of mankind, if I do say so myself!), although TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  is 600 points rather than the standard 500 points for NES titles due to licensing issues.

Although now in the twenty plus years the game has been out, it has become favorable to blast the game for its difficulty and other perceived offenses (largely due to the AVGN review), it helps to remember that TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES sold over four million copies when first released, making it one of the most successful third party NES titles ever.  Nintendo Power gave this game their Game of the Year award in 1989 as well.

Much like ZELDA II: THE ADVENTURE OF LINK, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES was a tremendously popular game, and much of the hostility present toward the title in the present gaming culture was not present back in the late 1980s (though this is probably more true of ZELDA II than TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES ).

Although difficult and sometimes frustrating, this is one of the great NES titles.  The video game website IGN rated this title as the 98th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.","Three Stars - Tremendously popular when released, still good today",1325980800,7,,

3.0,False,"01 24, 2008",A5CWLQF6QO3CN,B000G77X34,Tso Haven Hei Wan,"It is not hard to find the blatant similarities between Rogue Galaxly and Final Fantasy XII - both boasted huge universe to explore and quick pace action in a traditional RPG setting. However, Rogue Galaxy was more than that - it further include elements like Pokemon, Skies of Arcadia, Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts. All those similarities could have made it a great game if mastered skilfully but Rogue Galaxy failed to accomplish that.

The game started off pretty well. However, once it introduced its Revelation system, it is not hard to link this with FF XII's License Board. However, there was enhancement - you can deploy your new skills immediately without saving up more cash to buy it, which is a huge improvement. Then later you have the Insector side quest, which basically is extremely similar to Monster Hunter and probably more so for Pokemon. This is when you start think of how much originality does the game have?

Space pirate RPGs - the most two notable ones are FF XII and Skies of Arcadia. Hm bounty hunting? Both checked for the other two games. A central hero looking for expansion of horizon in the starry oceans? Hm checked for both other games. Low HP with levelling up but huge damage from random enemies...hm not quite so for the other two games but wait, isn't that Dragon Quest (also by Level 5)? Change of costume...that sounds like an expansion of Dragon Quest (anybody remember Jessica's outfits?). Factory fusing new items and then available for sale - sounds like a mix of Dragon Quest's alchemy pot plus FF XII selling hard to find items to lure new items out from shops.

So what's left of the game in terms of originality...really not much. It still could be a good game if those aspects were exercised skilfully. However, there are quite a number of annoying factors that really taxed your game experience. For example, low HP but huge damage will only work in turn based RPG cos you can employ strategies but in an action battle system, all you can do is to use up your potions and resurrection items cos before you know, two hits your character is dead. Also there is no healing spells and resurrection spells. So stocking up healing items is essential cos you party can get wiped out in 2 seconds if you are not paying enough attention.

Another annoying aspect is the shifting of sub-weapons whenever you encounter enemies with force field barriers. This is especially annoying when you want to level up your new sub weapon only to find out that you have to switch back to yoru barrier break weapon which only does 0 damage and will run out of bullets in 4 shots. So if you missed, you have to wait for 10 minutes before it is recharged and by that time you'd have used up most of your healing items to keep your party alive because of continuous pounding from the invincible enemies.

Also there are a lot of useless characters that look tough but that's all. This is especially for the Deego dog. I think a chiwahwah can fight even better than he does. He is slow and low in defense. Two hit he is dead and sometimes you just want to leave him lying there dead to save up your healing items. And all those shouting and yelling during battles by different characters are particularly annoying. Especially when you need to craw through a long dungeon. They keep on yelling ""Jaster!"". You can turn off the chatting in the dungeon but not during battles. And also there are characters that if you want a good challenge, use them as your controlled character - Yes I'm talking about Simon, who only do 2 hits and then it runs out of action point and just need to stand there all the time.

Crawling dungeons is another hassle. They are long! Ok long dungeon is still ok but they recycle the polygons so much that you can only note the difference in areas by their colours and sometimes you don't even know what you are doing. You just feel like you are running in circles and then suddenly a new save point shows up and you know you are in a new area. The Twin Tower is the worst because after you finished the first one like after 10 hours of running around, you'll need to do it again to clear it another to move on. When you are looking at the same polygons again and again for 60 hours, the beauty becomes a nuisance.

However, although there were so many flaws in the game, the graphics were pretty (except for the dumb look of the lead character), the cut scenes were well done and the music was good. They can be said as the saving grace of the game, but still the flaws overshadowed the good parts of the game.

If you haven't played a Castlevania game before, the basic premise of the game is that every once in a while Dracula comes back from destruction in an effort to enslave the souls of man into dark servitude.  The player explores Dracula's castle, gains levels, finds lots of loot, learns spells, and generally trashes Dracula's well thought out plans.  Much like the Metroid series, backtracking to old regions is an important aspect of the game as you gain new abilities that increase you're character's mobility and lethality.

This iteration of Castlevania has done away with some sacred cows of the Castlevania legend.  You don't play a Belmont, you don't use a whip, and you aren't Alucard (Dracula's half-human son, for the uninitiated).  For the first half of the game you don't even spend any time in Dracula's castle.  You will explore light houses, forests, ocean reefs, and rescue the residents of a small village for about half of the maps.  This is different and generally works well.  Instead of equipping weapons, this iteration of the game utilizes a ""magic-only"" concept and your character equips glyphs... which mostly act exactly like weapons in previous games.  A large number of the enemies have received graphical facelifts, which is nice and I've seen a large number of creatures that are completely new to the game.

WHAT'S DEVILISHLY GOOD ABOUT ECCLESIA?
+++ The graphics and art-style are excellent.
+++ Stepping outside of the castle is good, but there are issues.
+++ Monster redesigns are excellent and the new animations feel fresh.
+++ The music is very good
+++ Gameplay mechanics have changed.  The new glyph system takes some adjustment, but it is different from previous iterations of the game and works well.
+++ Villagers give you optional mini-missions, which is a nice bonus that extends the play.  I wish there were more of these.
+++ The last half of the game is very excellent, so good that the first half is worthwhile.

WHAT SUCKS THE LIFE OUT OF THIS GAME?
--- The first half of the game is no where near as good as the last half.
--- The learning curve on this game is completely out of whack and unbalanced in the first half of the game.
--- While the music is good, most other Castlevanias have done better.  As a fan of the series, I was let down by my high expectations of superior tunes.
--- Inventory feels more limited than previous games and provides fewer options.

Dare I say it, this Castlevania possibly possesses the best 2D art (mixed with some 3D effects) the series has seen.  Graphically, I think Symphony of the Night was finally surpassed, but only because the art looks crisper and sharper.  The downside is that some of these gorgeous backgrounds are little over-used so some areas give the player too much of a sense of deja vu.  More variety from screen to screen would have been nice.  The storyline is presented stiffly and painfully, full of cliches common to video games.  There is some very limited voice acting, and it is at its best, mediocre; at its worst, embarrassingly bad.  But no one plays Castlevania for the story.  We know the story... Dracula is bad and he must be stopped.  We play the game to explore and experience awesome classic 2D gameplay.

My biggest complaint probably won't bother hardcore fans of the Castlevania series, but I think the unbalanced difficulty level in the first half of the game could turn a lot of semi-casual players off from this game.  It almost feels like some really tough monsters were randomly tossed into early parts of the game without recognizing that the character would only have a handful of levels and a lot of weak weapons and spells.  To top it off, a few boss fights feel downright cheap and unfair in the first half of the game.  I think the first 30% of the game is more immensely more difficult than the later sections, and in some cases just switching the play order of the different zones would fix most of these issues.  My girlfriend loved the first two DS Castlevania games.  She's just a casual gamer and focuses on if a game is fun.  The first two DS Castlevanias had a smoother learning curve and eased new players into the franchise, but I know this game will frustrate her and it isn't likely she will try to complete this version.

All in all, I recommend this game to all Castlevania fans.  To newcomers, I recommend playing through at least one of the other DS Castlevanias first (I recommend Portrait of Ruin personally).

I bought this one about 2 weeks ago and I've been playing it a lot.  There is so much to do!  It is so much more addicting than the other 2 I've played.

The downside - and it is a major problem - is the glitches.  I've had the game freeze on me several times.  One of the latest freezes was when I just tried to talk to a character in the game, and instead of the touch screen showing him, it showed a toddler (what I assume would be the main character's future child - looked like the child in AWL) then froze.  So I restarted from my last save and just didn't talk to that character, no problem.  But then, I decided to save and quit, and the next time I wanted to load the game... nothing.  The load screen gets all jumbled up and freezes.  Now I will have to start over!

It is a very fun game, but some testing should have come across these issues!  Game freezes are annoying, but saved data corruption is just painfully frustrating!!

Saving.
I thought we were pass the era of gaming were you couldn't save anywhere you want - or worst yet, save period. Some of the levels on this game are pretty intense, and are long - but EA for whatever god-forsaken reason, decided to be an absolute a**hole and NOT put ""save anywhere"" function (like 99% of PC games have)  on the PC version.
There is nothing more anoying then getting 20 min into a level, only to die and start ALLLL the way back from the begining. The results? Only to get back where you were to die AGAIN. How lame is that? A reviewer said it earlier: The saving system in this game is a shame. A damn joke. A teaser.
Not only that, but I have been screwed by bugs more then once in this game. One time, during a cut-scence on the level Southern Gate (the Kings path) it showed the big elephant comming towards me (this is all a cutscene) and for whatever reason, it glitched there - the cutscene kept going, but I was never able to return to my character - I had to actually exit out, and re-do the ENTIRE freaking level, only to have it happen AGAIN! ARGG! Absolutely rediculous.
There is no excuse for crap like that. It wouldn't bother me so much if I were able to save right before it - but since you have to re-do the entire level, its' just outright abnoxious.
On the plus side - the game IS fun, and the mindless ""bashing a million orcs"" can set the mood if you just want some quick action. The coolest part about this game is probably just the sheer number of enemies on your screen when your battling. It's like Serious Sam, only in 3rd person.
But because the gameplay is so easy and brainless, you do have to take a break every 15 min.
The graphics are pretty good. The character details and lighting is above average. The sound is also good. The enviroments and levels could use alittle more help, but it's not bad at all really.

It came on the heels of one of the best in the series, ""Super CV 4"", and was ported from Japan from a much superior version of the same game.

Unfortunately the game fails as a follow-up to SCV4 as well as a weak version of the japanese title. It suffers many setbacks from the game that came directly before it- whip control is now much more basic, and the levels are a lot more basic, washed out, and awkward- the main character doesn't move the way we'd expect and the character sprites are just different.

Some of the great system-showcasing effects from CV4 were left behind as well. Scaling, rotation, and other fancy effects aren't really displayed here. Instead it's a pretty straightforward side-scrolling actioner without many frills.

All this would be fine if the gameplay was good, but that too is just average. As mentioned, gameplay just doesn't have the same Castlevania ""feel"" as far as gravity, speed, and so on. And while the graphics are pretty, it just isn't as fleshed out and impressive as most other Castlevania offerings. The music itself is also only fair- while there's a familiar tune here and there, and it is done well, it just isn't a new palate of instant soundtrack classics. Add to this the fact that the game gets somewhat difficult and cheap in later levels, and it amounts to a pretty shallow experience.

Compared to other Castlevanias (especially the japanese game this was based on), it fails to live up. Castlevania has always been a choice franchise, and this is one of its weakest offerings. As a standard action game, it's not bad- the game definitely doesn't just flat-out suck. But be warned, it's a very washed out experience if you're looking for the next great Castlevania.

I would recommend this to a PC/Mac user due to the ease of hooking it up but for a console user looking for surround sound options, I just don't see this making much sense as a purchase.",Maybe I'm just missing the point,1326153600,7,,

Overall, it is a lot of fun and it works amazingly well.  It is a game, not meant to replace a workout at the gym.  Having said that, it is a great way to work in some fun exercise without it seeming like exercise.

I'm not going to give a detailed report - I'd just like to point out what I see as a big flaw.  As I said, I would buy the game again.  What would make me rate it a 5 star??  Getting rid of the beginning screen where the Wii Fit does it measurements and progress.  My son is a big kid built like a linebacker, but far from a candidate for ""The Biggest Loser"".  Each time he signs in he is informed ""that's obese"".  I have to reinforce to him that he's not obese and to ignore the game...we are just playing for fun.  Once we get past that, it is a lot of fun.  The kids like to try to beat my high score in the aerobics games & they are getting pretty good!  They are great at the balance games and find it extremely satisfying that they can beat me.

My point...this is supposed to be a fun game.  Why not make the negative comments in a file where you can look for them if you'd like.

One more note.  I haven't found a need for any of the accessories.  I already have an exercise mat and there's no need to buy the Wii one.  We wear socks when playing, so no need for the silicone cover.  Battery life after 1 month and lots of play time hasn't been an issue.","Great fun, but it has a few negatives",1220572800,8,,

The Bad: Repetitive NPCs, voices, and music, bad graphics, stiff animations, everything is useless outside classes and main missions, linear, only two vehicles to ride, low sound quality, lame dating system

Everyone was bullied at some point in their life during school, so Rockstar took it upon them to help people reflect on that and become a bully themselves or an anti-bully. Jimmy Hopkins is sent to Bullworth Academy because he's a huge jerk and his mom and step-dad hate him. The story really makes you reminisce about high-school because of how accurately it portrays it. You walk around and you see jocks beating up nerds and greasers beating up preps. Of course due to the game's age (about 7 years old) comes problems, glitches, and stiffness due to the PS2's limited technology, but the overall atmosphere and fun content will keep you hooked.

The game is based of off Grand Theft Auto so if you play that series a lot you are right at home here. You get a mini-map with stars marked on them, combat system, vehicle system, as well as a shooting system. They all work really well and even better than the GTA games, but don't forget this is a Teen rated game so you can forget about Jimmy killing hookers and pushing drugs. After you get familiar with the engine you will get introduced to the combat system which works well thanks to a lock-on mode and target switching with the right analog stick (keyboard controls suck). A health bar is displayed around the target's feet and the melee combat system is surprisingly deep. You unlock combos and moves by bringing transistors to the bum that lives behind the school.

With grapples, take downs, and various combos comes ranged combat which is fun thanks to the interesting and fun weapons. Instead of rocket launchers and AK-47s we get potato spud launchers, bottle rocket launchers, slingshots, stink bombs, itching powder, spray paint (for tagging), eggs, and various breakable melee weapons that are awesome to use. You can't jack cars, but you can jack bicycles and you have a skateboard in your inventory. I really wish there were more vehicles to use than just these two things, but it works because the world isn't big enough to need anything faster.

The days in Bully go by like school and of course you can get busted, and instead of wasted, knocked out like in GTA games. Prefects are the authority on campus and there are a lot of rules. There are two classes a day and you will see a bell on your map and if you are skipping class you can be busted for truancy, hit kids and you get chased for violence, hit girls or adults and the meter goes red and everyone runs after you for this. You can be busted for trespassing (being inside a building after hours), theft, vandalism, and all the hijinks of kids so watch out. Of course getting busted is actually hard because you can always outrun them and if a prefect gets a hold of you can you rapidly press Y to break free, but if a teacher or cop gets you you're done.

Classes are fun and consist of mini-games like music class uses the triggers to tap out rhythm, biology has you dissecting animals, math class has you answering simple questions, shop class has you doing button commands to repair bikes, and photography class has you snapping pictures. There are more classes and they help keep you busy between missions and can be fun. When you aren't doing missions or classes you can do one of the two jobs in town which is a paper route and moving lawns. I really wish there were more jobs, but more on why later. There are also challenges for each faction as well as random activities like people have you egg things, make delivers, or break into lockers.

Missions are varied and range from throwing snow-balls, playing tricks, assaulting faction fortresses, sneaking through an asylum, helping teachers with adult problems. There's a lot of variety in the main missions and it will keep you hooked and wanting to do the next one. I just wish there were more side missions that had a good pay off because money is kind of useless in the this game. I rarely spent it and didn't really need to. There is also a lame dating system built-in where you can compliment a girl, then give her a gift, then she'll kiss you. This is as far as it goes and after trying it once you won't do it again.

All this sounds fun, and is, but it comes with a price of age. Everything feels stiff, stilted, and linear which really detracts from the experience. The same NPCs walk around and sayings repeat constantly, animations are stiff and awkward, the same music repeats constantly, the sound is low quality, and the graphics aged poorly with low poly models, and some ugly textures. The only things that hasn't aged is the excellent voice acting, memorable characters, and charming and witty dialog. This is the best part about Bully because of characters like Gary who are whacked out sociopath who you want to just punch. The world isn't very big at all, and while you can change your clothes, hair, and earn money there's really no reason for it. You can find collectibles in the world, do races, and more, but honestly for what? There's no pay off and I guess you just do it to be a completionist a best.

I could go on about how stiff the game feels or the multiple glitches that I encountered, but after completing the 10-15 hour campaign I felt no reason to continue on. I couldn't bear hearing the same saying, listening to the same music, or seeing the same NPC walk by me. Back in the day it was revolutionary, but not its just a wrinkle in the game time line as something unique and playful because there isn't a single game out there like it. Enjoy the game for the great dialog, characters, and story, as well as the fun mini-games and varied missions, but if you can't overlook the many faults then move on.",Despite feeling so dated there is some fun here,1332892800,2,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

The LED problem is there right now I have a total of five LEDs not working on various keys. I don't run them all the time nor do I use anything brighter than the lowest setting, take what you like from that. The first one went out not too long after the warranty period ended (of course!).

The software isn't all that friendly. I'll grant that it works as intended, for the most part, you will likely have to do some research into the Corsair way of doing things. I'm running this on an i7 machine with Windows 8. The keyboard will periodically refuse to come up when you boot up the PC. This didn't start until after the warranty periodic expired as well. Shutting down the PC, unplugging the USB cable and reseating it as never failed to correct this issue, again take what you will from this. The keyboard has never stopped working during a session once booted however.

The keys work very well. The media functions work well. The USB port on the keyboard is quite handy and I use it often. The keyboard is loud enough to become an irritant at times. I did install O rings on the keys about 3-4 months in and that greatly improved the noise issue with no ill effects on usability. The spacebar is the only key I have a real issue with, it would have been nice if they'd used dual switches rather than taking the less expensive single switch. This means now and then you have to hit the spacebar twice if you don't get a solid strike on it. If you're into games as I am this in annoying.

The Corsair K95 replaced a Logitech G15 that I used (heavily) for maybe 7 years or longer, no LEDs out I might add. While I like the mechanical keys better than the setup on the G15, Logitech's software is leagues ahead of Corsair's and much friendlier. At the current rate of LED blackouts on the K95 I would estimate 35-40 LEDs out by the time this keyboard is 7 years old. Overall I like the keys but that's Cherry not Corsair, you can get any number of ""Cherry"" equipped mechanical keyboards. The keyboard housing being aluminum, I think you'd have to purposely try and damage it, it's not going to break easily. The software.....well, leaves much to be desired.

Would I recommend this keyboard to a friend? No, not for $130.00 or more I can't recommend it to anyone, there are better alternatives out there. The K95 isn't a bad keyboard, it just isn't a great keyboard, the best rating I could give after eleven plus months is ""meh"".","After 11 months of ownership, Meh, is the best I can give it.",1409961600,,,

I have been a huge advocate of the Playstation for the last 2 decades, and have been in love with the games and systems for what feels like forever. One of the biggest selling points of the new systems has been the backward compatability. I still have PS1 games that I love to play. The PS3 supposedly had good backward compatability, allowing me to continue to play my PS1 and PS2 games. I have been disappointed with the reality of the software. PS3 games are awesome; graphics, storylines and all, but,I have not been able to play several of my PS2 games, and this has downgraded how much I like the system. With the amount of time that Sony had to create the PS3, they should have made it backward compatable with all of their previous games, and not have 'patches' or 'updates' to hopefully allow an earlier game to play.

3.0,False,"04 2, 2002",ATL84JW0KKIMJ,B00005TPTC,Jeffrey R. Tilley Jr.,"Being a big UFC fan, and having dabbled with martial arts and ground-fighting in the past, I was looking forward to this Xbox title above all others.  The screeenshots looked great, and the official web page sent me into a frenzy.  I never owned a Dreamcast, but I have friends who loved that version, and others that loathed the Playstation edition.  I was hoping that the designers had ironed out any bugs from those installments and the Xbox would provide a better system to present the complexities of true NHB, mixed martial arts fighting.
Unfortunately, after the long wait, it could not live up to my high expectations.  While the designers have done a great job making the fighters look like their real-world counterparts, they could have done a better job on the shading  and textures.  All the graphics look a little unfinished to me, and when the action gets fast, they can get really glitchy.  I've noticed that when throwing punches and kicks, the fighters tend to flicker or blink.  Once you notice it, it becomes hard to ignore and very irritating.
The gameplay is a little lopsided as well and it's far more strike-oriented than I'd like.  In the arcade mode the first night I owned the game, I got 47 victories in a row using Tito Ortis and all I had to do was punch, punch, punch.  I liked the ground-fighting a lot more (which isn't surprising for those who know me) but victory seems to have a lot more to do with chance than skill.  While I really liked the realistic submissions and takedowns, most of the grappling is clunky and not very fluid at all. It seems that they have a ways to go before they can really simulate the feel and flow of this type of fighting.
It's not all bad though.  I really liked the create your own fighter feature.  I was disappointed that Royce Gracie wasn't in the game, so I made my own version of him.  There are lots of different advantages you can use to specialize your fighter, and several different fighting styles.  On the down side, I wanted to create Tank Abbot, but the game doesn't seem to offer a model for the less ""defined"" body types.  Seems sort of unfair.  I was hoping the unlocked characters would be actual fighters, but most of them turned out to be fictional characters more at home in a ""Street Fighter"" game than the UFC.  The two exceptions are referee John McCarthy and, my personal favorite Ice T.  Yes, that Ice T.  I got a good chuckle out of that one.
So far the big saving grace of the game is playing with a friend.  I played it for a couple of days alone and was very disappointed.  When a buddy came over and we started playing it, I warmed up to the game considerably.  The AI is nothing compared to a real person, which is true of most games. This game is a great distration and the quickness of the matches is nice when you don't have time to get into something long-term like NFL fever or Halo. It's a pleasant distraction.
I would suggest to anyone looking to buy this game: rent it first.  It has it's high points, and big UFC fans will undoubtedly be interested, but the flaws are not easily ignored.",Somewhere in the middle.,1017705600,,,
3.0,False,"10 20, 2014",A2171ZGKU3SFDD,B002I096Q4,The Rev,"Destiny is like a bag of chips, it tastes good but it's bad for you. Destiny is fun, but I was really let down on a good portion of this game.

Cons:
- Story, what is it exactly? Who are these guys, why am I killing them? All you get is, ""the story is too long to tell, so here you go into the world..."". It seems as if it's made for dlc to expand it as there's no climax, ending, what so ever, the plot is just so lacking. This is due I guess to the writer changes at Bungie so they had to scrap everything. Overall, I expected better from Bungie as I know they can write better stories.

- Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive... did I get your attention on repetitive it is? Missions, start at the same point on every planet, while going through maybe a part of the previous level you already ran through and then kill the same 3-4 enemies you've already killed hundreds of times, in later levels you just sprint through the whole level because enemies they don't give enough exp. Once at the end of the level, upload your ghost, and then fight waves of enemies til your ghost finishes while not helping, over and over again. Same goes for Strikes, w/out bounties, it's the same Strike boss over and over, w/ bounty, it goes up to about 3.

- Endgame: Bungie, ""The game will totally change after lvl20!"". Yea sure... except waay more monotonous grinding for the 5% chance you're gonna get a rare/legendary loot item to lvl up, oh boy! Sub-lvl 20 is a more fun than after lvl 20. Post-lvl 20 you'll want to start farming chests and other farm runs, so you'll see 20 plus lvl people running a chest farming circuit as chests will randomly spawn in certain spots so you'll see people going room to room looking for chests as it's the fastest way to get gear.

- Loot system: Where's the loot? Uncommon (although not very common) until about lvl10 won't be better than what you have, rare/legendary almost never drops, aaand sometimes aren't even better than what you have. Rare/legendary items are what they are, they should Always be better than what you have.

- Game is EMPTY. Most amount of people you'll see is in the main hub which is about 10, in level, I've seen 4 max, sometimes game is completely empty. The other problem is NOBODY joins your party, the game is lot more fun when you play w/ others but no one joins you! In the entirety of playing this game I had like a total of 3 people play w/ me.

- Public Events: Disappointing, I distinctly remember the E3 gameplay where 5-10 players joined up, NEVER happened to me! I'm claiming false advertising against Bungie. Nothing like this, I had 1, ONE person join me, Max on PE's. They're also pretty repetitive and not that fun.

- Constant disappearing of waypoint marker, you constantly need to hit the thumbstick to bring up the waypoint marker, why doesn't it just stay active?

- No party match for daily/weekly Strike, it says xbox live gold required like the other Strike missions so you'd assume you'd be partying up, but nope.

Pros:
- Backdrops, planets, all look incredible, seeing auroras, satellites, and a giant moon hanging over the hub just look great and you think you're on (or wish) another planet. Planets are very well designed, each planet looks like it should, great visuals, and it's a joy to be on the planets.

- Music: Again very well done, gets you pumped up before a battle, and just good background music.

- Graphics, for the 360, this game has pretty great graphics, especially for a game this size, looks better than much smaller games I've played and just as good or better than other big 360 games. Graphics should not be looked down upon if choosing a version to play.

- Menu!: Menu! LOVE the ""mouse"" free moving type of cursor instead of menu button choosing, if done right the cursor can be really nice w/ a thumbstick and it was refreshing to use, also gave the game an identity of being a more modern type of game. Wish more games had menus like this.

- Shooting/rpg aspects really well done, loved seeing the numbers pop off enemies as you shoot them, lvl'ing up upgrades well done, seeing the exp. bar at the bottom, all felt rewarding.

- Strikes: As they're the ONLY mission where you're forced to play w/ others.

Overall:
Sure the game is fun, but the repetitiveness, non-existent story, and emptiness just kills this game. I was disappointed, I was also falsely advertised to. I would recommend this game if you're looking for something to play, overall it's just not a good game, it's overhyped, disappointing, and it's just not a game that especially Bungie fans like myself expected. I would also recommend playing until lvl 20 and then quitting, there's nothing post-lvl 20 that's worth it, unless you don't mind monotonous grinding, Really want to get through Vault of Glass, and get that final achievement.

3.0,False,"09 11, 2006",ABCKTG6GQUSNU,B0009R1SRI,Lord Kayoss,"I am an old school football purist who appreciates realistic simulations like NCAA & Madden.  I usually don't pay any attention to arcade style games like NFL Street, etc. mainly due to the mindless silliness and unrealistic gameplay that turn football fans like me off.  But, Blitz has always been an amusing detour if you need a timeout from the real gridiron so here's a nice review for those of you who fancy the idea at giving this one a look.

This latest PS2 version definitely has it's entertaining moments, from the storyline cut scenes in ""Campaign"" mode to the brash obscenities the players shout at each other between plays on the field.  Fans of the older games need to take note that this isn't NFL Blitz.  There are no National Football League teams/players/commentators in this one hence the subtitle ""The League"".  Blitz has evolved into a strand-alone football game with it's own fantasy teams and players.  The game really captures your interest in ""Campaign"" mode as you basically begin with watching your team get decimated at the previous season's end and shoved into division 3 as the franchise owner demands redemption.  You customize your team by picking a city, stadium, coaches, team name, uniforms, equipment, etc.  Once you're prepared you hit the field and begin your quest to get back into the limelight and out of the laughing stock of the league.

During actual gameplay, fans of the older Blitz games should feel right at home.  The main play control engine follows the same basics as before, but with added modes like ""Clash"" and ""Unleash"".  Engaging your ""Clash"" energy (by holding down L2) while on defense gives you an added striking capability where you can perform a ""dirty hit"" to force fumbles and injuries where you actually get to see the bones(s) break.  And if one of your players goes down you'll usually have two options of either treating the wound normally which will sideline your player the longest, whether it be for several quarters or full games.  Your other choice is to ""juice"" which will give your trainer permission to give your player an illegal injection to get you back in the game almost immediately.  But be careful!  Get caught juicing and you'll face fines and sanctions.  Using ""Clash"" on offense gives your QB added passing strength/accuracy as well as increasing the chance of your receiver catching a clutch throw.  ""Clash"" can also help your running back avoid tackles by stiff-arming and spinning.

Then, there's ""Unleash"" which occurs when you have 6 ""clash"" icons built up.  ""Unleash"" is a major adrenaline boost that gives the user the maximum amount of momentum and maximizes the likelihood of successfully completing a play.

Also, using ""Clash"" & ""Unleash"" will contribute to ""dirty hits"", which will eventually lead to a brawl where an all-out melee occurs and the two teams knock the crap out of each other for about 10 seconds to see who can build up ""late hits.""

I have to touch on the language.  Wow, this game is a lot like ""Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas"" with it's realistic jargon whether it be spouted from the players, the coach, owner, or your offensive coordinator who chimes in from the box with his sarcastic comments when he's happy or ticked. You'll even hear the ""F"" word here and there.  Very cool - lol.  And obviously parents, you don't want your kids playing this.  Pay attention to the ""M"" rating on the box.  ""M"" meaning ""for mature audiences.""  It's an adult game, make no mistake.

There are other funny elements of the game like getting the opportunity to buy escort girls to send to the hotel room of the visiting team to ""wear them out"" before the game the next day.  Players get arrested on drug charges and whatnot.  Right now there is a sub-plot going on between one of my players and one of our cheerleaders - lol.  Many aspects of the game are very intriguing and hold your interest to make you want to see what happens next.

Okay, here's the bad part - at least for me.  Again, I'm a purist.  I appreciate the real aspects of the game of football.  Most of the unrealistic/comical parts of Blitz are fun, which is an element that the franchise has thrived on.  But there's one thing about Blitz that has always irked the hell out of me and unfortunately this title is no different.  The cpu keeps track of your progress and responds accordingly.  Like if you intercept a ball and have a chance to go up big, watch your back because almost every single time they'll either force a fumble or pick off one of your passes or worse, injure one of your key players.  If you go up a couple scores your turnover rate drastically increases.  Any time the cpu needs a break in the game, it gets it.  I hate that.  In a real time simulation - if you do what you're supposed to do and perform well out there you'll execute and dispatch the opponent.  You run your offense well and wear down the opponent's defense and vice versa.  And if you screw up and the cpu goes up by a couple scores, you still have a chance to turn things around like in real life if you make the necessary adjustments and play smarter.  In Blitz:  you make one mistake and you could fall behind permanently.  Real football doesn't work that way, unless it's just one of those days when you're not prepared or your opponent just plays a flawless game and out-hustles you.  It's very unrealistic when you're late in the 2nd quarter and are about to score before the clock runs down and get the ball right back in the 2nd half when suddenly the cpu forces a fumble or picks off a wide-open pass, almost every single time.  The same thing applies when you're ahead a couple scores.  The cpu opponent magically transforms into a better team and starts a dramatic comeback, almost every single time.  Challenging yes, but very unrealistic which takes away from the fun of the game and playing the game of football effectively.  It's almost as if the cpu is programmed to apply a cheat code and get you back for beating it's @$$, like a sore loser.  NBA Jam, another Midway game for PS2 is the same way.  That's my only gripe.  Other than that it plays really well and is fun besides getting frustrated over silly cpu momentum.  If you're cool with that you probably won't have any complaints.  And as always, if you get tired of the cpu's ""cheating"" tactics you can always pop your NCAA or Madden back in and go back to work in the real sense.

3.0,True,"10 9, 2005",A13NM1PES9OXVN,B00006IJJK,Kindle Customer,"Metroid Prime is a huge achievement, justifiably praised.  It's beautiful to look at, and for those who like a great Sci-Fi environment (lovingly rendered in almost photographic-quality), as well as having a taste for First-person-shooters (FPSes) you'll have a great time.

With that said, I am in a total minority here, but I just didn't love this game.  I wanted too -- I couldn't wait to play!  But I'm also definitely an adventure gamer, and not a FPS gamer at heart, so maybe that's why (for those of you screaming, ""It's really an adventure game"" I have to disagree -- I've played Halo, and this is definitely an FPS, although with a few adventure/scenery touches here and there).

But it's a gorgeous game and certainly worthwhile to many seeking a great game -- so, just in case it helps, here's my list of pros and cons to help those of you on the fence:

THE GOOD:

* The Heroine and Story -- It's intricate, cool, and intelligently presented -- and with a kick-butt heroine in Samus. There's a haunting quality to the atmosphere of this game -- you really get a sense of entering another world. And the story -- which you glean bit by bit, by scanning your environment, prepares you for a heroic destiny.

* The Beautiful Visuals -- This game is gorgeous to look at, and it's obvious that the makers created every aspect with a lot of care. Look up and watch the raindrops plop onto Samus's visor. Or run through a room of steam and watch the inside of your facemask bead up realistically. Each plant and animal is lovingly rendered, and each world -- from desert ruins to lush jungles, ghostly underwater environments, lava pits, and ice caps, is lovingly and gorgeously presented.

* Gameplay and environment -- There's a massive world to explore here, and much fun to be had.  And learning to use Samus's many tools is surprisingly seamless (although it does get complex by the end).  It's rich, fascinating, and really intelligent -- easily a game spanning dozens of hours for all but the fastest gamers (especially if you go after every additional module or weapon enhancement).

OK, now, THE BAD:

* The endless freaking RETRACING -- The world in Metroid Prime is beautiful, thank goodness, because you will be looking at it over and over again, as you retrace your steps to go back and forth for this or that item, task, or save station.

* The Save Station Format -- The spaces between save stations -- especially as the game progresses and the stakes go up -- seem to increase. They are often really hard to find, and located only after hours (yes, hours) of really tough fights, enemies, bosses, mini-bosses, you name it. I actually spent HOURS trying to get to the next save station in the Phazon Mines, and the game nearly had me throwing things after my seventh failed attempt to reach the next save station (I kept dying right before the door after over an hour of tough fighting, thanks to the diabolical invisible robot sentry on top of zillions of tough enemies).

* The constantly respawning enemies -- I can't tell you how tired I got of walking out of a room, walking back in, and having to face the same stupid enemies I just defeated all over again. Worse yet, as the game progresses, and you defeat more bosses, those same bosses also ""respawn"" in all those old areas you've already been to, so that you are constantly refighting enemies you already beat (and they get tougher and tougher and tougher).  While others posting here say it's ""just a few rooms,"" that's not really accurate -- the respawning applies to almost all rooms, with the exception of a few minor cubbyholes or corridors.

This took a lot of fun out of the game for me, felt repetitive, frustrating, and mean-spirited, and frankly just seemed like a transparent way for the game creators to add some mileage and playing-time to the game. I hated this.  (And wait til you meet those annoying Chozo Ghosts -- who pop up over, and over, and over, and over again in rooms you must revisit -- sigh.)

* The controls -- they're superb, but also pretty complex (and in the heat of battle, finding, ""oh, shoot, I swiveled the controller left-for-the-heat_weapon-when-I-meant-to-go-right-for-my-wave-weapon--!"" etc can get pretty tiresome. By the end of the game, you'll use every single stick or button on your controller.  In some battles, you're so busy switching visors, and switching beam types, while also trying to strafe, jump and look up (in an unusually clunky aspect of the gameplay, Samus cannot simply ""look up"" even at a towering enemy, so this also means that locking onto these enemies is sometimes a real challenge as well).

* The increasingly difficult boss battles -- At first, I really enjoyed the bosses in Metroid Prime, because they were hard but not impossible -- they took smarts as well as just mashing the old A button, really refreshing.  But just after the halfway point, they begin to get so difficult they aren't fun.  It took me an entire day to beat Thardus, the boulder-boss, for instance -- an incredibly frustrating boss to beat.

Also -- another major point of annoyance for me here is that so many of the bigger boss battles are essentially the same:  Hit the creature/pirate etc with some specialized weapon, or wearing some specialized visor to that level, then do it over and over and over and over again. The boss loses a ""piece"" of armor, of rock, or of health -- and then you do it all over again.  And again.  With the boss getting quicker or nastier or tougher all the while.  Until the boss is dead.  I'm sorry, but this got really old with me.  (I got all the way near the end of the game a few days ago, to the Omega Pirate Boss, before I quit after half a dozen attempts and very little forward success. I just wasn't having fun anymore.  And because of the nature of the game, naturally if I ever go back to try to finish, I'll have to replay that whole final section all over again.)

My hope here isn't so much that people listen to my gripes, but that maybe they'll help you figure out if you'll enjoy the game or not. If you are more of an adventure gamer than a combat player, someone who enjoys story, character interaction, with less emphasis on battles, you might try renting Metroid Prime to see if it clicks.

But if you like the FPS viewpoint, lots of smart nimble battling, with the occasional stop for breath in a beautiful if rather lonely universe, then this game is definitely for you.","Tough, Smart, Beautiful (and Frustrating)",1128816000,20,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The A,B,X,Y,L,R, Start and Select buttons worked perfectly, and it did read the cross pad, just not properly.  Instead of registering the cross pad as buttons, it actually registered as a Joystick, not necessarily a problem in and of itself.  The problem came in the fact that the right and down buttons were always active.  A controller at rest on the X or Y axis regitered 1, left and up registered 0, and actually pushing right or down registered a 3.  Traditionally rest should have been 0, left or up should be -1 and right or down should be 1 on the respective axis.  As a result this item is unusable on both ZSNES and SNES9x on which I have tried to use it.

I concede that I may have gotten a bad one, in which case it's just bad QC.  I got mine in a manner that's nonreturnable, so I'm going to open mine up and see if there's any resistors or POTs I can adjust.  This is something I as a tech might be able to do, though unlikely based on most modern manufacturing practices, but something the public at large should not have to deal with.

Additional Edit added after original post.

I've played with this a bit more on other operating systems.  It worked great with Linux.  The above listed screwed up button pressed values are still there, but operating systems other than OS X seem to deal with it better (well - I still haven't tried Windows).  I'm increasing the star rating, but since the X/Y axis readings are still outside the expected norm I'm only increasing it a little.

I currently use a Wireless Logitech PS2 control on my Mac using a Gamecube PS2 XBOX Controller to PC USB Adapter 3in1.  It doesn't get much better than that, the above reviewed adapter is currently sitting on a shelf, but I may utilize it in the future on a MythTV box or something.  Of course I'll probably just stick with PS2 controls and buy more 3in1's.","It worked, but it had a technical issue.",1252540800,9,,

The game has the Toy Box, which is universal and every last figure ever made thus far works there. Ok, great, but its not as large or expansive as the playsets and story free for the most part. The PLAYSETS only allow a set group of figures to work in them, which I find, in a second attempt at this game, appalling. Having played all 3 sets that were released in this wave of 2.0, there is absolutely no ""technical"" reason to limit the ability of these figures to work in any of the 3 sets. So what if cut scenes are missing Donald duck if you happen to be using Donald duck. The characters (except the cars, and even them with some tweaking) would all work in any playset and its absolutely stupid to not allow them somehow (After all they know they can with the crossover characters, but even those are limited??!?)
Come on Disney, you want to market a figure based game, give me a figure based game I can truly use them in other than your putsy 5 minute load time for 5 minutes of game play toy box junk...
Also, the 1.0 playsets (Still being sold right next to 2.0) don't work and takes a keen eye to realize this is pure stupidity. They should have been re-done for 2.0. Or they need to change the way they are marketing this game and releasing it in the future. Skylanders did something similar with Swap Force when they quietly made their ""extra levels"" just a 5 second power boost figure instead. Disney could at least of had the decency to carry over their 1.0 playsets into 2.0 at least once, especially given 2 platforms didn't even have 1.0 so can't use them no matter what...(PS4, XB1)","Good game, but flawed marketing and implimentation",1412640000,11,"{'Edition:': ' Premium Value Pack', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

Though after finishing the game the hard truths that often follow innovation are all to apparent. ME is a decent game with a new and fresh presentation and even (gasp!) a message. Though a wafer thin combat element and sometimes sloppy controls keep the game from getting a higher rating from me.

Mirror's Edge is set in a near utopian future. Crime, poverty and other plagues have been all but eliminated - although with a cost. The freedoms that people enjoyed have been abandoned and a totalitarian big brother has an iron grip on all but a few fringe segments of society. Those that oppose the powers that be communicate through ""Runners"" - a group of disenfranchised youth that scale skyscrapers and stay off the beaten path. In Mirror's Edge you'll control Faith a runner on the mend who suddenly finds herself fighting to free her sister who was framed for murder. Those familiar with Parkour a.k.a. ""the art of moving"" will be right at home with ME. For everyone else think of ME as ""urban running"". Instead of using the streets though, urban runners use the environment around them to find the most efficient path over, under and through the cityscape.

The graphics in Mirror's Edge are clean and efficient though sterile. Although you'll spend the majority your time in and urban setting you never really feel it's believable. The developer, DICE, certainly wanted to convey a sense of sterilization and uniformity in the environment. The use of bleach-white in almost every element of the cityscape is evidence of that. Contrast that with limited areas where bright reds, oranges, blues and greens are used. Unfortunately this sterile environment is what you'll be spending your time looking at. Dull rooftops and cinderblock interiors make up the majority of the game.

Gameplay is where things are interesting. Think First-Person-Shooter without the emphasis on shooting and instead on running. You'll use L1 for jumping and L2 for ducking/sliding. That coupled with your forward momentum will be 90% of the game - running, jumping and sliding. There are enemies and they are armed. Faith has basic melee combat abilities and can instantly disarm and cripple the ""Blues"" (police) as they're referred to in the game by carefully timing a button press. You'll also be able to pick up the guns the police drop and use them against your pursuers. Though it's here that ME really stumbles. Clearly the emphasis of the development went to ""running"" and not to the combat. Though you can melee enemies it's more of a single button mashing affair. Disarming enemies is based on timing and though you're given the ability to slow-down time - call it heightened awareness a.k.a ""bullet-time"" - disarming enemies is often hit-or-miss. Using guns against enemies is unsatisfying for a few reasons. First the weapons are dull and inaccurate. Secondly, enemies take a ridiculous amount of bullets to kill. If I had to use a phrase to describe the combat in ME it would have to be ""tacked-on"".

The music is thankfully very pleasant and understated and I actually found it a highlight of the game. After you finish the game you'll unlock the ability to listen to the entire tracklist through the extras menu which is a nice bonus.

The main story in Mirror's Edge is short - probably 6-8 hours. The game does feature several options to keep playing including speed runs and time trials. Speed runs are all about beating an entire level within a time limit. Time Trails feature parts of levels with checkpoints spread along the way. You can upload your own times and compare against your friends and the rest of the world. Other than that the game features 3 difficulty levels and related trophies for beating the game on different settings.

It would take a really terrible game for me to suggest avoiding it altogether and ME is definitely not a terrible game. Still ME is best left a rental than a purchase in my opinion.

Short.  That's how I would describe this game.  Finished the first run in less than a day.  I remember the Bastion took me about half a week, but if I recall The Bastion had more levels.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I remember spending more time with Bastion than Transistor.  I played Bastion like 3 times in a row.  I don't feel that need with Transistor (even though it does have a New Game+ mode).  I also paid less for Bastion, which in my opinion, was the better game.

Don't get me wrong, I love the art and the music in Transistor.  I could frame the stills in my office, play the soundtrack at work.  Will never stop loving Jen Zee's art or Darren Korb's music.

Transistor follows Bastion in its single-player, linear plot and level advancement.  You are essentially told to go where you must, and unlike in Bastion, you cannot go back to where you have been in Transistor; it is not an open world.  I was fascinated with the gameplay in Transistor where you could pause time and plan your next moves against multiple enemies.  What I found missing in Transistor-- and perhaps it wasn't necessary because the game was relatively easy to finish (unless you had limiters in place)-- were the boosts I had in Bastion from bonus items/different weapons (not to endorse underage drinking but those who've played Bastion know what I mean).  There is no RPG element in Transistor where you gather materials or win them in the bonus rounds to make better weapons/armor/boosts. The myriad of talents you pick up (from dead bodies nonetheless) are fun and you can combine them in any way you want, but they were somewhat limited in scope.  I would have killed for a grenade or turbine or calamity cannon with some of those multiplying monsters (""haircuts"" were annoying).  But I guess that was more where the strategy came in, rather than simple button mashing.

There was also no way to block enemy attacks aside from zipping out of the way.  I found the weapon recharge gauge a little stifling during the planned attack mode so the alternative would just be simple sword swinging and single attacks which do very little harm.  Also if you weren't facing the right way you could get stuck along a wall while trying to ""jaunt"" away from enemies and they attacked your useless butt from behind.

Also, there were no health bottles, gauge bottles, or life points for killing things off. If you died, you lose an ability until the next save point or two.  Then you have to reshuffle your abilities, which was annoying. You could die 4 times without having to restart the level.  The key is not to put your favorite attack in the first slot.

Sadly, there is no interactive backdrop.  Can't break boxes for points.  Can't shop for food/health/weapons/upgrades anywhere.  The only plus with exploring the map was observation points (discovery points for Tales of fans) where the narrator reminisces about the City in the past tense. You automatically get your health back after each fight/battle.  You could level up with the ""tests"" that were available in Bastion as well, but you didn't need to pass them all.  Where I could go around smashing things for hidden stuff in Bastion, the background in Transistor was not really meant to be interacted with.

The storyline was a little light and love story between the heroine and the narrator isn't exactly fleshed out during the game.  In the beginning, for all I knew, the ghost in the sword could have been her stalker who just jumped in front of her to save her life and got his soul trapped in the sword/transistor weapon.  Just like in Bastion, the protagonist is silent (unless you listen to the soundtrack and she's singing -- which is gorgeous--and it's the same singer from Bastion) and the story is told by the dead guy in the sword in a sort of play-by-play as you go.  That means you never get to go into the protagonist's head, never know what drives her.  But, like the Kid in Bastion, you know she is trying to save her world (what's left of it, anyway), and anyone else left alive after some catastrophic event.

Totally loved the voice actor (whom I believe was the narrator in The Bastion) who played the dead guy, and once I realized he actually meant something to the heroine and wasn't just some crazy stalker, he melted my heart every time he said he loved her or encouraged her.

The four big villains of the game were a total letdown.  Two of them you never meet.  Their backstories were in little hints here and there but I had no real idea what the villains were about, nor did I really care.  I was expecting a real challenge from them, but no.  I just had to outsmart them.  Also, as far as I can tell, there is no choice you can make at the end, only one ending where I think the story developers could have created multiple endings.

Don't even get me started on the existential/metaphysical/ontological/transhumanist philosophy behind the ending.  There are entire blogs and Reddit strings dedicated to the ""what the heck just happened?"" ending.

So, overall, while the art and music surpassed the Bastion, it was an even simpler game than the Bastion, one you could easily whip through in half a day and feeling you could have gotten more for your money somewhere else.",Wanted a PS4 just so I could play this game!,1451260800,,,

It took about 20 minutes to install, no glitches or problems noticed, a bit long, but then again I spent more time installing WoW so I cannot complain too much. The task of configuring the mouse to a barely acceptable range was non-trivial, even after dropping video options to the bare minimum I still had a noticeable lag time between mouse movement and screen update (my system is within suggested range for the game). That lag in mouse activity was an annoyance during config and startup, but it turned into a major drag when actually in a scenario. I have played a little with FPS games like Rainbow Six and 1942, and this is the first I have run into this type of problem.

Now, if you can get things configured properly, the visual aspects of the game are up to par, and after a few runs through the training scenario you should have a decent feel for the controls (I'd still keep a reference sheet handy for the first few runs). The play is not all that complex (at least on Easy) and the map view if very helpful when sneaking up on opponents. I cannot comment on the replay value as the control issue kept me from playing through more than the first few scenarios.

Bottom line, this game was not my cup of tea.

The game dragged a lot.  There's  at least a  good 4 hours that could have been trimmed from this experience.  The flashback chapters stand out as those that could have been cut.  Even the opening boat sequence could have been cut.  I literally shook my head when I had to do the Old Lady house in chapter 16 or so.  Shook it as in I can't believe they are making me do this to get to the rest of the game.

They could have summed up the flashback chapters and much of the other story material  with a few lines here and there in a journal or conversation  or text.  Too often this  ""game"" was a slave to the narrative.

Too much climbing.  So much that it got old.  They did add a 2nd climbing mechanic later in the game.  That perked it up again.

Too many fake ""oh you almost fell"" moments. Too many ""let me give you a hand and boost you up"" moments.  The game is so failsafe  that these moments fall on deaf ears and feel fake.

Too much moving of rolling crates to climb higher.  Like a lot of things in this game, they don't build upon the original idea.  They just repeat it.

Sometimes the game goes  ""walk and prompt"" mode.  You walk along a disguised but linear path and then every 5 minutes you get a triangle button prompt.  You press it and get a story bit.  And then walk some more.  Rinse and repeat.  Your character banters with the other characters or talks to himself during this time as well.  I include the first jeep section or two in this category.

Puzzles.  LIke a lot of things in this game, this puzzles are designed to give you a feeling of doing something without actually doing anything.  The puzzles are just a matter of going through the motions.  They might as well have just cut these out too and put them into the same cutscenes where everyone figures out where to go next on the map.

Combat.  I looked forward to these parts so I could sneak up on enemies as much as possible and take them out..  I often wished there was more tall grass because, without it, it was really difficult to sneak up and take out the enemies at least without some serious patience and trial & error.  Other additions like throwing a rock or whistling would have been a good thing to introduce as the game progressed.  Sneaking did may wonder why Drake doesn't carry ninja star or a bow & arrow or a throwing knife or a stun gun.

Firing the guns was fun too.  I did wish the game would have linearized the combat and split it into sections where there is a focus on a particular weapon.  And then at the end have a big arena, anything goes battle or two.  It would have made the combat set pieces stand out a bit more.  And given the player an opportunity to focus on a weapon or two and use it in some fun situations.  The way it is you can do what you want, but there's some trial and error as to what works and what doesn't at any particular time.

The pop and shoot cover mechanic is half fun/ half irritating much like the how the ""game"" itself.  It feels like this mechanic was something that was good 10 years ago, but that it should be better now.  Every time I take cover and then pop out I have no idea where my aim will be except not close to the guy shooting at me.  And you play a mini-game of popping out and to your aim and going back into cover.  You do that 2 or 3 times and then you're ready to pop out and shoot the enemy in the head that is popping out and shooting you.  Unless that enemy decides to move.  Then you have to start this process all over again.  But I liked it for the most part.  I never really felt like I mastered it though.  Or got much better at it.

It's annoying that every enemy takes 5 bullets before dropping.  Enemies, seemingly in t-shirts, are taking 5 bullets.  This stands out in a game that has beautiful  production values.

Grenades are annoying to deal with.  Throwing  them?  I couldn't hit the broadside of a barn with a grenade even after playing the entire game.

But really I'm talking about grenades thrown at your character.  It doesn't feel good to deal with incoming 'nades.  It starts with the fact that I never could see them coming.  I would just see a  'nade icon suddenly appear and Drake would scream out an ""oh no"" or something.  Next, I could really never tell where the 'nade was on the ground.  3rd, Drake is a stiff and it doesn't feel good to get away from nades.  What I would have liked as a player is to more clearly see/hear where a 'nade is coming from, have its position on the ground clearly communicated to me and then be given a crisp/clear/clean/solid/fun way to avoid the grenade if I make the correct choice/move in the correct time.  As the game was I usually just ignored 'nades and took my damage and got back into cover and waited a few seconds to heal.

Combat was the most game part of the ""game.""  And so, for me, was the most fun part of UC4 even after killing legions of bad guys.

The rest of the stuff was mostly brain-dead filler to pace the combat encounters.

Miscellaneous:  The last jeep sequence was fun.  The added climbing mechanic was fun.  The vehicle set piece was fun.  I actually thought the game started way too slow.  The first 5 or 6 chapters were lots of cutscenes and flashback chapters of didn't mean much gameplay.  I guess they used this as a sort of tutorial, but since you did all this stuff 1000x during the game anyway it didn't need these chapters.  The last 3rd of the game went quick contrary to what I heard.  There was too much walking in a part or two.  But otherwise I remember lots of combat and the climbing was the best towards the end.  And the ending was pretty.  The Epilogue was a bore like the Old Lady House. Although the first 5 seconds brought a tear to me eye.

I can't end without mentioning the production values.  I think the production values are the big reason for the super high scores of this game.  It had amazing graphics and voicework and sounds too.  Still I wanted more game out of this ""game.""  It kind of plays itself.",Mixed Bag,1463788800,5,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

What it fails at it everything else. Consider this, SH2 was one of the best games of all time, according to most reviwers, and Konami wants that same success. What to do? Why not make a game like it with a similar story?

So yeah, instead of a greving husband seeking his wife, you play as an amnesiac would-be soldier who treks through his home town of Shepards Glen (Why not Silent HIll?) trying to find his little brother.

SPOILER: The Character of SH2 who sought his wife knew his wife was dead yet she sent a letter telling him to go to Silent HIll. It turns out he killed his wife. Well, SAME FREAKIN' PLOT TWIST! Yeah, older brother killed little brother Josh accidently and thus ruined some hokey religous sacrifise thing done to keep Silent Hill from Silent Hill-ing the nearby town of SHepards Glen.

The gameplay is fair, having a half-decent combat mode for your character. You have a dialog selection that usualy does nothing to the ending of the game, five or six people wandering the otherwise desolate town, and a brief reference to Piramid Head from SH2 (Seriously, he might as well have danced for us for all the good he did for the story). YOu would think that the game would be good right?

Well, HA-HA! No... it stinks to high heaven. It just does not feel like Silent HIll. It feels like Resident Evil 5 with the lights dimmed down. THe monsters feel phoned in, the levels range from too vibrant to too dark, the game is largely linear, and the story is recycled from the second game.

There are also only two or three choices made in the game to determine the ending. Before in the older games, like 2, the game measured your progress to determine your ending. DId you rescue this person? Did you get this item? Did you throw it on this person? Did you protect them from harm enough? Did you collect this widget and use it in this whatsit? Well, in Homecoming you have three choices: Kill mom or let her die, forgive dad or forsake him before he dies, or save your token black friend from death. So yeah, pointless.

As a fan of Silent HIll games, I hate to see this exist. It could have been good on its own, but they stuck Silent HIll on the cover and it simply could not live up to the expectations. It rips SIlent Hill 2 story page for page, almost, and then references older games through paper articles like we are supposed to expect this game to be a masterpiece among masterpieces. Not happening.

With that thought, there have been many different puzzle games that've delivered on the Nintendo DS for the past few years including Meteos, Tetris DS, and Pokemon Trozei'. There also have been some that really changed the way we play games completely like Brain Age and Big Brain Academy. But with all the good games that've been exciting, there are a few that aren't as much the challenge as they claim to be. This is definitely one of those games.

Planet Puzzle League for the Nintendo DS, is the latest game for the Nintendo DS, that relies completely on the stylus. In the game , you move colored blocks horizontally to connect three in a row of the same color. The graphics and display are absolutely dynamic, and flow through graciously in the game. The controls are also easy to use in each of the puzzles through the challenge mode, and the endless mode, where you'd have to keep playing, until your screen fills up completely, and you don't have room to link blocks. Sadly, there is a real lack of challenge in this game. You can't move your blocks up and down to make it easier to play, and the gameplay isn't as addictive as other puzzle games on the market.

All in all, I really think Planet Puzzle League feels more like it is a rental, than a must buy for the Nintendo DS. I really didn't find this game as exciting as I thought it would actually be. If you are into a better addictive game, I really suggest you play another addictive game for the system. This one just isn't one of those that doesn't seem to excite gamers enough. It just keeps you blocked in.

Sure there is bloody, graphic violence happening everywhere you turn, but it was a complete letdown for gamers everywhere. The story is about a group called ""Freedom"" which tries to overthrow the evil Corporation that has taken over the streets and stores everywhere. You receive this simple, beat em' up missions that are very repetitive. For instance, ""Protect the hacker while he taps the phone system"", ""Beat up the Mall Rats to get the scientist's lab box"", ""Make sure Kim Woo doesn't loose her pawn shop"" etc. Plus, they aren't at all thought-provoking and they have no element of fun.
If you've heard that there can be up to 100 people on the screen doing totally different things at the same time, that is partially true. Yes, you can see up to 100 people on the screen at once but they all do practically the same thing and it's not very realisitic. For example, if I walk up to any rioter and punch them in the face, they all crawl up in a ball for five seconds, and then run of without fighting back at all. Plus, they all run in the same pattern and a lot of them often walk into walls. Poorly designed considering all the hype this game received.
Another element this game lacks is a multiplayer mode. With all the bloody fun that this game packs, you cannot play with your friends. It's a real shame, I could see so many different types of multiplayer modes being uses like shoot em' up or more tactical modes using all creative weapons.
I rate this game a 3 instead of a 2 or a 1 because of it's depth and the ability to interact with pretty much everything in the environment. For example, I could pick up a trashcan, lawn chair, box, even limbs from a brutalized body as weapons to fight against other people or to smash cars or store windows. Plus there's a wide selection of weapons to choose from to desroy the rioters of the city. Automatic Shoutguns, uzis, pepper spray, axes, baseball bats, grenades and Molotov cocktails are just a few of the many weapons you can use to torture the people in this game. Plus, if you get tired of doing missions for the Freedom group, you can always play Chaos mode which is a complete destroying mode where you collect points for gang murders, blowing up cars, smashing windows, and slaughtering the evil Corporation.

If you've played any other unreal tournament game you should know what you're expecting, it's different, yes, but still very much the same. There's no real campaign or single player to speak of. It's all about the multiplayer.

There's some new features to this game that make it a little more interesting than previous titles, you can customize your character by changing from some preset armor for their head, torso, arms and legs.

Multiplayer can be very difficult if you're new and playing with other people online.

I know some people who just couldn't play online because they couldn't kill anyone, they just died, and died, and died... Finally after being frustrated beyond belief they finally just quit. So if you're not very good at first person shooters (Unless you just want to play with bots) or you can deal with dying a lot (And I mean, a lot) then I don't think this would be much fun for you and not really worth your money.

For those of you that can hold your own, many classic weapons from the past titles are still here. There's still weapons like the bio rifle, the link gun, flack cannon, the sniper rifle, rocket launcher, etc. But they've all been... Well for the lack of a better word, modernized. Everything feels much more real than previous titles, the weapons just feel like something that you can actually use in real life. Everything's also much darker, grittier and bloodier.

I was really excited about this game at first, hearing they had revamped the combat system, about the only thing not great from the previous games.  The actual result was only really a slight improvement.

They modeled it after Devil May Cry (A game near and dear to my heart), but its execution was not good.  There are more camera issues with this game than almost any I've played previously.  Too many times did I find the camera looking at the corner of a passageway while I'm busy fighting on the other side of it.  What little control over the camera you have is useless; instead of rotating around the point of interest (ie, your character) it rotates on its own position.  So instead of swinging around the corner so i can actually see Raziel, it looks in the other direction.

The style in general worked well in Devil May Cry (though I recall less camera issues in that game), but that game had an emphasis on nearly equal melee & ranged combat.  When enemies were offscreen, you could at least shoot at them.  This game has some ranged capabilities (telekenesis or TK), its not something you can use too much of.

I will admit though that using Kain's TK to throw enemies off a bridge, onto a spike, or just pull them closer was suprisingly fun.

That said, when the camera was working correctly, battles were slightly more interesting and frenzied than in previous games, but they also became frustrating sometimes.  Also, the game's attempts at bosses (ghosts of previous pillar gaurdians) were extremely lame.

Graphics-wise, the game is pretty good.  Kain and Raziel both look great, and little things like Kain's mist-form looked suprisingly good.  The lighting/shadowing was particularly well done.

Plot wise, the game is good, but nowhere near the greatness of any of the previous games (except maybe Blood omen 2).  The pacing drags, and it seems a little forumlaic.  Also, while the voice acting is top-notch as usual for this series, the dialogue seemed to suffer a bit; it was a little over the top in some places (the lines and words themselves, not the acting).

The game gets better near the end, and many people will probably prefer it than to the end of the Soul Reaver games.

The fighting/battle action is cool - but nothing wildly different from any of the other adventures of the franchise. After enjoying the intuitive cover of Gears of War, any other game without the benefit of cover is just frustrating and feels retrograde. The AI of your accompanying team is decent and you can hop on a vehicle and manage the weapon while a Noble squad mate drives...for the most part. Sometimes they just go AWOL.

My biggest beef with the game is the length. Way too short and easily finished within a few hours of play. I was slightly shocked when it was done. That and the storytelling was simply ineffectual. One knew what was happening but only had a vague connection to the story, and moments where one should have felt some sympathy for the characters were lost.

All in all, I enjoyed the stealth aspect of the game although I had several issues with it. It was fun taking out a whole room of humans without being seen.

Plot was decent, not Award winning, but decent

BAD
1. Stealth.
Yes, I also mentioned this as being part of the ""good."" Throughout the whole game you hide and I mean hide. You're a vampire after all, you use the shadows as your tool but man, I wanted to at least jump out of the shadows and clock a human.
2. He moves too slow
For a vampire, he is just too slow, unless you upgrade. If a human is shooting at you, they're backing away from you faster than you can get to them UNLESS you've upgraded your vampire powers. This I didn't really get, but I guess the game focuses more on hiding, less on confronting

Like many games I've played in the past, there was always an option to save your progress in the middle of a mission. So there were a few times when I would have to restart the whole mission over and it bothered the crap out of me.
4. The Boss
Beating the boss was easier than beating the missions. Like, really? THIS is the boss. Laughable.

3.0,True,"08 23, 2011",A6ZPLVAUQ6695,B003MUNFW0,neurotome,"I wanted to play a flying game.  In fact, I wanted to play THIS flying game, and I wanted it to be fun.  I ignored all the negative reviews and bought it.  I'm an easy gamer - I can be amused by nearly any game, although my twitch-reflexes aren't what they used to be as I approach the fifth decade of life.

Still, I saw this had an extended single player story mode, and I wanted to fly a lot of different aircraft and participate in missions, and no way did I want to get online and fight 12 year olds, so I bought a copy last week and have been playing it.

I have to say I'm annoyed.  Ubisoft came really close with this game.  There's a lot of great stuff in it.  I love the music - especially the load screen/menu panel music.  And the first 5 or 10 missions are actually really fun - well crafted, full of detail, realistic aircraft, UAVs and so on with different characteristics to explore.  Marking buildings and ships for later destruction using a Predator-type UAV interface - lots of fun.  Night landing on a carrier after a bomb run in an F-35 - spectacular.  Handling a bulky A-10 Warthog as it gets peppered by flak and bombs entrenched ground positions - great.

But then there's a certain mission.  The first screen for it has three spelling mistakes: ""rein"" for ""reign"" and two instances of the word ""seperatist.""  And that is your alert that, basically, you are done with the fun part of the game and are going to get into some hastily done, shoddily crafted missions.  Really, Tom Clancy?  Russia invades Norway to capture an oil derrick to replace their own that got blown up by some terrorist nuke?  I might have believed that in the 80's - shades of SSI's North Atlantic '86, actually.  But come on.

 I actually played the game most of the way through until a final dogfight on 'standard' difficulty mode, where I discovered that the strategy was this:  Turn at full bank on afterburner always, or be hit by a missile.  While turning on afterburner, try to get the 'boss' plane in your sights.  Your missiles won't lock on him - he's the boss, after all.  So, after several hours and countless restarts, rack up 100 hits on him with your machine gun without dying - one at a time, each separated by minutes - and then do the same for the other two planes that accompany the boss.

I gave up.  It was boring and annoying - supremely so - and it was the climax of a series of missions that were just more boring and more annoying.  It felt like good programmers wrote 5 or 6 good missions and then they brought in the B team to churn out another 20 crappy ones.

In addition, attention to little details is poor.  There is one point where cutscenes play after a long mission for 15 minutes in a row.  They're not pausable and not replayable, so if you need to use the restroom, you will miss some.  After you complete a mission, you get a progress screen.  Your progress is saved, right?  No.  Enter the next mission and start the next cutscene; only then is your progress saved.  Manual save?  No way.

Also, I hated this: if your plane is pointed the wrong way when a cutscene starts, sometimes your plane will crash into the ground while the cutscene is playing, killing you.  Now you have to restart that mission.  The cutscene audio fights with the 'you're dead' audio, then just cuts off and you are booted to the 'you're dead' menu.  Any warning when the cutscene is going to start?  No.  Any way of interrupting the cutscene?  No.  Do the plane controls work during the cutscene?  No.  It's just an insta-death, well into a mission, with no save point anywhere nearby.  Feels like a software bug, really.  Good game designers know better.

The game locked up my PS3 3 times so far during play, by the way, requiring restart.  (When you're made to install the required software update, be aware you'll be waiting with the progress bar stuck at 17% for about 10 minutes.  That's apparently intended behavior, not one of the hard freezes I'm talking about.)

There's some neat stuff in the game.  The early cutscenes are tight and exciting, the planes are photorealistic and have a variety of weaponry, modes, and handling traits, the voice actors are really good.  Controls are so so and made my hands sore after about an hour, but they can be customized.  Free flight mode is a lot of fun - almost worth the price of admission - but come on, give us something to shoot at.  And for pete's sake, do not make me 'unlock' the planes.  I will never do that.  Just let me fly 'em.

Plenty of female characters too, including pilots, which is good; unfortunately, every piece of dialog directed at a female character in the entire game includes one of the following phrases: ""Calm down,"" ""settle down,"" ""simmer down.""  Sexism at its worst - got a comment from my wife.  I hate this because it makes the entire video game industry look bad and reduces my chance of retaining a video-game-compatible wife, so companies should take notice and quit doing it.

On balance, it got me off deck, flying, and shooting missiles, which gains it 3 stars.  The best parts of this game are better than Dropship: United Peace Force, a 2-star game with some 4-star flying missions.  There's gotta be a 5 star flying game out there - I like Afterburner Climax, even though it's a port of an 80's game - but I haven't found the real 5 star flying game yet.

  Nearly all of these controllers are garbage, but every time I've tried to sync a ps3 or ps4 controller to one of my android phones, it's a hassle (even with the built in native support now).

The pitching is accurate and varied, the batting is good and allows more skill than Wii sports baseball by letting you shape where you want your shot to go. The two handed play style can seem daunting, but is actually a blast, allowing strike em out-throw em out plays, nasty double plays, and good first jumps by infielders on ground balls.  With regards to controls, I felt the learning curve to be slight.  Myself, my little brother, and even his girlfriend were throwing 100 mph heat or smacking extra base hits around after about an hour (those complaining about the manual...you did see the ""learn the bigs"" mode, right?)

pros:
-rookie mode is varied and fun.
-two handed play is engaging and gets to be intuitive.
-pitching and batting more nuanced than Wii sports.
-big plays can look cool and make you feel like a stud.

cons:
-throwing to bases with a flick of the wrist is hit or miss (mostly miss.)  The D pad doubles up this function though, so not a deal breaker.
-being able to hit home runs at will with a full meter, or snag regular home runs off the wall (30 feet up) gets to be cheap.
-mini games don't have their own mode (need to accessed through rookie mode or through Learn the Bigs...again, not a deal breaker, but could have been nice to have a category like Madden NFL.

neutral:
-music is good, but not varied.
-commentary is funny, but not varied.

I know it sounds trivial, but my Razer Black Widow has no dedicated volume controller so you will need to program 3 out of your 5 macro keys for Vol Up, Down and Mute. I will never buy a keyboard without dedicated multimedia keys again.. the K70 is great for this. Although I do wish the controls were on the left side of the keyboard since I mouse with my right hand. Because the keys stick out so far, the playback buttons are hard to reach without pressing the numberpad keys. Still, this keyboard has relieved the frustration of having to keep the Windows Volume application open all the time.

What I don't like: the no-bezel design. Sure, monitors and TVs with no bezel look modern. But on a keyboard, it just feels awkward. The keys stick out really far since there's no bezel around the edges of the keyboard or around the outside of the keys even. You can't pick the keyboard up to reposition it without pressing keys. The keys around the edges seem very susceptible to damage with no protective bezel. Without a bezel, the keyboard looks sloppy and unfinished compared to the Razer Black Widow. The metal backplate beneath the keys protrudes out around the edges making the edges sharp to the touch. Why are all computer peripherals black these days? I would prefer something lighter like a tan keyboard.

Backlighting: I love the brilliant crimson color. Another nice feature is that the symbols on the number keys, and alt text on punctuation keys is also backlit- unlike the Razer Black Widow. My only gripe is that you can't see the edges of the keys in dim light at all.. you can only see the letters. That's something I like about the Black Widow- you can see the lighting bleed around the key edges.

Key feel: The Cherry Red MX switches feel springy and responsive. However, the double wide keys (Enter, Shift, Backspace) feel smooshy and completely different response than the other keys. Spacebar feels great though and it has a slight texture to it so you know your thumbs are in the right place.

Overall, I prefer the Razer Black Widow over the K70, but I absolutely love having dedicated volume and playback controls on the K70.

The first few worlds are great, but the difficulty of the game quickly ramps up. Personally, I beat Donkey Kong Country, Donkey Kong Country 2, Donkey Kong Country 3 and Donkey Kong 64 with 100%+ completion, but I was never so annoyed or frustrated to the point of putting the game down and stop playing it as I was with Donkey Kong Country Returns. If it weren't for the super guide, I would have never reached the end of the game because I would have stopped playing half way through. I have replayed DKC, DKC2, DKC3 and DK64 several times because they were amazing games, but I have never wanted to play this new installment again. Besides, most of the good things that DKC 2 and 3 added to the franchise are non-existent here. Hopefully, if they make another Donkey Kong Country game, it will be more like the first original games.

Pros:
- Amazing graphics
- Nostalgic music
- Super Guide assistance (thank goodness)

Cons:
- Extreme difficulty
- Lacks some Donkey Kong elements (such as ability to use either Donkey or Diddy, multiple animal friends, etc).

So, the good news is that the Mario-themed case included in this set is the same clear shell case that I have, but with Mario graphics.  The case comes in two separate pieces and snaps securely to the top and bottom of the 3DS.  This is good because if you have an extended battery, like I do, or if you want to use the 3DS's cradle, you can choose to just use the lid protector and leave the bottom uncovered.  As far as protection, it's good enough to prevent scratches and dings, but won't offer protection from drops.

My problem, however, with this set lies with the ""skin"" that's included.  They're cheap, poorly made stickers that don't seem like they'd withstand heavy use, particularly around the buttons and controllers.  These are not the high-quality laminated skins that are sold separately; they feel thin, papery, and cheap--like a sheet of stickers you buy for 99 cents.  It's so bad that I don't even want to apply them to my 3DS.  Very disappointing.

Still, the case portion of this set is great, so I'm giving it three stars.  It's perfect for keeping your 3DS from getting scratched or dinged while in a bag or purse, but without adding any additional bulk.  However, unless you're absolutely sold on needing those Mario graphics on the lid, I'd recommend just buying Hori's plain, clear case and decorating it yourself with better decals that can be found on Amazon.  Sure, you'll pay a little more, but you won't be disappointed by the terrible ""skins"" that are included.","A decent case, but the included skins are terrible",1327449600,,,

There was a lot of hype for this game. I found that it really is atmospheric and professional and the puzzles are varied and competently designed, but I would not say this is a must have game. When I'm not playing it, I'm not thinking about it. I want to get to the end, but I am able to put it down. I want to get to the end because I want closure. I just like to finish what I started.

I don't like the controls or the way you can't change the controls. I get tired of timing jumps and runs and trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do next with objects that are off screen. Maybe if I could pull out and see a bigger view, I'd be less irritated, but don't change the game on my account. It's possible that I would have been just as happy to watch the whole walkthru on youtube rather than suffer through the many deaths that my mistakes inevitable incur. I could have enjoyed two cheap beers while leaned way back in my comfy chair with the money I spent on Limbo and I'd have suffered no tendon pain.

There aren't dozens of ways to play Limbo. No. There is only one way to play it. Pretty much every thing is done one way, the right way or it isn't done at all. Sometimes you'll do something just once in the game and you'll think, ""Wow, pulling off that spider leg on that disabled spider was pretty cool"", but how are you even supposed to come up with that idea? The spiders are real dangerous. Who's gonna get killed trying to yank off a leg when it takes five seconds to regenerate? I guess if I hadn't cheated by looking at the walkthru and I figured out how to kill the dying spider on my own I'd have been pretty proud, but who's going to spend a week on that little part of the game? Puzzles make me feel sad. I like to blow things up and fly around.

You can go anywhere you want in Limbo. Actually, no, you can't. You can go one place, forward. What can you build in Limbo? Well, sometimes you can push a box and pull a lever. That's about it. What about swinging on chains? Yea. You can swing on a chain in Limbo and you can even pull a platform that hangs from two chains.

I actually feel accomplished after defeating the powerful enemy, and then my pawns begin to talk... Pawns are very annoying in this game. They talk a ton and nothing they say is interesting, and they repeat it about a million times.

Then the capital: Gran Soren, is very dull too. All the people walk funny and talk funny too. The people you buy stuff from say the exact same annoying line every time you speak to them like ""The masterworks all you can't go wrong.""

Probably the most annoying part of the game is the fact that you only have 1 save file. With a world this big and it being filled with so many enemies, having only one save file is quite a pain in the butt. And when you hit restart to last checkpoint it does not bring you back to when you first entered the city or in a building, instead it takes you back to the last time you saved on your own or slept.

3.0,False,"12 14, 2015",A3ROQY4VOPG5W5,B00PE1KNPC,Andrew Z.,"I remember distinctly back in the N64/PS1/Dreamcast era talking with all my friends while we're playing Goldeneye 64. An idea popped in my head and I blurted out to everyone, ""You know what would be cool? A game where you just run around and blow everything up."" Everybody agreed, then we started brainstorming ideas: being able to jump out of planes, fly, all different kinds of insane explosives and guns. And here we are, 15+ years later and we have the actual real game that us as kids back in the day were only able to dream about while we played awful, pixelated, clunky first-person shooter on the N64 which we thought at the time it couldn't get any better than that and boy, were we wrong.

Now that storytime is over, here are in 2015 and we have that game, Just Cause, whose sole purpose and agenda is to cause as much in game chaos and destruction as you can. Sounds amazing right? Well, it is. I had a blast with Just Cause 2 when I first played it and in those moments, I was a kid again in the 90's having a total nerd-freakout. Blowing up huge radio towers up with rocket launchers, tethering cars to helicopters and then dropping them on a fuel tank and watching the huge explosion, throwing enemies off mountains with the grappling hook, it was absolutely mind-blowing that one of my childhood fantasies has come to fruition. Unfortunately, Just Cause 2 suffered from one major problem, it depended on  you constantly enjoying blowing stuff up and killing the same generic enemies over and over and over again. That was the entire game and in this new generation of video gaming, I've come to expect games to be a bit more versatile and more well-rounded. The Just Cause games have the gameplay, it's the other aspects that severely lack and ultimately make the fun you have with the game short-lived.

I enjoyed Just Cause 2 immensely, in fact, so much so, I nearly 100%'ed the game, but I found myself slowly falling into complete boredom as I took over settlement after settlement after settlement. The story was bland and seemed thrown together just to have one and mostly comprised of protect and escort missions which is whatever, the game is pretty dated now. Why do I keep talking about Just Cause 2? Well, because Just Cause 3 suffers from the same problems and then some added on top.

I was extremely excited for Just Cause 3, I thought the developers had 5 years to develop it and they were going to go nuts with it. Have a crazy story with fun and unique missions, loads of fun side content that maybe added to aspects of a story, bunch of new gameplay aspects and weapons. This was what I was expecting which I think is fair, the Just Cause series can go anywhere it wants to because it's such an open-ended styled game, they could add anything to this game and it would fit right in, sort of like a Saints Row approach except bigger and better. But instead, the game offers very little of anything new and instead took the conservative approach and just slapped on a new coat of paint on Just Cause 2, added a wingsuit, a handful of different types of challenges and called it a new game.

Doesn't make it a bad game, Just Cause 2 was great for what it was and Just Cause 3 is the same. It's good solid fun for a few hours, but man, it can be so much more. The story, once again, is all escort and protect missions with pretty much the same antagonist and same plot Just Cause 2 had but with a different name. They did try to create some charismatic characters in the game but they're not charismatic enough to make them stand out and be memorable aside from a few chuckle-worthy lines and dialogue here and there. The island layup is very similar to Just Cause 2 just with a new coat of paint. It's huge and there are tons of places to take over but really, it doesn't take long to realize there's only 3 different types of areas: towns, military bases and outposts for a grand total of 130 settlements or something like that. All have the same requirements, just destroy everything there to take it over, they all look the same too, like they didn't even try to differentiate the different towns and villages aside from the capital which is like a small city compared to the others. The military bases have some different characteristics but still contain all the same stuff you need to destroy: fuel tanks, satellite dishes, doppler radar, antennae towers, etc., you know it by now. It is also required you take over settlements because certain story missions won't unlock until you take over a certain amount of provinces so you're forced, much like in Just Cause 2, to continually perform the same tasks, over and over and over again. Like I said though, it is fun, in small doses, but it's hard to fight through it continually just to beat the game.

Controls are sort of wonky, there's a lot of buttons that perform different things in different scenarios so it's very easy to forget which button it is to jump on top of the tank and instead you hit the button that makes you jump out and your tank then proceeds to hit a tree and explode immediately possibly sabotaging your whole mission, but you get used to it eventually after a bit of learning period. You will die, a lot and this is a good/bad situation. The good being, there are no consequences when you die, you respawn right where you were and all your progress is saved and you even get your ammo replenished. The bad being and it's been well documented, but the load times are infuriating and inexcusably long. Every time you die and have to re-load, expect to wait at least a full minute before you get to control Rico again and get back to business, sometimes a lot more, sometimes less, but expect about a minute wait. I consider the game fairly challenging especially if you're new to Just Cause and this game does NOT have a difficulty setting, it's one set difficulty for everybody and you will die a ton, sometimes your own fault, but a lot of times you get completely screwed over by one thing or another. Even the challenges like the bomb runs, the races and the wingsuit challenges, if you mess up and want to retry? Yep, you'll be waiting a good 1-2 minutes before you can get another crack at it and by the time you get the game to load up again, you forget what your strategy was going to be to improve your score and get more gears and you end up failing again.

So, in the end, this game becomes an endless cycle of blowing stuff up, dying/failing, waiting for the game to re-load and do it over and over again. Even the final boss felt like they put very little creative effort into it. 3 shots with the Hydra and it's over just like that. This is a game that greatly disappointed me for not being more innovative but at the same time it is naturally a fun game to play and screw around in for a few hours. In fact, I'd say Just Cause is probably the funnest game to just jump into and screw around in, but the fun doesn't last and it suffers from much of the same issues as its predecessor.

EDIT: I completely forgot to mention this and I don't know where to put it in in the review so I'm putting it down here but the game also struggles to run. It doesn't just drop frames but there some crazy slow downs in the game that don't appear to be frame rate drops but the game is actually slowing down to a crawl. I haven't witnessed this happening in a game in years and it drops to single digit fps often especially when there are a lot of explosions going on. The game desperately is in need of a patch to shorten the load times and just make the game run better overall.","JC3 is the game that we dreamed of being able to play one day back in the 90's, unfortunately the fun is short-lived",1450051200,11,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I did enjoy Reflex more, but I needed something new... I bought this and MXGP2 last month. Both in my opinion are decent games in their own ways. I've played most of the MX vs ATV games from the past and this feels closer to the older games(unleashed and untamed) than it does to Reflex. The graphics are not great. It looks more like an Xbox 360 game than an Xbox One/PS4 game. There are some bugs in the Xbox One version (not sure about PS4). I noticed while playing one of the nationals tracks where it was snowing the frame rate started to drop on me. Other than that though I have been enjoying the game.

Basically. if you played Fallout 3 before, just load it up again and enjoy a better Fallout.

After about 5 attempts, I have managed to complete the second chapter of the main quest.  Save, crash, open box, crash, walk, crash.  Anything you do, crash.

New Vegas is built on the same engine Fallout 3 was built on, which is the same engine Oblivion was built on, yet it crashes more than both combined.  Turns out Bethesda had little to do with this one, this beast is all Obsidian.  Recall, Obsidian gave us the unplayable day one patch game of Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights 2.  Bethesda decided that Fallout 4 was more important and threw this trash to someone else.

From what I have seen so far, this is the same game as 3, but less interesting.  Looks the same, lots of brown and gray.  Sounds the same and crashes more.

If you feel the need to shell out full price for another Fallout DLC, then go for it.  I would say wait a while for a patch to make this mess playable.

It didn't get any better as the story progressed, so please know that I watched around one minute of each cutscene before reaching my threshold. This means that my review score does not take story/narrative into consideration as everything about it is garbage, but it does not detract from the quality of combat.

This game has some of the most enjoyable combat around. This kind of fun has only been found for me in the Ninja Gaiden series. However, the level structure, camera, enemy design, and constant changing of the rules of play all conspire to push combat out of the deserved spotlight of attention. I only played through the game once. Maybe this game is best played using the level select that becomes available upon completion so that you can simply focus on the areas of combat you enjoy.

Bayonetta tries to do far too many things with its time. I never thought I'd say this, but motorcycle and Space Harrier sequences are simply not welcome additions. As I got more and more comfortable with the combo system, I looked forward more and more to using it. Unfortunately, the game refused to allow me that simple joy. Straight-up combat quickly becomes a rare treat instead of the meat of the game that it should be. Even the standard combat situations that come up start to become more troublesome than enjoyable because of the poor visual design of characters like Grace and Glory. They are too fast and their animations are unclear because they are full of spectral lighting effects and obnoxious bloom. Nearly every boss encounter presents a new set of rules to play by culminating in a final boss that forces a completely ridiculous perspective under the character.

I hope there will be a sequel. It is a game that deserves to be great, and I hope some refinement will occur with a second outing, but this one seems to suffer from either too many cooks in the kitchen or one cook who needs to be reined in.

The space combat is real-time and has some strategy to it, but it also is subject to too much luck. It is entirely possible to win or lose based on one lucky or unlucky hit.

Will and Ava scramble to escape the nightmare back to where they only have to worry about Nazi's, when Ava drags Will into the war kicking and screaming. My advice to Will is that there are other women who won't try to drag you into a pan dimensional conflict. Nikolai Tesla also makes an even more stapled on appearance, because everyone knows he vanished into the Triangle for a portion of his life.

Graphics are okay, but I wish that the designers had stuck with a theme. If you're a snake, you make things like snakes, and most of the Watchers are snakes. Snake tanks, flying snake guards, snake-ish looking turrets. But then they threw in generic humanoid looking cannon fodder grunts, and I could almost hear the designer whining in the background that snake movements were too hard to design.

Audio is tolerable, though the alien voices are not. Playing english slowed to 1/16th speed is not innovative or creepy, its laughable. Spend thirty minutes and come up with a hissy snake language. And aliens do not speak in calm, almost bored English when in combat. The remainder of the speeches are cookie cutter in the extreme, though some decent snappy one liners earn it some leeway.

Most of the gameplay is so bland cliched shooter that its sad. Weapons are like any FPS, that is you're cannibalizing either dead humans AR's or the alien energy weapons. Add in some purchasable upgrades and Gears of War cover-to-cover combat to season. The distinguishing feature of this was supposed to be the flight pack. And this was almost nauseating, and not to say its bad. But to survive the flight portion requires so many flips and aerial acrobatics that I frequently became disoriented and nearly, well, nauseous. The ""vertical combat"" that's espoused on the box is a nice innovation, but it becomes tedious and worn out by iteration 3, and is vestigial to the point that even the enemies don't seem to care if you ignore them entirely.

So is Dark Void worth it? A solid shooter that has some decent gameplay innovations, its still severely crippled by weak characters and story, and the repetition starts to sink in deep before the end of the first chapter.

For me, I took the wimp route and beat it without a problem. No, it's not the Game Genie that was used. Listen up, follow this simple strategy, and it will work for you.

Notice in the game how you are able to advance to the next day if you have enough white houses. Then...that's how you beat the game. Get it? No? Ok...fine.

Theoretically and basically, you will advance to the next day if you have at least one white house left standing. Pretty much, who cares about the fact that you either make 10 out of 10 perfectly or miss a ton of them? As long as you make one perfect delivery to one single house, you are good to go for the next day. That's exactly how you should play the game.

So, here is my strategy in terms of beating Paperboy: forget about racking up points by throwing tons of papers, forget about throwing papers to every white house in hopes for gaining a house next day unless you have no fear of being run over by an obstacle, focus on making a perfect run avoiding all obstacles along the way without losing a life, and just hit the two of the easiest houses on the route.

The game is much, much harder if you juggle through hitting white houses as perfectly as you can, riding the bike in an aligned manner, avoiding obstacles side and front, and picking up newspapers. I was pretty much focused on aligning my bike perfectly as I can and just worked on the same two houses every day. I didn't even care about the training course since no lives are lost in that part. I prefer to crash once I am in there, just to save my thumbs from getting sore. That's how the game becomes easy for me to beat.

I actually survived the whole thing with one house left (another one was added on Sunday for a ""perfect"" delivery), making the entire game a joke. Even the farewell part is silly to observe, seeing how laughably many houses I missed, yet I won.

All in all, Paperboy is not as hard as people say.

And in that regard, ""Resident Evil 2"" delivers. The graphics won't wow a hardcore PC gamer, nor will the sound, although the music is effectively eerie. This game offers a some good shocks and good-if-stilted cutscenes, intermixed with some so-so action.
The minuses are serious but not show-stoppers. The graphics and sound effects show the limitations of the consoles they were designed for--no Quake III here, nor even Blood 2, for that matter. (Resident Evil 3 actually goes a good bit farther compensating for this by offering much higher resolutions.)
Saving a game can only be done at a typewriter, and only using a ribbon, of which there are a limited number. I guess that means that if you haven't played through the game by the time you used that last ribbon, you're going to have a =really= long last session. Save game limitations drive PC players nuts, and is compounded here.
The camera angles, while usually quite effective in the atmosphere, also make it, em, challenging, to see what you're doing about a third of the time when you're zombie slaying.
The only other major minus is the dubious pseudo-adventure game puzzles. Find this key, find that key, hook that wheel to that valve, etc. It's not as big a minus as it might seem, because sometimes these slow periods lull you into a false sense of security and set you up for the next good shock. Other times, they're just teidous.
Overall, this game has won me over with its spooky atmosphere and ocassional shocks, but I couldn't call it a classic, unfortunately, at least not this version.","Pros, cons, zombies....",995760000,8,,
3.0,False,"08 19, 2015",A3ULPB81JD4OGA,B000035Y6V,Kelly Groce,"Mega Man X3 came out at the end of the SNES lifespan.  The game just feels like it was rushed out the door.  Several reviewers have commented on how uninspiring the music is in the game and they are right.  In several stages the sound just seems flat and boring except the Vile battle.  Also the game felt like it had too many upgrades, many of which seemed useless to me while playing the game.  What is the point of having 6 capsules if you can only pick 4.  I liked how they brought Vile back and that the game was more challenging than X2 but not really in a good way.  I loved fighting all 3 of the semi villains Bit, Bite and the other guy in X2 I thought that added a lot to the story and was fun.  you get none of that enjoyment from X3 no backstory on the mini bosses.  You do get to play as Zero in this game but I did not find him very easy to use or very practical to use in the game, he is much better in MMX4

Also the one major inconvenience I found in the game was there was no enemy similar to the bats in MMX that would always drop energy pellets or capsules where you could quickly fill up your subtanks.  Or the water stage in MMX2 where you could quickly suck up 9 energy capsules right away to fill your tanks in seconds. Once you get to the final stages of X3 you will need every drop of those subtanks to deal with the cheap attacks from Vile and Sigma and it takes forever to fill the tanks back up. I also felt like the supercharged Boss weapons you get were weak or useless not very handy at all in this game compared to MMX1 or X2.

Mega Man games are held to a higher standard because they have been so good for so long.  Even though this only the 3rd game in the X series both X1 and X2 were great games with a high replay value.  After finally completing this game I had no real desire to play it again.  As with all Mega Man games the play control is very good and you can dash up in this game, but besides that new feature this game is nothing to write home about. I felt the game was just missing that fun element that the other 2 X games had. I have not played the Playstation version of the game but I hope it is much improved over this version.

3.0,False,"12 30, 2011",A2KTUL1TPTGWIX,B002BSA298,Jack Treese,"As a single, twenty-something gamer I decided to check out a Kinect sensor over the summer.  Figuring it would be worth the buy because of the variety of games available (if only I knew), I straight-up bought and brought the bundle home.

Kinect was very easy to set up and get going with (especially for those with a Slim model, since those are Kinect-ready outta the box).  However, here's a bit of a warning:  If you're buying this for a smaller bedroom, make sure to purchase that Nyko accessory for being closer to the sensor because it's a workout alone trying to get the darn thing calibrated.  Then, it finally calibrates (kinda) and I get going.

When not playing games with Kinect, you can use your voice to navigate Xbox Dashboard menus.  However, in order to do any motion-sensor type movements involving the Xbox menu, you first have to open up a very primitive and rudimentary Kinect menu.  And if you really think about it, that's just about all Kinect offers outside of games.  When it comes to gaming with Kinect itself, depending on the game and the way you're situated in the room your game can either be as smooth as a controller game, or as buggy as a patch-free version of Skyrim.  Like I said before, Kinect is very uptight about where exactly you're positioned, and if you even remotely goof it up the game holds on until you get back in position.

Now, speaking of which I found Kinect to be more of a frustrating piece of equipment than anything else.  Sure, it may offer controller-free gameplay unlike Wii, but is it really worth shelling out that much more for?  Maybe if you've got a lot of friends or you can see yourself shuffling through the many shovelware titles that have been released for Kinect since its launch:  ""Yeah, as a single male gamer I'm totally up for non-stop rounds of Dance Central and Zumba Fitness.  And instead of Guitar Hero, let's play Child of Eden!""  Gimme a break. [though I will say, I really wanted to check out Rise of Nightmares before I gave up on this]

To wrap up an already-too-lengthy review about this POS, I had the sensor for a good week or so before trading it in for a piece of hardware MUCH MORE DESERVING of my hard-earned money:  A 3DS.  If you're a gamer's gamer, pick up one of those or a couple new PS3/Xbox/Wii games instead.  If you're either (a) a large family, (b) a rich family that doesn't care about wasting money, or (c) a large and rich family that doesn't care about wasting money, this is right up your alley.

They kept most of the things that made the series great originally. That surreal mix of 1950's/early 60's patriotism and stark, cynical and tragic realities of an atomic apocalypse. Brutal, funny, sad and touching all rolled into one. It had bugs but overall was a great game.

It *mostly* does justice to what it promises. A few things have changed this time around, most obviously in a more streamlined crafting system and various new weapon and ammo types. There are a few new perks and such as well, but nothing too extremely different. I found I had a LOT more bugs in this game. Not unworkable but much more than in Fallout 3. The landscape is mostly desert, and not too impressive. They should have taken a few tips from Red Dead Redemption in a South Western U.S. style landscape. Vegas is separated into different mini-towns but except for one or two locations, isn't very impressive either. Many of the cool little details that made it fun to explore in Fallout 3 are missing here, with a few exceptions. Overall, this gave me the feel of a rushed game. One they skipped on details with in order to get it out faster. The famous radio stations are there, with the main one being Radio New Vegas. The famous Wayne Newton supplies the voice this time. I thought that would be a cool thing but compared to Three Dog, he's just not cutting it.

This is an MMO so Elder Scrolls fans shouldn't expect to be able to change the world in this game as much you can in the single player version (but I think MOST TES fans know this).  You can't kill that quest giver because the next guy needs him too.  It's been 2 months since release and I've decided to give up my subscription.

Things I liked?
The crafting system is pretty good and the food and potions were similar to what you would make in a TES game.  The ingredients were just as much of a pain to find as well (which is good in my opinion).  There are special crafting stations scatttered around where you can make gear with special stats if you are wearing 3+ pieces.

The PVP was fun and I don't typically like PVP.  You can go solo if you want, but the idea behind the PVP zone (capturing keeps mainly) is more oriented for group PVP which I enjoy more.

Books!  I don't mind going to every bookshelf in an attempt to level up a skill.  And it's one of those little things that make it feel like a TES game.  Same with lockpicking.  Chests spawn in random locations and you don't lose the lockpick when you use it.

Things I didn't like?
As others said, customer service and their maintenance of the game itself.  There was the bug that others here have listed where you fall through the world.  Customer Service's answer was that it was somehow my fault and I needed to turn my graphic settings down.

Then there are still the bugged quests even after 2 months.  In the first month you received an email if you submitted a bug report, but in the past month I have gotten no indication that they have read them other than a week later (yes a week) the quest is no longer bugged.  For one bugged quest, I logged out nearby so I could complete it when I logged in and 3 days later it still wasn't fixed.  The 4th day I logged in to find that the event was no longer bugged, but the NPC to trigger it was.  This was why I decided to cancel my account actually.

Bots are everywhere and this company doesn't seem to want to do anything about it.  Oh, that's not true- they nerfed the ability they are spamming when grinding.  Of course, this has nerfed it for those of us who aren't bots either.  If you report them, they will remove the bots account and then refund the botter's money so they can just go out, buy a new license and continue on with a new account.  Very generous of them.

The questing is a lot more limited than it might appear at first.  Every quest giver has an arrow over their head and you are told when you complete all the quests in a zone.  I like talking to NPC's and I talk to every one I can and I have never gotten a quest from one that didn't have an arrow over their head.  The most that has happened is an area of the map has been revealed that I otherwise wouldn't have gotten without traveling there.  I was really hoping for some NPC's randomly giving out quests when you speak to them.  I heard that this was done in the early portion of the beta, but people didn't like having to actually work to find the quests so they started marking them.

 In the end, it wasn't the limited quests or massive amount of bots that made me unsub though - it was definitely the lame service that made me quit.  Your monthly fee is supposed to pay for people to make sure everything is working smoothly in-game and I just felt like I wasn't getting what I was paying for.  Blaming customers for bugs that should have been taken care of before release is crap.  Taking 4 days to a week to fix a glitched quest?  Pathetic.  There are games out there that are free to play that have better service than this!

3.0,False,"03 8, 2010",A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B001PKHRUK,Armando N. Roman,"When I heard that X-Men Origins: Wolverine was a good game, I wondered if it was a joke. A good game based on a mediocre movie? No way. But I went and bought the game, and low and behold, I was having a blast within the first 5 minutes. No other game has made me feel as awesome as Wolverine. THIS is how Wolverine's other games should've been. No limits on using claws, no toned down violence, no melodramatic plots, just straight up action. The funny thing is that I normally don't like violent games, but this one's just so over the top that it sucked me in.

The story? I didn't pay much attention to it to tell you the truth. You play between the present day story and one from 3 years earlier- Wolverine in the jungle while on a military operation. A lot of it has to do with revenge on his brother Victor Creed, and superior William Stryker. The game's all about action though, and chances are that you won't care for the plot anyway. Wolverine goes from location to location tearing everyone a new one, and taking on some major X-Men characters along the way.

The number of ways Wolverine kills his enemies is impressive. The first one that really got me was when he lunged to a helicopter, smashed through the glass, then pulled the pilot out and held him up so the helicopter blades decapitated him, and created a huge red swirl. My jaw dropped when I saw that since I didn't see it coming. In fact, I replayed that scene 4 times just to do it again- it's that cool. Enemies also get dismembered in different ways depending on how you slash them. Wolverine can also use objects in the environment to quickly dispatch them as well, like wooden spikes, mini-cement mixers, forklifts and more. You have three main attacks- light slash, heavy slash and throw, and then 4 special attacks as well that can be used when you build your Rage meter up. Wolverine also has a great Lunge ability where you lock on to an enemy, and as long as the view isn't blocked or they're not too far/high, he'll leap toward them and you can go from there with how you want to attack. The Lunge is awesome, and I loved that there'd be certain parts where the camera would switch to right in front of the enemy so you'd see Wolverine pop up behind them. Comedic gold right there. Also, Wolverine's healing factor and Feral Sense are here. You heal after a few seconds, as long as you're not getting attacked, and this helps gameplay so you're not constantly looking for health packs. Pressing up on the d-pad changes the visuals and highlights key locations and points you out on where to go next, kind of like the guide feature in Dead Space.

So why the average rating? I wanted to give this 3.5 stars, but since I couldn't I rounded down due to some of the problems. First- the boss fights aren't that fun, at all. These guys take forever to whittle down, even the first boss which later appears as more of a mini-boss. I found myself getting bored. One that really got me was the boss in chapter 4 where I had to restart the battle NINE TIMES because it'd constantly glitch on me, and he'd either disappear from the level completely, or he'd get stuck on part of the platform and freeze, not taking any damage no matter how I attacked. So I had to be very careful with how I fought him just to try and prevent glitches. That part nearly made me quit on the game. Lastly, gameplay gets really repetitive by level 3. Since Wolverine doesn't have a lot of different combos, most attacks look the same and all of them are equally effective.

Visually, the game's a mixed bag. When the camera zooms in on character models, they either look good, or like an early-ps2 game. Cutscenes looked phenomenal though. And you gotta love how they show Wolverine's injuries in-game while he heals. Watching him run around with a hole blasted through his chest was just plain cool. The voice acting's all good too- no complaints here.

While I did have fun playing the game at first, 20+ hours is a long time to be doing a lot of the same attacks and fun-deprived boss fights. This was definitely a great effort on the developer's part, and the game deserves the good scores it's gotten, but the glitches (especially in that boss fight) kept me from wanting to play through it again.

I do not like how they only have one fighting style and a weapon style. So you can't really do any combos that change from one fighting style to another. Another thing I don't like is that you can only create one character per profile, unlike the wrestling CAW's. The konquest mode, in my opinion was pretty weak. First, they producers said there would be 2 modes- a good, and an evil. It is neat, however, how Taven fights in the konquest mode, but you fight people every other second, and you really cannot explore. What happened to the Chaos realm? Orderrealm? You don't see much of the realms at all, and my favorite part of Deception was the fact that you could explore all kinds of stuff, meditate and get secret things, talk to people and do side missions. It feels as though they rushed this game a tad.

I'm not saying it is a bad game, by no means, because it's not- I'm just saying, in my opinion, it's not as good as Deception. And why is Blaze all of a sudden the main character and a giant monster? Cool, yes, but it's kind of odd that they chose Blaze. To be honest, the story mode is a tad confusing. It almost seems like they are trying to cram way way too much into it, but without dedicating a lot of time to the story mode.

Also, I don't like how you cannot do wagers in versus battle. So, basically, you have to complete the konquest mode multiple times or do the arcade a lot to get koins to create a fighter. I'm not a fan of the krypt, either. They made a huge fuss about how they wanted it to be called the Vault.

And, just like with Deception, they promised to have ripped clothing etc. when you fight in the arcade, and yet again they failed to do so.

I know they took a chance with fatalities, and that's ok, but I think I speak for a lot of people when I say they are pretty weak fatalities. I mean, most of the fatalities in the last 3 games weren't too great and didn't seem to have a lot of thought put into them.

Overall, there are a lot of cool things in the game, but more disappointing things, especially when they claim it's the mother of all MK games. You can't go back into the story mode and explore anything, which is a bummer. I do like a lot of parts in the story mode, but it's not long enough and you can't really see the realms in all of their glory.

There is allot to like about this game, though unfortunately it has some shortcomings as well. On the plus side the action is top notch. The ""futuristic"" weapons are fun to use and offer a bit of fresh air on the traditional ""pistol, shot gun, flame thrower"" mix that one usually expects in these types of games. Furthermore the enemies are challenging, and to successfully defeat them you have to ""strategically"" target various body parts to most efficiently put them down, simply put the combat is very very fun. Next the environments are beautiful, the various places you will go are reminiscent of a big budget sci fi movie. On the negative side the story is quite poor and does not develop/conclude in a manner that is at all engaging or satisfiying. Furthermore the game is quite short, it is a 10-12 hour experience. Now even though the story is dissapointing, those 12 hours of gameplay are very challenging and very fun. If this game had a more fully developed/executed story this would be a 5 star game.

He has returned to the family castle after an absence of twelve years to attend the funeral of his grandfather, William, dead under mysterious circumstances.  As Samuel investigates William's death he begins to uncover hidden family history.  It's up to him to find the truth and break the curse that has burdened his family for generations.
_Black Mirror_ is a mix of the good, bad, and indifferent of Adventure games.  First the good:  The graphics and sound are lovely, particularly the atmospheric effects. The storm sequences were so realistic that I at one point refused to let my cat out because of the weather, eventhough it was dry outside.  The leaves on the trees are articulate, moths flutter around lanterns at night, water moves realistically.  This was a lovely game to look at, which added to the experience.
And that's a good thing, because the gameplay itself was part of the indifferent.  There was nothing really special, no puzzle that was realy challenging or event that was a stunning twist.  The story progressed about as one would expect.  There were a lot of questions left unanswered and a lot of places where I hoped for more, or for something unusual, that I never got.
The puzzles were mainly a mixture of inventory, conversation and mechanical.  None was particularly hard, especially since there was a great deal of repetition.  I lost count of the number of keys you had to find, and at least 3 separate puzzles had the exact same solution. Sometimes there was a bit of pixel hunting involved.  Also, _Black MIrror_ was fairly  linear, meaning that you had to keep revisting places to see what had changed after you'd had certain conversations.  Sometimes this was taken to extremes:  you'd know what to do but if there was one person you hadn't talked to about it you still couldn't do it.  There was also a lot of random waiting:  people would tell you ""yes, I can help you but come back later.""  And I swear there was nothing you actually had to do before ""later"" arrived but wander around and keep asking over and over.
Which brings us to the bad.  The ending of this game was truly awful, I think about the worst ending in game history.  It didn't make any sense and there were so many loose ends that didn't get tied up that I felt like I'd missed about half the game.  It was as if the game developers just got tired and quit. Or maybe they took a break meaning to come back to it later and just forgot.  It put an incredibly bad taste in my mouth.
I also did not find the game as advertised as far as the psychological exloration and thrill factor.  It was quite plodding at times and many things were neither as frightening nor as challenging as they could have been.  Aside from some gore, this title does not merit a horror rating.
_Back Mirror_ was quite long, about 35 hours.  There were a few stumpers, mostly due to pixel hunting--nothing that needed a walkthrough or hint, if you were willing to be patient.  If the ending had been better, I would have considered this a great game and a good value.  However, I was left very disappointed.

What is Overwatch? It's a fusion of Team Fortress 2 (First Person Shooter) with a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) selection of heroes. It takes place from a first person perspective and has a variety of game modes to play from escorting the payload, capture and hold, and a variety of rotating modes (such as Mei's Snowball bonanza, or whatever it's called).

As a shooter, Overwatch requires skill and does a decent job of making each character's weapons feel unique. Each hero has to be played in a different style and has unique abilities that they can activate. Tracer, one of the more extraordinary characters has a teleport ability that can be ""rewound"" to bring you back to her previous position and health.

There are a variety of maps and modes. I found most of the maps easily forgettable. As for modes, the best modes are the generic ones - capture and hold, escort the payload. unfortunately Blizzard decided to grant loot boxes (cosmetic items) if you play their rotating modes. I found myself grinding these maps just to get the cosmetic items (or because friends wanted to get the cosmetic items), but not having any fun doing so. The Mei's snowball mode was probably the best and most interesting (one-shot kills with one-shot ammo) while others, hero mode where all characters are the same hero or one of two heroes, elimination (3v3 in tight quarters), no cool-down mode (self explanatory), all felt gimmicky. I'd much rather have played the main game for loot crates.

I've logged a few hundred hours into Team Fortress 2 and have to say that on a wholly personal level, that TF2 is way more fun. I can't pinpoint what it is exactly but Overwatch's matches lack that fun factor that I found playing TF2. The matches in Overwatch seem calmer than TF2. I found myself much less engaged in the Overwatch matches than a typically TF2 match. It's not a bad game, but it was boring to me. The roster of heroes didn't do enough to make me want to continue playing this and grinding for loot boxes on the rotating maps definitely left me burnt out and not desiring another match.

All in all I give this a 3 star - an ok game.",Underwhelming,1482796800,4,"{'Edition:': ' Origins', 'Platform:': ' PC Download'}",
3.0,False,"11 25, 2003",A3IG2ZD9HPTJJH,B0000D9SQ6,William F. Soule,"The new Mario Kart was definitely aimed for a younger audience. First, there is the ""kiddish"" music. While previous musical tracks from Mario Kart got you into the competition, this game's music makes the game seem more like Baby Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
Second, the simplistic and limited number of race tracks. There are only 16 tracks (after unlocking Special Cup), and after a while of racing all of them, they get kind of boring. The tracks are simple, and there are not very many hidden shortcuts to discover, which would make the replay value of these race tracks increase. Because of the gamecube and Nintendo's capabilities, one would expect a bit more complicated and funner tracks. Even the Special Cup tracks were a bit disappointing. The N64 Special Cup tracks were fun and difficult, but they simplified all the tracks in this game for the younger audience.
Third, the graphics. The graphics are very colorful and vibrant and make the tracks and the game in general look very fun. The characters all look great, and overall, Nintendo did a good job of making this game very flamboyant.
Fourth, the battle arenas. The battle arenas (along with the tracks) are also very simplistic (especially the Gamecube arena...). There isn't really anywhere to hide (a fun thing about the N64 version) or any great stand-out features of any of the arenas. The arenas were made very simple so that the younger audience would be able to emerse themselves in a quick, all-out battle royale against their fellow peers.
Fifth, the battle modes. There are a few battle modes to choose from (including the classic balloon match), but the most annoying mode is the bob-bomb match. In the bob-bomb match, what happens is the match starts, bombs fly everywhere, and in about 10-15 seconds, its over. The person who wins usually wins out of sheer luck. Not much skill is involved to win, just luck. The same goes with the Shine-Thief battle. You just have to hope that your opponent doesn't get any red shells.
Sixth, the computer A.I. In 50cc, and 100cc (easy and normal, respectively), the computer players are too easy. Another valid specification of MK:DD!! for the younger audience. This audience wants to be able to feel good about themselves when they win the cups and not get frustrated and throw their controllers across the room when they don't. But, as for 150cc (EXTRA EXTREMELY HARD), the A.I. makes a quantum leap and becomes extra difficult. In order to win, you need sheer luck with what items you get, because it seems that every single computer opponent is out to get you. Only certain characters can achieve 1st or 2nd place with less difficulty as well as certain karts, so the player must choose wisely. 150cc was probably Nintendo's way of compensation for the more mature audience that is looking for more of a challenge.
And lastly, the innovative two-characters-per-kart system. What a good way to promote teamwork! This style of playing is very fun, and features a break from the normal one-person-per-kart limit. This would definitely catch the attention of the younger (as well as the older) audience. But one thing I discovered, though, is that this tends to aggrevate the teammates, as they tend to 'scapegoat' one another when one of them messes up and costs them the 1st place spot.
Overall: This game is all right, but I think the younger audience would enjoy it more than the mature audience. This game would be a great party game, but don't count on it to provide hours and hours of entertainment (it took me two days to unlock everything). But don't hesitate to buy it for the little ones.",A bit overrated...,1069718400,,,

3.0,False,"11 3, 2009",AC6LV5D2RKTIR,B001UWGBC8,Michigoon,"Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 is a pretty fun party game. I went through the game with 2 players in co-op, and completed both storylines. For the second playthough, the game offers a ""Legendary"" difficulty which is sort of a New Game+ option where you keep your levels but get a correspondingly higher difficulty. I had a pretty good time, but I have to admit that it's an experience with plenty of flaws that could turn some players off.

Let's just get this out there- if you're not playing this game in co-op, you're only getting a fraction of fun. This title does have numerous flaws, but most of them are outweighed by the fun of stomping around with a group of friends. Playing alone, this is only a mediocre title. Playing with four friends, this is an absolute party. I would consider at least 2-player co-op an absolute must for this title. You can play it alone, but really, try not to.

The gameplay essentially consists of mashing buttons with some RPG elements overlaid to allow you to customize your heros. However, strict level requirements mean that the customization rarely goes farther than scaling back the one power you least like to make sure the other 3 are as high as they can go. You can leave the auto-spend option on and there's very little gameplay difference.

You get to build your own team of heros, but there's a lot of problems here too. There's a pretty good stable of characters (23?), but this feels very constrained. Consider the Civil War storyline, and many characters will be unavailable due to picking sides. Thor and Hulk require collecting items, and Juggernaut is pre-order only. You'll really only have about a dozen characters to select from on your first playthrough. There are times in the game when you'll be hard-pressed to find healing tokens, so any character with a slim health bar is a major liability. Spider-Man and Storm for instance are both great fun to play, but bosses can KO them very nearly in one hit. Personally, I kept to tanks and regenerating characters (Wolverine, Deadpool), and I still had several instances where I had to wander around praying for health drops. (Random note: Hulk and Thor have to be unlocked, but there's a code you can input to unlock them at the start without hurting your game. I recommend this very highly- look it up).

The game length is fairly short- even if you're really searching for all the items and spending a lot of time checking out bonus materials, I'd only expect 20 hours from the main story. You can replay the game, but 90% of the game is the same, with less than a handful of really unique maps per side. You're really only going to replay mostly for the few characters you missed out on based on the story choices, and as said, that's pretty limited anyway. And the story isn't great. Sure, it's fun comic fare with a few twists, but it doesn't even stay true to the Civil War storyline. This is not a spoiler for the game (although it is a spoiler for the comics)- in the comics, Capt. America actually dies at one point. In the game, that never happens. That event isn't changed or sidestepped, it actually does not happen at all. For all the hype about this storyline, it's puzzling as to why it isn't even carried through. The whole plot is basically generic and forgettable. Not bad, but not great.

A final note is on the art. As a whole, the game has pretty good graphics. Again, not great but good. There's a lot of puzzling choices for character design though. Spider-Man appears in his modern form that everyone's familiar with, but Gambit appears to be some sort of Xtreme (and really terrible) version. Most every character has an alternate costume, and Spider-Man's alternate is his Tony Stark costume- if you're not a comics fan, you probably have no idea what this is, and it suffices to say this outfit had very mixed reaction from fans. Meanwhile, Venom's alternate costume is just a different art style, but Hulk's costume is the Red Hulk, which is technically a different character entirely. Things just feel really slapdash all over on this account- the artists really needed to settle on one era or aesthetic and apply it across all of the game. It's fun to have some options for the costumes, but often you're just praying the alternate costume is the ""real"" character design they should have used in the first place. (For fans- Jean Grey appears in her Phoenix outfit, but changes to her classic era X-Men outfit... where's modern Jean Grey?).

So in the end, you have a mediocre game with some really fun multiplayer, and a lot of simple fun with selecting some of your favorite heros and stomping around the battlefield. If you've got some friends or a significant other to play this game with, it's a fully enjoyable co-op experience that's definitely worth owning. I'm sure there will be a downloadable pack with extra characters in the near future, and that could add even more fun to the mix. If you're going to be playing this one solo, it's really rental territory or a low-priority buy. You'll play it once, maybe twice for the other side of the conflict, and forget it.","Not a great game, but good co-op fun.",1257206400,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

It was sold out everywhere for the longest time, to the point where I was almost buying into the hype that this was -the- title to have for the ps3. The demo was really cool, but I could only play that over and over so many times. When I finally got the game, everything rocked. I was having fun, enjoyed dressing up Sackboy in the vast variety of costumes, and getting to play with other people online in story and user-created levels was a smooth experience.

All of that fun lasted about 2 hours.

The tagline for LittleBigPlanet is 'Fun shall overcome', and I was hoping that it'd live up to that phrase. It certainly has all the production values in it to be a great game, and you can tell the developers put tons of time and effort into everything. I really can't say I've played any other game with this much attention to level design and trying to make things different with gameplay. Unfortunately, they didn't seem to put enough time into control. And I know a lot of other people are in the same boat as me, but tend to overlook that and just go on about the positives without bringing up the key negatives.

The story's simple, though there really isn't one. You control Sackboy, playing through LittleBigPlanet, a land where everyone's imagination collects and runs wild. You guide him through various levels, usually with the key being to make it from the beginng to end, though some levels have different tasks and objectives. One level might have you reunite a baby animal with its mother, while another has you driving around to get a new, better car. Gameplay is mostly platforming with a few new twists. There are three different layers you can run on (background, foreground and middleground), so if something's in your way on one layer, you can just jump to a different one and bypass it. There are prize and point bubbles found in each level that up your score or give you new stickers and objects you can use to decorate the levels with, and new costumes as well.

Again, this game has everything that I'd love to play. But the big problems for me, were the controls for Sackboy. First, I feel this should've used the d-pad and not the analog stick. Since it plays like a 2D platformer, using the analog stick felt weird to me. Instead, the d-pad is used to change Sackboy's facial expressions. It's a cute addition but they didn't have to do that- it could've been assigned to another option on the menu. Sackboy really got on my nerves though, when it came to jumping. When you jump, Sackboy suddenly turns floaty, and you control yourself in the air before you come down. It feels like you're in space half the time. I never felt like I was getting better at playing the game because of how the physics work. It didn't help that you only have 4 'lives' per section in a level (there are mini-checkpoints scattered through each stage) and once you lose them all, you have to start over from the beginning. There also isn't much to the levels themselves. While I said the objectives have some variety, progressing through levels usually comes down to 'drag this to this spot' and 'hold onto this and swing over here'. Something I also would've liked was for you to be able to change how Sackboy plays. You can already dress him up how you want, why not make the different outfits or their pieces make him do different things? Being able to jump higher would've been a huge help. I know they were probably trying to make the gameplay as simple as possible, like an old school platformer, but old school platformers had precise jumping for the most part.

What the game really comes down to is the level creation. You can create damn near anything you want to. Whenever I go online, there's always a dozen or so levels that floor me. One I've seen was based on South Park, and had all the main characters as people you can talk to in order to find out what to do next, and they looked -just- like their animated counterparts. If you're the kind of person who likes customization features in games, LittleBigPlanet is for you. You can spend hours upon hours just creating 1/4 of a level. And get this- there's a steady flow of new objects that you can buy online. The most recent one was based on Pirates of the Caribbean.

Visually, LittleBigPlanet looks very good. It doesn't push the ps3 to its limits by any means, but a lot of the levels are just plain beautiful, and I love the art direction. The calavera/Dia de los Muertos wedding levels really stood out the most and I applaud those who worked on them. There wasn't any slowdown I experienced while playing the main game, but it happens sometimes while playing online due to loading and other players popping in and out. The music for the game is equally good with as much variety as the Jet Set Radio games. Some levels have peaceful, happy music while others have rockin' tracks or Latin dance. Sadly, my copy was the censored version, where one level (Swingin' Safari) has just the music and all the lyrics removed from the song (Tapha Niang by Toumani Diabat) because two verses were quotes from the Qur'an. Rather than just taking out those two lyrics, ALL the lyrics were taken out from the song. If you haven't heard it yet, check it out- it's a very good song.

There are a lot of better platformers out there, and it hurts me to say that about a game this cute and well-made. But I was having fun infrequently, and most levels were more irritating than they were challenging. Had the physics for even just jumping been improved, this would at least be a 4 star game. But again, if you like games that you can customize the bejesus out of, look no further than LittleBigPlanet.",LittleBigProblems.,1269302400,3,,

Bundle
o Includes a proprietary wireless transceiver that plugs DIRECTLY to a proprietary slot on the [Recon3d Sound Blaster].

Separately
o Includes a stand for the headset.
o Includes a USB (non-Recon3D sound quality) transceiver.

That said, you can't use them together if bought separately, because of different transceivers. You HAVE to buy the bundle if you want Recon3D experience with the [Tactic3D Omega headset].

This product would have received 5 Stars if not for the price of the product. I think it's a bit expensive. To be precise, I think the included [Tactic3D Omega headset] is a bit overpriced, even in a bundle. I did love the [Recon3D Sound Blaster] module though and was really impressed with the build quality and output. And so I am gonna give it 4 stars, until...

I started to notice a terrible problem with the whole wireless process. Simply put, turning ON the headset creates so much radio signal interference that it completely blocks my wireless router signal, and *sometimes* disrupts my wireless mouse. I never had this kind of problem before especially with a headset. I was really, really disappointed to know that it is the headset that is causing my wireless network disconnection. I get disconnected so much that at first I thought I had a faulty router. But then, through trial and error, I have concluded that it was indeed the headset. This was really unacceptable. I now have great feelings of regret as I should have just gotten the standalone [Recon3D Sound Blaster module]. I wish I could get back my 250 bucks and buy the Sound Blaster for a hundred bucks AND get a more decent headset for $150. A do spend a lot on headsets and earphones, but this was just very, very disappointing and not worth the asking price.

GOOD
+ [Recon3D Sound Blaster] has excellent build quality. Very Solid.
+ [Recon3D Sound Blaster] produces excellent sound output.
+ Great battery life for the [Tactic3D Omega Headset].
+ The integration of the headset with the [Recon3D Sound Blaster], I guess..
+ The [Tactic3D Omega Headset] DOES have a good build quality.

BAD
- The [Tactic3D Omega Headset] creates way too much radio interference (to the point that it blocks your WiFi - imagine a signal blocker).
- The [Tactic3D Omega Headset] was very overpriced in my opinion.
- NO HEADSET STAND (Buy them separately and you get the stand, but no Wireless transceiver for your SB)
- The [Tactic3D Omega Headset] puts too much stress on my ears with prolonged use.

No doubt i was a victim of ""bundle"" marketting. Now that I think of it, I would have been better off with their Aurvana In-Ear3 anytime over this Tactic3D. To be fair, it's not that bad, but I've had better at the given price range.

No doubt this would have received only one star if not for the [Recon3D Sound Blaster] module.

I'm semi-torn for a good review for this because I do have a semi large hand, and it feels really awkward to use claw grip with this mouse, which I do.  I really dislike the placement of the thumb buttons because that attributes to some of the difficulty (with a gentle grip I can claw it and not accidentally hit buttons) but it still feels strange.  The ring finger rest on the side doesn't get used much due to my preferred grip, and when I do, it does somewhat help me grip the mouse easier. Problem is, I HAVE to squeeze with my pinky and ring finger fairly hard to secure a good grip on this mouse when I decide to move it (I don't have the best room for my mouse).

Other than that, the LEDs are nice, and basically blue is a requirement for any mouse that I own now, I have had some issues with certain side buttons not functioning exactly when I push them, but otherwise, I really only NEED 6 side buttons.

3.0,False,"03 28, 2015",A28CCN6VYHRUKS,B00P45U43O,Andy Gray,"This is one of those products that seems to fit a need, until you realize the number of faults that the overall design of the unit itself has.

Anyone who had an Xbox 360 knows about overheating issues. They happened fairly often and at times the results were bad, very bad. The Xbox One is designed to have better cooling, air flow, etc - but Antec is playing off of past generation concerns here. That's not entirely bad, a cooler console is never really a bad thing.

Set up is easy, it comes with a 4"" USB cable, rests on top of the Xbox One and plugs into the back USB port for power. Easy peezie to set up. There are even little rubber soles to prevent the unit from scratching the actual console.

Now the not so good stuff.

First off if you can not look down at your console, you will have a difficult time reading the temp as it is displayed ontop of the actual unit.

Second, it blows the hot air out the back of the unit. Depending on where you have your console set up, and what type of entertainment center you have, this could cause your console to suck back in that warm air and have very little positive effect.

Third, the unit itself is not secure. It is merely resting on the console so any type of brushing against it has the chance to move it and push it off.

Forth, there is no way to manually turn it on/off. It turns on when the core temp of the Xbox One is 86 degrees F. Then turns off. Why not have a button for when you know you are going to be playing longer? On top of that, even when it's not on, it still makes noise - which is odd.

When my 360 had over heating issues, I looked at all the options out there and ultimately settled on a standard laptop fan that I rested the Xbox on and blew air straight up. If I ever feel the need to look for a cooling solution for the Xbox One that is probably what I would try first. While this Antec unit looks nice, I never got the 30% cooler results. I'm guessing that is in part to the design flaws I talked about above.

Five years ago my son decided to start watching it as well and has grown to love it just as much as me.  We know the TV version pretty much inside and out.  So when we got him a DS for Christmas, this game was a given.  While the idea is good, the execution isn't the greatest.

1) There are only four avatars available and none of them fit your average, every day, middle aged female.  One is crazed looking and the other about 80.  I can not imagine they couldn't have come up with at least a couple of more options.

2) The game moves very slowly.  There are pauses between every action.  The screen shots of the prizes are grainy and gives it a low budget look and feel.

3) The game flow really doesn't make sense.  Why should you get to play a pricing game if you loose in contestant row?  If you're playing multiplayer, why do both get to the show case when only one can win at the big wheel?  I understand there has to be some modifications, but these do not seem to make a lot of sense.  Basically you win, whether you win or not.

4) I wish there was an option to toggle the instructions on how to play the pricing games.  a) those who have watched the show are already going to know and b) after you've played the game a few times, it's easy to remember the instructions.  No need to continue repeating them over and over again.  At least enable the user to tap the screen to speed up the process.

5) I'm not sure where they got their pricing, but I tend to think some of them are a little low.  I had a show case with a car, grill, and another item.  All total it was less than 14,000.  Makes you wonder if it was a used car.....

6) This one is for those that know the TV show.  The person with the highest winning total stands on the right in the showcases, not the left.  Not a big deal, but shows a lack of attention to details and something that could have easily been corrected.

7) Limited game play due to the lack of games available and the ease of memorizing prices.  It lacks enough variety to be a game that gets a ton of time.

3.0,False,"01 4, 2011",A20TZ1MQ0KMJRR,B0030MOTNE,Jaha,"Most experienced gamers know that licensed games are usually hit or miss, leaning largely on the miss side of things.  Most of them are just hashed out off the base code of a similar original title and they are almost never finished or polished.  Worst of all, most Licensed games never really stand out.  Tron falls pretty much right in there.  It's a fun game for a short spell but it carries little to keep the gamer involved long term.

The game suffers from the basic flaws of most movie tie in games.  This game was probably rushed int he final stages to meet a pre-film release.  As such the game doesn't feel entirely polished.  Therefore the game suffers from numerous issues.

1. Controls.  The game functions much like Prince of Persia.  It's basically the same engine with the player running up walls and swinging from ledges.  The controls are quite touchy though.  If you aren't lined up just right your character will fail in their jump or whatever else they are doing.  Plenty of times things are just sticky.  Like jumping from magnet nodes lots of time you will be mashing the keys to prolong the jump only to watch your character plummet to their death.  The controls on the Tank segments are flat out lousy as it is infuriating trying to drive the tank in a straight line.  Light cycle is also awful as we will address later.  Basically everything in the game feels as though you have to be so incredibly precise.  You will get better as the game goes on but you will miss a lot of jumps simply because the controllers just aren't good enough for the constant precision the game demands of you.

2.  Camera.  This leads to even further control problems.  The camera is only partially fixed.  Meaning it is loosely fixed on you but in no particular direction.  What happens is that as the environment changes and you are jumping around the camera swings wildly often times making you quite dizzy and disoriented.  When you add the camera spinning wildly to the touchy controls and well you can imagine the horror that will ensue.  You will find yourself jumping into chasms in no time for no apparent reason other than the spinning camera has you completely lost as to which direction you are moving.  This gets worse in combat.  Often times the camera will spin or even get stuck on walls to the point that you are either starring at yourself in closeup or fighting enemies blind.  This gets particularly annoying when fighting multiple enemies.  You don't have time to adjust the camera while fighting.  Just adds to the frustration and gives a strong feeling that the game was never finalized.

3.  Gameplay.  There are 4 basic play modes.  There is the platform game in which you run and jump off walls.  There is the combat sequences, Lightcycle and tank scenes.  The platformer is fun for a while but gets pretty old fast.  Also you will die alot when you try to figure things out.  The developers knew this.  There are no ""lives"" in this game. You have an endless supply so don't worry about dying.  Also there are checkpoints about every 5 feet which at least prevents a lot of unnecessary repetition.  Combat modes are pretty stale.  The game is basically a glorified version of rock paper scissors.  Each enemy has a particular weakness which is one of 4 types of your disk.  Just switch to each type and slam away.  It's not overly challenging.  Basically both the platform and combat modes are just a lot of trial and error.  There isn't an awful lot of variety.  Healing and charging your character is quite ludicrous.  Basically you have to climb on specific walls to heal and vault garbage cans to recharge energy.  This is kind of silly and frustrating in boss fights or even regular combat.  You will find yourself running in circles trying to vault that one garbage can (and often missing in your haste and the camera spinning wildly) while the boss slams away at you.

Tank play.  For a couple segments the game throws you into the famous tank.  These sequences do a little to break up the monotony but overall are pretty blah.  The tank driving controls are abysmal.  I found it virtually impossible to drive the tank straight and even got myself stuck in some instances.  It was quite annoying.  Furthermore these segments were really short anyway.

Light Cycles.  Easily the biggest disappointment in the game.  After watching the movie I felt the very long Light Cycle segment was really pushing to set up the video game.  Well, the Light Cycle segments are easily the worst parts of the game.  Basically the cycle is 3rd person but you run on small fixed tracks.  You fight a handful of other bikes but you basically just kill them with your disk rather than the tail.  Like the rest of the game the cycle segments are basically trial and error.  You race through and try and avoid the obstacles.  The cycle handles worse than the tank.  Turning is slow and clumsy and it is way too easy to over-correct.  Worse, you need to brake ALOT.  Basically the slower you go the better off you are which kind of defeats the purpose haha.

I would imagine most Tron fans will be easily disappointed and outraged over how bad the light cycle segments truly are.  Easily the worst part of the game.

4.  Story and Graphics.  The story is kind of a companion to the movie.  It is not vital to the film however and it takes some liberties.  For those who have seen the film you will be questioning certain aspects as being insanely redundant.  The graphics are pretty nice though.  I was very surprised at how crisp everything was however the environments get very stale.  There isn't much variety just like the movies.  The only really background change is a cheesy gimmick.

The music is excellent.  Just like the film.  One of the best parts of the game.

5.  Multiplayer.  I don't play on Xbox Live so I can't comment on that but you can do multiplayer offline as well.  It's not terribly fun but it does allow you to level your character up which is a bonus.

Overall I found the game to be fun but not so challenging.  The challenge of the game basically was a test of your patience and ability to deal with constantly dying.  There was little challenge in the fun department.  Instead it was all just frustration challenge.  If you love Tron and can handle dying a hundred or so times on stupid jumps then you can handle this game.

Just bear in mind that this is a licensed game and is not particularly deep.  I personally recommend it as a rental, not a purchase.  You will beat it fast and it has little re-playability.  As a bargain game, 20 bucks or under it is recommended.  If the developers had spent a little more time polishing the controls and camera, as well as making the Light Cycle and Tank segments better this game could have been very strong.",Your typical Licensed game.,1294099200,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

Breakdown (1 Awful to 10 Great)
Gameplay: 5
The control scheme is OK and not overly complicated considering the different weapons and spells available. The biggest problem lies with the camera and diversity. The camera provides some awkward moments that can get you killed. It looks as though no one really put any thought into having smooth and seamless movement as a foundation upon which to build this adventure. The repetiveness of the game and the little diversity- or good diversity- in monsters to kill will sour you on this game real quick. Another beef: you cannot save until the end of a level, which will really frustrate you. Multiplayer is a plus. You can have all 4 on one screen at the same time. This, as is the case with similar set ups, can also lead to getting you killed because someone is too far away and you cannot move.
Graphics: 7
The graphics are actually pretty good, tapping into some of the power of the XBOX. It does not suffer with all four players on one screen, either. Perhaps the lone bright spot.
Replay: 5
For all of the reasons listed in the ""Gameplay"" section above and the lack of different game modes or mini-games make this a rental at best. I sold it after only having it 2 weeks.
Overall, I give it a 6 out of 10... again being generous. It does have imaginative ""Boss"" monsters and a somewhat interesting storyline, but this is not a great game and if you like RPGs with scrolling movement, then you probably better stick with Gauntlet.",Disappointing...,1025654400,2,,

The first thing I noticed when I took the controller in my hands is that rough plastic texture. I'm used to the smoother texture of the official controller, and this did not ""feel right"".

Also the contour of the handles is different, it is not designed for larger hands. Basically I hold my Xbox controllers with both hands, and index and middle fingers resting on the shoulder buttons (LT/LB,RT/RB), and the thumbs on left analog, and face buttons (A/B/X/Y) for most games. This one seems to be designed to have your thumb on the left DPAD, and middle and ring fingers on the back buttons. I still had to have my index fingers on the shoulder for better grip. But that means the default back button configuration is not proper (since LB/RB are duplicated). And overall it felt less comfortable on my hand. (Holding it with the regular grip makes the back buttons less than useful, since they stay at a very bad angle, so I assumed that was not the proper way).

The controller is wired, like all non-special purpose third party ones (I only saw special ones like guitars, racing wheels, etc to be allowed on the wireless channel). It seems to use the old Xbox 360 detaching head, in fact it fit very well. The cable itself is nice though, it has a cloth cover for longevity. And it comes with the proper 3.5 audio jack, and does not require a separate adapter like the original controller.

7 Days to Die finds its way to the consoles from the PC so how does it stand-up to other games like it? To preface the review, I'm a huge fan of survival horror and have always wanted an console open world experience. Worrying about zombies, hydration, starvation, sickness, temperature, and bodily injury, all while under the time constraint of a visitation from zombie horde every 7 days is a welcome experience. Especially since there aren't many games on the console market that fit this specific niche, it's a relief to have the title in existence. Working under such conditions is were the game really shines because it forces you to engage with the world to find resources to, for example, remedy a sprained ankle, cure being infected, find food and water, and to find weapons and blueprints/books/schematics to improve your range of crafting. The game also offers co-op online and local split-screen so you don't have to go it alone (local coop is always a plus). Allocating skill points, building a base that can withstand the force of the horde, and grinding for supremacy amongst the forces of the environment are always good fun alone or with company.

I will not mention graphics because gameplay is the core of any GAME.

Now there are numerous problems with the gameplay. The major issues that I and most other people have with this game are the frame rate drops and glitches in the game. There is no reason for a game in 2016 to have the frame rate issues that 7 Days to Die has, especially for a game that has been out for the PC for years. This hampers the gameplay because you can be killed in a heated enemy encounter because the game will momentarily freeze due to frame rate drop. In terms of glitches, there is one really frustrating example I have. You read books/schematics to gain access to crafting of whatever item the book/schematic is for. I've found SMG and Pistol schematics but it doesn't come up in my assemble options. Zombies walking on air, getting wet while your clearly indoors during the rain, falling down ladders when you climb down them, etc.

Combat is another issue in itself. Anything that can be used as a melee weapon struggles in this game. There is a significant lack of hit confirmation while fighting an enemy as enemies or your character don't always react to you actually landing a hit. It creates a gray area of melee combat in which you're wasting stamina swing at the air NEAR the enemy rather than actually landing a hit. I prefer ranged combat personally, however enemies take a decent amount of ammo to take down so using a gun sometimes is not a sustainable way of taking care of business.

Conclusion: it's $30 (or a little less depending on your prime status), it's glitchy, combat can be ineffective at times, but it's honestly good fun with so much potential. Updates are necessary for these issues and for this game to actually evolve into something that it's meant to be.

My recommendation: Follow the road until you find a town. Loot, set up shop, and get ready for the 7th day. Oh yes, always go for the supply drops... always...","With Its Abundance of Issues, It's Still Good Fun",1467676800,4,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'},

I have the second game which I suppose I'll play eventually (I feel no compelling desire to continue the story after completing this game).  Assassin's Creed definately looks good graphically and that must've been what drove the franchise forward because the gameplay/story were rather ho hum.

The premise is that your ancestor's memories are recorded in your DNA, and using a device called an Animus you can relive them.  The story that takes place in modern times was interesting to me, but the dialog that happened back during the crusades wasn't so much...it just felt like inane and overly long chatter.  Anyways, you are sent on missions to assassinate various targets for reasons you kinda discover why as the game plays out.  Portions of the game are walled off, because you supposedly don't have enough mastery over the Animus to activate it.

The achievements are tedious...especially the flag collections (of which you must collect 420 to get all related achievements).  The flags tend to be rather drab and don't stand out to well...as you get closer you may notice some intentional graphical distortions around them.  You could spend years trying to find the flags without using maps available on the internet.  The world seems kinda lifeless to me as well, since other than repetitive quest givers you really don't engage with any of its citizens and once you complete a side quest they disappear never to be seen again.  Shopkeepers would've made the world feel a little more realistic I suppose.

I didn't really care for the walling off of city sections.  Personally, I'd have rather just wondered around wherever I wanted and have the Animus just kick me out every now and then to advance the modern day plot. I don't understand why you had to pass through hostile guards or go out of your way to climb scaffolding to enter a city.  Also as the game moved into the later chapters the difficulty of navigating the cities increased.  As you progress, there seemed to be more and more guards and if you bump them (or are pushed into them) they start a fight with you.  In addition they increased the number of beggars who push you into the guards.  That made the completing timed assassination quests really annoying...especially if you left a pile of bodies from a previous failed mission attempt.

The part of the main assassin story I did like was the challenge presented by figuring out how to use your assassination blade on the main target (which I assume was related to an achievement...but since I didn't do it the other way I don't know if that achievement would pop anyways). Some of the exacting maneuvers to get in position could be frustrating though...especially when your character inadvertently veers off in a direction you weren't going in.  Otherwise I didn't mind that as much as fighting an endless supply of guards while trying to move quickly through the cities.

In summary, the game is okay despite it's annoyances.  I won't spend big bucks to get a copy of the game though...anything sub $20 is a reasonable price for it.",The Creed doesn't live up to the hype,1406764800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

No offense to Naughty Dog but come on, you want us to pay $15 for a DLC that seem incomplete, especially to Ellie's story? And here we are thinking that the audiences get to finally see Ellie's side of the story before the event of the disease spreading. But noooo. Even Sucker Punch's Infamous DLC was way longer and more funner than this junk.

His recent titles like Sonic The Hedgehog for the Xbox 360, and Sonic & The Secret Rings for the Nintendo Wii, haven't made a definitive smash for new gamers and the die hard fans as well. Lately, Sonic has turned his attention to sports games which have worked nicely like Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Games for the Wii and Nintendo DS, as well as Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity for the Playstation 2. The attention has worked quite nicely for a simple twist on the blue need for hedgehog speed. Now, he has turned his sports feats into tennis and hopes to serve an ace in this title.

Sega Superstars Tennis for the Nintendo Wii, brings in a twist by bringing Sonic and his friends from classic Sega franchises into the world of tennis. In the game you can choose from classics like Dr. Robotnik A.K.A. Eggman, Sonic himself, or lesser-known friends from the Sega Universe like Akai from Super Monkey Ball and Amigo of Samba De Amigo from the classic Sega Dreamcast title. The gameplay though falls a bit similar to the Mario Tennis franchise Nintendo has made acceptionally well. The gameplay is simple, as you master you characters through simple tennis. Each character also has a specialty shoot as well, like Dr. Robotnik who throws out spiked bombs at you as he serves his shoot, and Sonic who blazes out his top speed making it impossible to reflect his shot. You can control sonic either through the Wii remote and Nunchuck where you can control your shots like you did in Wii Sports, or use the Wii's Classic controller for those who just aren't acustomed to the control of the game. There are also a few extras mini-games here that also are featured in the game, but nothing side-splitting to making it seperate from the other fantasy tennis titles.

All in all, it is a surprise Sega beat Mario in making a tennis title for the Wii, but Sega Superstars Tennis is a decent game. Sadly though, if you've mastered Mario Tennis from the Gamecube era, or a fan of other titles like Virtua Tennis, than this would be more like a rental than a must have in you Wii library.

I have nothing against woman or woman being in power... but I disliked how this game made it seem like Men can't do anything right and woman have to be the ones to clean up after the mess.
I played the whole game was hoping the game would disprove how I felt, but it didn't, only added more to it.
I don't want to do spoilers and go in more reason why it's gender bias against Men... but the game clearly is bias and I dislike how that it's being ignored.

I just hope the next game can be more fair and show both men and woman can do great things and can be a strong independent person... and both genders can be mean and evil and do really foolish things

Often times there won't be any good camera angel for a shot. You'll have you blindly shoot and hope the ball goes where you want it to. If you move the camera too far away you won't be able to tell the balls appart. Also, the balls fly around the table very unrealistically. Is there grease on the table?

In my opinion, pokemon Black/White was a bit of a let down. The story followed the adventures of a trainer who must complete what is called a ""Pokedex,"" but in lieu of this, must also thwart the evil plots of Team Plasma.

Good enough for me, as all the other games had followed a similar story; However, I believe despite the new additions (pokemon), and beautiful graphics, there was absolutely nothing to consider ""great."" The shortened routes made the game extremely easy and the larger cities contained nothing, but pointless people. (Not to mention, the Elite 4 had an extreme type disadvantage to multiple pokemon found in the game).

I really hated the fact that they basically ""fed"" you along in the game, giving you pokemon and items that helped you progress to the next level without a fight. Not to mention, you couldn't really ""get to know"" your pokemon, because they leveled up so fast (You could be a level 1 and progress to a level 10 in minutes!)

Personally, I didn't feel entitled to ""do anything,"" I didn't even want to complete the pokedex. It was just too easy for me, quite frankly.

I've replayed previous versions recently, and I've found that I still really enjoy them. I don't know what it is about Pokemon Black/White, but I prefer the older games. : )

While I can acknowledge, along with every other gamer, that ""Resident Evil 4"" is a great gamecube title, is the Collector's Tin worth the extra dies dolares (10 bucks in spanish) added from the original price?  That depends.

The Collector's Tin has a solid metal packaging that's looks cool in its overall red pallete with a rough title logo, even though it's not exactly rigid to take on heavy damage, and the ""Gamestop"" logo on the front can be bothersome to look at.  Other than the game itself, the Tin also contains a mini-art book, which is actually a 22-page digest recaping on the past RE games other than an actual art book.  It also includes an authentic cel art of Leon.  Because of the size of the package, however, the cel art is short and the art isn't exactly high-res.  For those who are think about the free soundtrack it offers, BE WARN.  This ""Resident Evil 4"" soundtrack is actually A MUSIC SAMPLER CONTAINING 6 METAL SONGS FROM THE RESIDENT EVIL MOVIES.  So if you're hoping for some ambient tracks from the game, don't bother with this soundtrack offer.

Overall, is it worth it?  Personally, this item doesn't do justice, becuase I thought the Collector's Tin would have more oomph in its inclusions, but what it has, it doesn't offer much.  If you're THAT big of a ""Resident Evil"" fan and the packaging and what it offers looks cool, go ahead and spend it.  Gamers should rather save the ten bucks and get the original game.

Next, I liked way that they set up the map in this game. You had symbols that were on the map depending on where you needed to go next and you just had to follow them to get to the next mission, It reminded me alot of GTA. Another thing i'd like to comment on is the diversity of the missions in this game. they can range from racing, to collecting items, to getting past police barricades. These different types of missions really kept me entertained instead of getting bored with the same types of challenges over and over. One final thing I'd like to add is that i wish jak had a better health. It seemed that jak was extremely easy to defeat and when he gets knocked out you have to start from the very beginning of whatever mission it is that you were on.

It's easy to install or remove, and adds very little bulk to the 3DS.  The 3DS still fits in a case with this on which is a plus.  (It will not fit in the charging dock but that should be obvious) If you're comfortable with the 3DS stock size or just want something to protect from scratches without adding any bulk this is perfect.
  Now lets get to the cons.  The first thing I noticed soon after getting my 3DS is that it is not very comfortable during extended play for those of us with larger hands.  This case doesn't alleviate this problem, and to make matters worse there were several sharp edges that actually started cutting into my fingers.  This was especially an issue around the Left shoulder button. I spent some time with a fingernail file and rounded off all the sharp edges and it was much better, but I still found it uncomfortable to hold, with or without this shell.
  My solution... I decided I should try a grip, and there are several for sale on here but I wanted something fast so I went local.  I went to several stores but I couldn't find a grip anywhere.  What I did find was the Nerf Armor for the 3DS at a game specialty store that I decided to stop at, and decided to give that a shot.  It is by no means perfect but it adds some bulk to the system, it's lightweight, and best of all it fixes the 3DS floppy screen issue.  At this point it seems to be the best option for adding grip and protection to the 3DS, though I still want to try some of the other grips that are on the market.","It's ok, but watch the sharp edges....",1315094400,,,

This isn't so much a game as an interactive video novel.  Most of the game is spent watching the main character, Phoenix Wallis, interview various persons of interest in a murder investigation.  There are red herrings, dead ends, and a side story that has nothing to do with the main murder.

The Good

Story: I liked the way the murder investigation takes place against the backdrop of a different kind of society that is pretty well fleshed-out.  I also liked the side story that was very mysterious and intriguing.

Techniques:  Having a computer in-game that could be used for various types of analysis was really nice. I love doing forensic-type stuff.  I wish I could have used it more often than I was allowed.

Sound and Video: The music and sound effects were good.  Most of the voices were OK to very good.  I liked Phoenix's voice.  The 3D people models were OK, but the faces looked really nice (like photos had been mapped onto the heads).

Diary: I liked the diary that was kept automatically for Phoenix.  It provided clues as well as kept track of tasks that weren't complete.

The Bad

Movement: The movement controls are awful. You have to move the cursor around the screen to find the arrows that allow you to move to another area, except for when you can just click on the ground to walk Phoenix across the room.  It is not always obvious which method you need to use in a given scene. Also, when Phoenix is moving to another area, the view constantly shifts so that you can get really disoriented as to which way she's moving. (In cinema-speak, the camera crosses the line - frequently.)

Puzzles:  The puzzles in the game were mostly ridiculous.  Many of them did not fit the context of the story and seemed to be there only to exasperate the character (or player) for no good reason.  The worst one was having to knock off a section of a wall and then glue it back together so that the bartender would then show up again.  How in the world are you supposed to know you need to do that?

Voices: One of the ... characters ... talked like she was ... reading from ... cue cards.

Interviews: During each interview you are given a list of topics to talk about.  It was often hard to distinguish one topic from another in that there was really no way to know how Phoenix was going to handle the topic.  Sometimes she would act reasonably, rationally; other times she would act almost childish.  As far as I could tell, it didn't really matter all that much which route you picked through a conversation other than maybe it would take fewer or more interviews to eventually get what you needed.  I saved right before one conversation and did it twice in what I thought was two different ways, yet it ended up with the same result.  It would have been nice if it had been possible to screw up a conversation, thereby irritating the interviewee to the point that they refused to talk to Phoenix any more and causing the player to have to find another route to get the needed information.

The Hilarious

* The two free ""makeovers"" that Phoenix can get result in pretty amusing makeup.
* When Phoenix walks/runs around the business district outdoors, she walks/runs backwards!

Summary

If you don't mind sitting through hours and hours of conversation, you will probably like this game since it has such an interesting story.  Be warned that even though you can eventually solve the murder, the story of Phoenix doesn't end here.","Not Bad, Could Have Been Better",1239667200,7,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Enter the Matrix was a highly anticipated movie tie-in that disappointed on every single level, much like the following films in the series.  The biggest complaint from many about the game was that you didn't play as Neo; instead you played as Niobe and Ghost taking place in events surrounding the storylines of the film.  Now, Atari and Shiny have finally answered the prayers of Matrix fans, finally allowing you to play as the savior of mankind, with all his fantastic abilities at your fingertips.  You play as Neo from the beginning as you train your way to becoming ""the One"" by learning to manipulate the Matrix to your advantage.  You are directly in events taken from the film trilogy; from the subway battle to the Burly Brawl to the epic, rain soaked finale against Agent Smith, only this time it has a different ending than that of the film.  The first thing you'll notice is that the game's graphics engine isn't the most attractive one you'll see.  There had to be sacrifices made in order to inject so much into this game, and while the graphics may be jerky, they suit their purpose.  The biggest flaw of Path of Neo is the control scheme.  Basic hand to hand combat is easy enough, but when it comes to the gunplay elements the game suffers mightily.  Between unholstering your weapon, aiming it, and moving around at the same time, you'll be giving your fingers cramps.  This is the biggest drawback of the game and it will turn off plenty, but the ability to pull off some insane combos which can be unlocked throughout make the gameplay rewarding.  Laurence Fishburne is the only cast member from the films to lend his voice to the game, while the likenesses and sound alike voices of Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and the rest of the cast are here.  All in all, Path of Neo isn't the best game to come around, but it's faithfulness to it's source material is refreshing for a licensed game, and it's light years beyond Enter the Matrix.",Finally,1150934400,6,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'}",

I didn't expect it to include the things that would later go into the series such as the charge shot, or Rush or anything like that, but when I first played it, I was flabbergasted by it's extreme difficulty.  As a kid I thought it was a great game.  Now that I'm older, I can look at it with a critical eye and say that it is a good game, but even for an old school gamer, Mega Man is a game that so rightfully needed the remake that it was garnered in the PSP, and was also a game that seriously needed tweaking even when it was first released in the 80's.

As with all old school games of the 8-bit era, Mega Man's focus was not story.  It was gameplay.  Storlyines didn't become important until the 16-bit era.  So if you wanted to know the premise, you needed to read the instruction manual.  Of course, you probably know it without the use of the instruction booklet anyway.

Mega Man's gameplay was pretty simple.  You played as the blue bomber and selected one of six robot masters to go off and face.  You went through the level and would eventually find the robot master and take them down.  Each Robot Master was weak to another Robot Masters weapon.  In the end this proved to be a staple of the Mega Man series.  Each time you defeat a boss, you get his weapon and move on.  Fantastic.

The game was difficult, though.  And when I say difficult, I'm not joking.  For one, you've got no energy tanks, and the energy pellets that restore health are not dropped very often.  Also, there are no passwords so you have to complete the game in one sitting.  Bosses also did a lot of damage to you.  For a series, Mega Man got off to a great start, but as an indiviual game, the fun is actually taken away because of the difficulty (the Yellow Devil comes to mind).  You're not invulnerabe to spikes if you get hit, and there are no energy tanks.  That makes up the bulk of the difficulty.  This probably won't bother those who played the games in order, but I started with Mega Man II.  The other big thing about the difficulty was the Magnet Beam.  You'll have to grab it in order to get further in Wily's fortress, but you don't get it by traditional means.  You have to find it in a level.  This brings about another gripe with the difficulty, if you go back to a level you must fight that Robot Master AGAIN, and you might not be prepared for that.

Music wise I also didn't think highly of the first Mega Man.  A lot of the music just didn't sound fantastic to begin with.  There were some good tunes (Wily's fortress, Cut Man's stage), but there were also tunes I dreaded a lot (Ice Man's stage, the Boss Fight music).  Again, though, this is the first game.  It's just getting things started.

Mega Man is a good game, but the extreme difficulty might be a bit much for even your average old school gamer who's used to such difficult feats.  It's a good game, and it'll probably test your skills more than the likes of Contra.  However, I'm not the kind of gamer who is used to that.  I was able to complete Mega Man, but it's not an easy game.  But I've heard of gamers going through the whole game without getting hit once, which means the difficulty really does provide a lot of fun.","The Start of a Great Series, but with Frustration",1150416000,2,,

But if you have play the previous Sims (The Sims and Sims 2), you are probably having mix feelings about this game as well. You should know I haven't play the previous Sims for a long time, so my memory is a bit foggy about them.

Anyway, I've been playing this game about 2-3 hours/day almost every day in the past couple weeks and here are some things I like about the Sims 3:
1) The ability to freely move your sim anywhere on the map. Your sim is no longer contained into one lot.
2) The ability to customize majority of your items (by meaning customize, I mean choosing your own colors).
3) Ability to place your stuff on an angle (I think you were able to pl
4) You can add your own mp3 to the custom music folder located in ""My Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Custom Music"" But to hear your mp3, you have to buy a radio.
5) Ability to become business partners of various businesses and if you like, own the business as well. Purpose of this: To earn more money and if you like, make your Sim quit his/her job. However, to collect the money made by the business, you have to click on the building to get it.
6) Jobs or careers you take are a little more complicated. It has it usual get to work and develop skills, but what else is added is options on what you want to do at work. You can work casual, work hard, socialize with co-workers, and some other options related to your job. From time to time, you will get pop ups about opportunities relating to your job to advance your Sim. By completing this opportunity, you will either earn more money per hour worked or gain new skills.
7) New skills to develop. I think they are gardening, fishing, and writing? By developing your skills, you can do more things with your new skills. For example, if you study mechanic long enough, you will eventually be able to upgrade things. You can make items unbreakable or make improvements to it.
8) You have the option to have life change around you. For example, your neighbors may move and new ones may move in. Friends will age and eventually die. I'm not quite sure if Sims start disappearing in your game because they are dead, will new ones take place for them or do you have to create new Sims to populate your town?

And here's what I don't like:
1) You can't make your own custom size lots. You have to use what is given to you. You can build stuff on existing lots, but you can't make new lots and place it somewhere on the map. If there is an option to do that, I must be blind or something because I can't find the button to make a new lot.
2) I preferred that the Sim get in the car and then backup rather than going to the street and pushing a button to have the car appear right in front of them.
3) I rather hire a gardener (which there is no service for) than having my Sim take care of the garden every day.
4) I rather have a nanny that watch the kids at a schedule time than calling a babysitter every day.
5) Guitar is nice to play, but I also want a piano!
6) I haven't been able to get my Sims to marry. Both my Sims are in love, but there's no option to get them married? They can make babies, but no option for wedding. They talk and kiss every day. One time, I had them chat and make out all day long. Still no option to get married! What does it take to make these 2 sims get married? Maybe they should of added a church in the game where sims can get married.
7) Is there an option to build your own town?
8) I don't like the fact if you play one household, it will affect all the other households. Life will progress for all the sims. If you choose to play another household and then go back, you may find that life has change. Of course, you have the option to disable story mode. For me, I left it on to see how this game will progress.
9) Not much items to choose from. They sure have lots of different kinds of bookshelves!
10) Some buildings you can't even explore in such as the Stadium, Hospital, Theater, Town Hall, Police Station, etc. I'm interested what it look like inside!

In summary, The Sims 3 has new features, but they also took out some old ones from previous Sims. Quite frankly, I'm already bored with this game after 2 weeks of playing. I think the Sims 2 was more fun to play with.",Mixed review on this game,1245110400,3,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

Sure, the graphics are ""improved"" (if you can really call it that) on the PS4.  I just got my PS4 last week, and it's tough to really see any sizeable difference between my PS3 Arkham games and this one.  The Batmobile is a nice inclusion, but I think it was poorly conceived.  The controls are a little wonky, and the physics engine for that segment of the game has gotta be cheaply built or designed.  It just doesn't feel right to me, and that feeling is reflected in how I command the car to move within the game.  Something is just ""off"".  I can't quite put my finger on it.

I actually enjoyed Arkham Origins a helluva lot more than this game, to be dead honest.  AO had a decent premise with actual boss battles (hint:  Arkham Knight doesn't have any actual villain boss battles in it!!!  Big deduction right there).  A few elements from AO were also incorporated into this game (Riddler henchmen interrogations, cryptographic sequencer segments, etc.).  Overall, the gameplay mechanics of Arkham Knight are not significantly different from the rest of the games in this series.

As far as the story itself goes, like I said..Arkham Origins and the previous titles had a better story.  I'm very glad that The Joker still continues to play a major role in this game, even though he got killed off in Arkham City.  But Scarecrow?  I never liked that character.  It's more believable for someone to dress up like a deranged clown and start psychotically murdering people than for someone to concoct a fear toxin and massively dispense it on a city-wide scale.

One final note (and this is worthy of a full star deduction, hence the title of my review):  WHERE IS ALFRED?  I mean, how come you don't actually meet him within the game?  He's your butler, for god's sake!  Someone who has been by your side since you were a little kid.  You would think that we could actually see Alfred within the game instead of on your arm video thing.  And to go with that, WHERE IS THE BATCAVE???  The PS4 is a more advanced system than the PS3...you would think that the developers could have incorporated the Batcave in here somewhere with all the space they have to work with.  At least Arkham Origins had the d*mn Batcave.  It's ridiculous.

This game really is a mixed bag so I'll mix both good and bad:
The game does bring back much of the old style of game play ""feels"" more like old MK.  What doesnt feel like old MK are the fatalities which are in some cases just very lame and tame to get the ""T"" rating.  They also added some ""test your might"" mid game mini games along with the ""falling combat"" or whatever they call it which really become annoying after a few plays as they really aren't determined by skill, but rather by who smashes more buttons or who ""guesses"" the next move correctly.

Most of the DC characters are done well, some more than others.  The Joker for example was done to perfection as is a lot of fun.  The roster overall is medium sized but lacks the ""mystery"" feel the MKs had as far as hidden characters and the like go as everything that is in there looks to already be there.

The really TERRIBLE part of the game is the hit detection.  Its broken.  Very broken.  It can get real bad online when a roundhouse to someones head goes right through them, uppercuts hit the person standing behind you, people go flying in the wrong direction, and specials go right throw someone who was standing still in front of you.

I could go on and on about the hit detection problems, but we'd be here forever.

What I must say, must say is that Final Fantasy series does separate itself from rest of RPGs out there with the excellent graphic, skillfully done music score, and last but not least, story line.
However, FF8 was something different from rest of FF series.  For couple hours, I thought it was good, then it became apparent eventually that the game doesn't live up to its legacy.  I easily stopped playing it because simply the magic it used to pull me in from FF series wasn't there anymore.  I didn't think the plot was something which i would go 'wow' nor characters were fresh visually for being realistic rather than super-deformed, but other than that there was nothing, nada.
Personally I love Dragon Warrior series.  It doesn't boast any graphic, nor has well plotted story lines of FF series, but Dragon Warrior does a really excellent job in game play balance.
The FF series was able to go head to head, shoulder to shoulder with ENIX because of their graphic, music, and storyline.  But this time, it was way out of its own league.  Graphic was good enough, music, however, didn't give that masterful feeling, and ultimately storyline was just,,,horrible.
It's a decent RPG.  However, I would consider it as a failure from FF's perspective.  I really did expect alot from FF8 since the main theme is love.  I really did anticipated alot...

There are many, older reviews that give a lengthy synopsis. There is a serious departure from RE1 to RE5. Your foes, much like RE4, are fast moving monster men, not slow moving zombies. They can drive cars and motorcycles, operate heavy machinery and unlike Chris Redfield, they can shoot their guns while they're doing it - yes, you read that correct, shoot their zombie guns. RE4 started the trend and RE5 completes the transition from survival horror, the term RE coined, and has become a straight forward action game.

The graphics and presentation are dynamite. The visuals top to bottom are incredible. The creatures look awesome and the bosses can be very intimidating (although the end boss was dissapointing, to say the least). RE5 is probably one of the top 5 best looking games ever, it's that good.

Here's where it all comes apart for me. I just completed Uncharted 2. The controls are amazing, as well as the visuals. Much like Metal Gear Solid, there is a control scheme in place, that at this point in videogames is unacceptable. I can't walk and shoot? I can't walk and swing a knife? I can't run away from enemies and reload? Chris Redfield and Sheva (his counterpart) move like they have a piano on their back. Perhaps Capcom was unable to create a graphics engine that could provide the visuals and keep up with a run and gun gameplay. Maybe they were trying to make it ""scary"" becuase you can't escape (or aim. Maybe they are holding on to tradition. One thing is for sure, they have a weapons and inventory system that is lame and the combat cannot keep up with games like Killzone, Gears of War or Uncharted when it comes to gameplay AND great grapchics combined.

I actually grabbed two copies at a local video retailer so that my teenage son and I could play together. It worked very well and made several areas relatively simple to clear becuase both of us were competent players. Neither of us joined anyone else online, but I imagine the quality of play would have a lot to do with the person on the other end.

RE5 is worth a rental, but I just can't understand why they chose a control scheme that takes so much away from the game. With Dead Space nicely filling the survival horror void, I don't mind the direction of the storyline, but its quality isn't much better than the movies at this point.

This is a fairly decent space combat sim that looks and feels like a retro-styled  Wing Commander 6, which is hardly surprising considering the source. No new  ground is really being broken here in the way that FreeSpace 2 did, with  its massive capital ship combat and nebula missions.
The graphics are  good, and I got great framerates on my Celeron 400 with TNT2 graphics card.  However, there's really heavy distance filtering applied to the textures on  the ships, so if a ship isn't right in your face, it looks like a  brown-grey blob. This is particularly bad because the game relies heavily  on in-engine cutscenes, which come out looking awful this way. You also  can't skip the cutscenes, which is completely annoying.
The fighter ship  design is very cool--they all look like vicious WWII fighters--but the  capship design isn't nearly as good, with one or two exceptions. Capship  combat and anti-capship missions are a big letdown when compared to  FS2.
As others have stated, the AI is profoundly stupid, and your options  for controlling them are very limited. You're basically alone out  there.
The flight model is also weird. You lose turning maneuverability  when you slow down, which is the opposite of most space sims. This makes  the game into a lot of high-speed passing and turning with a great deal of  gunfire, as the ships don't mount many missiles (and the missiles are both  easily evaded and usually ineffective), and there's no standard rearming  in-mission.
What does make the game replayable is cooperative  multiplayer, which you can play on the Zone--you can replay any of the  campaign missions with others.
Deathmatch multiplayer is a different  story, however. There are a lot of fun variants on deathmatch, but the  actual playing of it is bad. There's a great deal of lag warping and other  weirdness in deathmatch, even if you have a blazing connection to the net.  You'll explode without even knowing you were being shot at; you'll get  killed by the guy that you are drilling right in front of you because he  has actually come around behind you and shot you, only you never saw that  updated on your screen. So deathmatch becomes far less skill than luck, and  not very fun.
Conclusion: you might have some fun with this if you're  bored and looking for a new space action fix, but don't expect it to be the  Next Great Thing, as it's pretty much more of the same. If you've never  played FreeSpace 2, you owe it to yourself to check that out first before  committing to Starlancer.
One final note: The force feedback on this game  is absolutely the best I've ever experienced. It almost is reason alone to  try out the game. For the first time, force feedback actually figures  prominently in the gameplay; you hesitate to turn on certain weapons  because your stick will be shaking so hard you won't be able to hit the  target. It definitely adds a lot of fun factor to the flying. I wish other  games' implementations of force feedback were as good.",It's so-so.,959212800,4,,

Gameplay: This is what I am highly disappointed with. The gameplay from 2003 was good, but not great. And I was looking forward to the gameplay tweaks. But I was wrong. The physics many have complained about have gone from bad to worse. EA Sports overemphasized the ""realistic"" physics engine. So basically what I am trying to say is that it is much more difficult to master than last years version and if you are not racing in Daytona or Talladega, good luck. The physics engine will make you skid out of control if you go into a corner too fast. A good attempt to improve the game was the in-game rivalries in Career mode. Unfortunately, with the horrid physics, you will most likely do a lot of bumping + grinding with opponents, therefore making many enemies in the locker room, which means you will have an early exit in most races when your enemies come hunting you down.
Career Mode: It practically remains unchanged from last year. But this isn't NHL 2003 were taking about here. Last year, it had one of the best career modes available. And I can accept that. There were a few tweaks to polish the overall performance. Like a guide to newcomers and the R+D has evolved letting you choose what you research. But I'll be looking for some improvements in this area next year.
Graphics + Sound: These two things remain unchanged from 2003, but these were pretty good last year also so they don't have to worry about that, there are more teacks on the game, but these basically have to do with Alternative Rock, but if your not a fan of Alternative, this game does allow for custom CD's.
Final Verdict: I am rather disappointed with this game, I was looking forward to a good game this year, but itll have to wait till 2005. If you are interested in 2004, rent it first. If you like it, then buy it. If not, there will probably be a 2003 version available for 20 bucks, so invest in that then.",Potential gone to waste,1069632000,10,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

If getting stuck at that end of each level, trying over and over and over and over, etc. to go on to the next level, is your cup of TEA.  If Not Go back to Unreal Tournament 2004, is still the best FPS game ever made.  There are still LOTS of people hosting the game and lots of players on some sites, PLUS you can play Single Player Instant Action games on any downloaded maps, setting the skill levels of the AI's where you want.  I warn you on UT2004 you do not want to set the skill level of the AI's on the highest setting unless you like losing.

3.0,False,"10 18, 2003",ASU3THM5ZUTUI,B00008URUF,Mark Lee,"When it was first released for the Super NES in 1994, ""Donkey Kong Country"" set the world on fire.  Astonshing ACM graphics, stereo sound, awesome music, and just plain FUN gameplay quickly made it one of the best-selling platform action games of all time.  It later spawned two sequels, plus a 3-D version for the Nintendo 64, and each sequel got progressively better as the years went by.
Now we have the convenient travel size version of the adventures of Donkey and Diddy.  We have all the same unique levels, heroic Kongs, cute animal buddies, evil Kremlings, and other all-too-familiar enemy creatures.  The graphics are not nearly as detailed as they are on the SNES version, but the backgrounds are still beautiful and the landscape of the levels still shows a lot of the original drawing (especially the levels in ""Gorilla Glacier""); and the sound is not nearly as crisp, but players can still tell how catchy the tunes are and how well they fit each scenario.  (Who could forget the all-time classic jungle music, or bonus area music?)
Of course, this is all expected when you make a portable version of one of the greatest games ever.  Unfortunately, there is a major flaw with this portable game: even with all the original levels, the game is now way too easy.  Much, much, much easier than the original game ever was.
One of the silliest new features added to this game is that when you save your game, you save the number of lives you have as well.  This is especially dumb when you take in the new Mini-game features: six difficulty levels each of a fishing game and a dancing game.  If you've played ""Dance Dance Revolution"" before, you should be able to win 3 extra lives every time you play any level on the dancing game; if not, keep trying, there are no rhythms harder than quarter notes.  Fishing is just dropping a hook into the sea and trying to catch the right types of fish; you don't even have to try to reel in the fish since the game automatically does it for you.  The only level on the fishing game that I didn't beat on my first try was the ""Gorilla Glacier"" one, where you had to catch 50 jellyfish in the allotted time.
Also, you are allowed to call Funky's Flights anywhere you want, so you can go back and play easy levels to get tons of extra lives there.  This works even if you haven't found Funky in the hardest area you reached, so you basically go and get tons of extra lives any time you want even if the mini-games bore you to tears.
Another easy way to repeatedly get extra lives is with Golden Animal tokens; every time you get three, you can enter a bonus area where you get another life for every 100 little tokens you collect (my record: 1138 in the Expresso one).  You could do this as often as you wanted in the original too, but this game saves your tokens, so you often start the game with two of one type of token, and then you may end up going to the corresponding bonus area without even planning on it.
But no matter how you play, you'll find it really easy to keep winning lives over and over again.  You'll be up to 99 lives before you know it.  Although the game does give you a Hero Mode once you've beaten it--where you can only play as Diddy and have no checkpoints in the levels--you still can save your progress with a huge number of lives, so any difficulty added to the levels quickly gets canceled out. (Oh, and one more really stupid addition is that if you've beaten a level, you can do the START+SELECT trick to escape from the level when you die, EVEN IF THE DEATH ANIMATION AND MUSIC HAS ALREADY STARTED, and you still won't lose a life!  It's a really cheap way to save yourself from losing lives when you don't have to.)
But apart from being able to survive infinitely, there is an even bigger problem regarding difficulty; the difficulty of finding all the secrets has been significantly diminished as well.  One of the best features of the original game was that there were tons of bonus areas full of great items.  The easiest ones to find were hidden in doors that had to be broken with a barrel, but the more secretive ones were in barrels that were hidden off the screen, and often players had to risk jumping into oblivion in hopes of finding a hidden bonus area.  The portable game has flattened and shrunk the screen down to an uncomfortable size, and now the ""hidden"" bonus barrels are often in plain view!  There's no more fun in trying to find the ""hidden"" bonus areas, because now, you can see them all!  And even if you don't see the *barrel* itself, you often can still see a trail of bananas leading to the barrel, and even these were carefully hidden from view in the original as well.
""Donkey Kong Country"" will always be one of the most brilliant games ever made.  I haven't stopped playing the original game since it first came out.  But I felt like putting down the travel-size version in a month, simply because it had so much fun and challenge taken away that it really didn't do justice to the SNES version.  The game gets 3 stars for remaining faithful to the original with all the same graphics, music, characters, and levels; in fact, this is where the most of the fun in this GBA version comes from.  If Rare hadn't at least done this, I would easily have given the game 2 stars, or possibly even 1.","An all-time classic, unfortunately, is now way too easy.",1066435200,8,,

I am a huge fan of this game. I loved the first one. I rated it a 3 out of love for the genre. If I was to rate it for the average video game player out there...I would give it 2 stars.

I dealt with the bugs, graphics, key binding, and weird crash problems! It became PLAYABLE on PC after the very last patch was released. My girlfriend and I played CO-OP via LAN and had a blast. This game kind of has a cult following. Many people did not like the first one. Those that did (like me) dearly hoped that the Ryder White DLC would be improved and make up for it. Well, that was a huge let down and angered even more people. So, we held off and kept our hopes high that Deep Silver would pay attention and learn from their mistakes, polish the rough edges and make RIPTIDE into a diamond. Instead, what we have is the EXACT same product, just slightly changed.

As far as anyone can tell (players, mag and website reviewers) there are no improvements!
1-The game engine itself is the problem. Deep Silver obviously took the lazy road, saved money and recycled the old engine...rust and all.

2-The FOV(field of view) is fixed at 62.5! Do you like getting sea sick or nauseous in front of your monitor? My girlfriend almost got sick from the 62.5 FOV! The original game did this. I just assumed that it would have been fixed! It wasn't. And with a simple bit of searching online, I saw all the other players in forums complaining about it too, talking about getting sick, not being able to play it. Everyone was manually tweaking their settings. Deep Silver says they cannot do this, that there are 'reasons' for the game to be in 62.5 FOV mode! Then why is it that we can adjust it ourselves by editing your darn files DS and stop the nausea and enjoy the game? Why didn't you spend the past 19 months fixing a problem you knew had a huge effect on players that was clearly documented in your own forums?!

3-Random crashes STILL occur like the old game!

4-The graphics are not any better! You would think they would have made improvements in this area considering they had over 19 months to do it and had Far Cry 3 setting the standard of what a tropical environment should look like.

5-The in game menu allows only the modest minor and minimal video adjustments.
If you want to adjust common settings that OTHER PROFESSIONAL GAME DEVELOPERS let you adjust - like FOV, Filtering, VSYNC and FSAA, etc. - you have two choices - roll up your sleeves and literally edit files with notepad then set them to READ ONLY or the game will change everything back or use a tool like Dead Island Helper(Google it)! How insane is that in this day and age?
By the way, the engine of this game actually has forced settings that literally are making your video card work harder than it has to! Example - VSYNC. By not being able to easily adjust your VSYNC and having to manually edit files or use tools, your video card spends a tremendous amount of energy constantly compensating for it being incorrect..producing unnecessary wear and heat on your card.

6-Zombies can ONE HIT KILL YOU! Yep, you read that right...you can hack and slash away at a zombie and it can that beating...but if you see a zombie holding an object (even though 75% of the time you never do see it)you better kill it first or get ready to dodge but mostly just get ready to die! Why? Because apparently zombies are expert marksman with thrown weapons in Deep Silver's world. One hit and you die, even with perfect full health! Check the forums...there are droves of players totally Peeved off about this! I have no doubt Deep Silver knows they are in Deep STUFF over this and will patch it eventually. The problem is DS is known to be glacially slow about fixing things and patching.

7-There are a couple of new zombies and some new weapons. Still the game is 99% recycle original Dead Island...bugs and all. Which is a true and total shame! I believe this game is very close to being a diamond and could become a healthy and profitable franchise for DS if they would just put in the effort to polish the edges and get it to shine the way it should. There truly is diamond potential here.

8-Not sure about AMD but if you have NVIDIA like I do, you will need to download the latest BETA drivers to get DI:Riptide to run correctly...or at least you can hope!

Well, I could go on, but the list is long. Too long for this review. I think I made the point though.

Am I playing it? Yes. Single Player and Co-op. Am I having fun? Sort of. Part of me wants to stop and just wait for the next patch or two. This game is a hit or miss though. What I mean is that you might have a great experience with it on your PC, but many people are not.

Here is what I recommend -
WAIT! DO NOT BUY IT! In another month (or maybe 2 or 3 months) there will be patches from Deep Silver and the public community will provide better mods or tweak guides and tools to help it perform better and provide a more pleasant experience. Plus, the price will be better. I do not consider $40 (current price) to be a bad deal though. It's May, and a couple of popular games are out/coming. These will keep you busy. And you can always go back and revisit games you haven't played in a while. I am replaying Bioshock 1 and 2 and GTA IV - EFLC again and with my new vid card, the graphics are stunningly beautiful and exciting in a whole new way!

As I disclosed, I am a fan of this game so I am biased. My girlfriend and I have been enjoying this game. I am not complaining or angered so much as I am disappointed. Out of love for this game I expected a heck of a lot more than Deep Silver delivered, which is why my criticism is written here. It is my challenge to DS to get it together, to rise to the occasion and do better!

UPDATE 1 -
Other things I should have mentioned.

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT - this is still an ugly nightmare! Let's say you have 10 molotovs and want to store 5 and keep 5. There is no way to do it. All or nothing. In the original DI game, carrying too many of the same items would cause problems. Don't know about Riptide. So far, so good but I keep storing my items if they get over 30 or more.

Weapons are still mostly white! The old game was jammed with too many white weapons and not enough of the unusual or rare kind. So far, this is STILL a problem. The vendors are not offering much for variety either.

LOCKPICK SKILLS still not worth it. In the first game you had to spend skill points on lockpicking if you wanted to open locked crates. If you did this, you regretted it dearly because you never got anything good from those crates. The same is true for Riptide. I have yet to get a single worthwhile weapon from the locked crates even though there are many more of them to find and unlock. UGHH!",RECYCLED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1367280000,3,,
3.0,False,"01 8, 2017",A2V8T44BL3CFD5,B017Y97NHM,C.S.L,"Special Note: my review and experience is completely based on the 2012 PS Vita original. If Sony does a Remaster of it's other PS Vita exclusive IPS like Soul Sacrifice/Soul Sacrifice: Delta and Freedom Wars i'll be sure to do the same thing for them and edit my review based on the new PS4 experience once i've had my time with them.

Side Note: My review is off the beaten trail and goes against the grain of this 5 Star over praise this game has gotten. Please read forward with an open mind and a reasonable point of view. It's also mostly spoiler free.

Story ""Flawed with plot holes and a cliff hanger ending""

If I recall correctly the game ends on a cliff hanger and the overall plot has many off screen stuff that was never shown. from a story perspective it was enjoyable mainly for the concept of the interesting world, as for the plot central characters very little was explained and i feel they did this poorly compared to say the Infamous series, a Sony IP brother title to this game in a way of open world.

I will say this though... Kat is a likable character and that coming from a guy like me holds foundation. Why do I say this? Because I hate female protagonists with a passion normally. BUT this is one of my very few exceptions, due to her down to earth (punz cuz yenno gravity) personality neat lookin' side kick black cat that looks like outter space is cool. I will praise the developer that Sony hired to make this game for actually making me not bitter and cynical towards a female protagonist for once. I like her so much... given the art style I low key like her more than Zelda and equally as much as Link from the Legend of Zelda series... credit where it's due, she's a neat chick.

My other favorite character in the story is Syd... but mainly because the community believes him to be the main antagonist for the first half of the game ""Alias"" or at least that's what theories suggested in the 2012 original PS Vita game. Syd himself is a mundane goon with no special powers to speak of, he's basically the equal to Cole's fat friend from the original InFamous series, i forget his name. Important to the overall story but does nothing truly significant which upsets me because I was hoping we'd have some solid male representation in this game for guys like me to relate to but Syd is the closest thing we get to that unfortunately.

Raven is the other gravity shifter in the story but plot wise it doesn't make sense, but since this is a spoiler free review i won't say why. I like her design FAR better than Kat's easily but her personality reminds me of a female Edge Lord which bothers me a little, I don't mind it when male characters are Edge Lords but when a female character does it it's not my cup of tea. I love her full on gothic attire though, she reminds me if Shadow the Hedgehog became a human and got gender bent.

Aside from these 4 characters in the main plot the others are all forgettable, there is a certain other character i could mention but i really hated her because it was not needed to add 3 girls as the main spot light attention of some significance to the story. the director could have easily give that role to a male version to even out the cast of characters a little but no. i really hated this character as a result. also her design was horrible.

Anyway the cliff hanger ending was most likely one of the worst parts about this game if you wanted to experience a full and complete story you're not getting that here. Back then a lot of us assumed it would have ended at GR1 because at the time it wasn't very much well known but it eventually gained much praise and spotlight by Kat even making into that PlayStation Heroes Super Smash Brothers type game as a new Sony IP character along side Cole, Kratos and Nathan Drake.

Combat ""It's ok sometimes but wonky""

The other main issue with this game is the combat, it was wonky on the PS Vita version, the inconsistent frames per second really ruined the experience in some of the later levels with lag and combos just didn't feel satisfying to do. the super moves were even kinda bland but were decent enough, nothin too flashy.

1. Ground Combat plain and simple is lackluster there was obviously not much thought put into hand to hand combat for Kat since she only really uses her legs to do battle and even then they feel weak and carry little to no weight, the experience of ground combat is not a very organic one. she also has very few combos i mean VERY few it was honestly underwhelming this is a point i do see some people in the community point out yet they still give the game a 5 star rating is beyond me.

2. Gravity Combat is neat it feels floaty for a reason because of gravity but for once this is a good thing, it feels very organic and real if a person used gravity in real life in a very casual way. my only beef with it is the fact Gravity Kick is literally the only viable move and that get's annoying when they could have added more combos during gravity based combat.

Graphics/Art ""For the PS Vita in 2012? Great!""

The graphics of this game at the time of 2012 is great plain and simple, on a hand held at the time graphics of this level was either rare or outright unheared of altogether. However the PS4 -Remaster- I am having higher hopes for with the much better hardware and horsepower the PS4 has over the PS Vita which had a power level somewhat lower than a PS3.

The Art style is a weird mixture of French Comic and Japanese anime. And yenno? It works. Which is why it makes me upset we don't have a cool male character to relate with in the story at all because with this art style it's a waste of a potentially cool guy to get in on the action, really makes me irritated but oh well, maybe in Gravity Rush 2 we'll finally get a male gravity shifter like how InFamous First Light got a female conduit. I'm all for equality and not feminist agenda stuff so maybe one day we'll get a male gravity shifter or somethin' like it.

Music ""Beautiful and very European""

I swear the music in this game reminds me of France and Italy. It was one of my favorite osts only being dethroned by the other 2 big fresh/new Japanese made PS Vita exclusive ips called ""Soul Sacrifice & Soul Sacrifice: Delta"" and ""Freedom Wars"" I call these games the big 3 of the PS Vita because they were literally the foundation and peak of prime of Japanese games on the hand held platform before Sony abandoned support in the US mostly.

The OST of this game is so great it's still in my top 10 of all time, below the two mentioned above of course but the fact i put it in the same list as not only Soul Sacrifice and Freedom Wars but also as Dark Souls 3 and a certain new legendary entry in the FF series speaks volumes in itself. To this day I still find it incredibly weird that a project with i assume a limited budget scale somehow managed to have an amazing original soundtrack.

Value ""PS Vita version (2012)? Not much value, PS4 Remaster (2016) however...""

This game wasn't long, if I recall correctly it launched for $40 brand new via PSN and everywhere else. And to be honest that price point is a little over what it's actually worth, even with the new PS4 Remaster $30 is pushing it for me even knowing it has all the included DLC... $20 sounds about right given the overall quality of the product. But I have yet to play the Remaster for PS4 yet so i'll hold my judgements for later since it's only fair. But the original was 50% over priced in my book and the DLC I bought on top of that for the game what little it had made it even worse. I regret buyin' the DLC even more now since the Remaster has it included on the Disc itself.

Pros |
+ Creative and beautiful world
+ ""Ok"" 3 Star worthy story
+ Interesting Protagonist (Kat + Dusty)
+ Interesting Antagonist (Alias... = Syd?)
+ Great French/Italian fairy tale OST

Cons |
- Mundane combat
- Lackluster controls
- Frames Per Second (Lag) problems in later levels
- Story suffers from numerous plot holes, off screen drama and a cliff hanger ending
- No male protagonist or at least cool male rival/side kick for representation purposes

Conclusion | Overall the game is ""Ok"" I didn't really like it or dislike like it. it was an okay experience. I'm honestly just sick of the over praise it's getting from it's community which is somewhat large now even if they are low key, my original PS Vita review was 4 stars but since then I've become very bitter with some social and ethical topics and it's effected my outlook on games and other entertainment. But even with my bitter and cynical point of view on these topics I must give credit where it's due and say Gravity Rush is a unique experience worthy of your time.

PS4 Remaster Note: This review is 95% my opinion on the original 2012 PS Vita release on day 1 almost 4 and a half years ago. I will update my new impressions with the PS4 -Remaster- Edition later on when I've had my time with the game to give a new fair review to best represent this version of the game. I have high expectations because I heard they increased and locked the new frames per second to 60 and all DLC is included free from the original so I predict i'll give this game at least a bumped up 4 star rating base on those facts.

Edit 1: Did some spelling corrections and put a note that i'll update my review as a both a fan and mainly Critique for the PS4 -Remaster- because I have beef with the gravity rush community saying this game is and i quote ""so underrated"" and ""niche"" when the positive feedback is overwhelming both on Amazon.com and the PlayStation community lobby areas on PS4 and forums.

It offers a fun diversion in short spurts, but gulp down too much at a time and you're sure to be hit by the numbing repetition of it all.
You're cast as Caim, a wounded hero who makes a pact with a wounded dragon and ultimately sets out to rescue his sister, the goddess Furiae. Does that mean Caim is a god himself? Apparently not. And who captured Furiae? A nameless Empire with secret intentions that ultimately translate into ""ruling the world."" Some other characters come into the mix, but few of them (despite their extensive biographies in the instruction manual) play into the events of the game in any way that justifies their inclusion. In other words, if you're seeking a game with a good story, ""Drakengard"" is perhaps the last place you should look. Despite this, it doggedly attempts to tell a story in long, painfully written cut-scenes that ultimately prove incoherent. At least the rendered movies make for some spectacular eye candy, even if they fail to shed any light on the unintelligible plot. The opening cinematic is sure to fire your blood and whet your appetite for the game that follows...
...And the game that follows starts out at a rapid clip, thrusting you into the thick of a siege. You'll wonder almost immediately why you're the only warrior fighting against the Empire even as beleaguered (and apparently invisible) soldiers cry out for assistance. For a game that wants so desperately to stick you square in the middle of a battle royale fantasy style, the lack of allies is a glaring omission. Even if battling comrades were nothing save window dressing, it would have helped to immerse you. As it stands, the action is still furious and fairly engaging. Blood spurts are satisfying, but more so the way your weapons send your enemies soaring in waves (like Sauron in the opening of Peter Jackson's take on ""The Fellowship of the Ring""). You only have a few moves at your disposal, so like everything in ""Drakengard"" it eventually wears thin, but it's good fun for a while.
The monotony of ground combat is broken up by... well, the monotony of aerial combat. This is, in my opinion, the weakest aspect of the game. Caim battles a host of foes from astride his fire-breathing dragon, but the dragon's limited abilities and some poor camera work ultimately weaken the experience. On top of that, the enemies displayed in this mode make no logical sense. It's hard to get excited about frying giant bats and winged chests-of-drawers with the same molten breath over and over and over again. Boss battles, at least, liven things up - and all of them take place in the sky.
""Drakengard"" claims to be an RPG, but there's no actual roleplaying. The stats included are useless and amount to nothing, which is just fine since this is clearly an action game - but why the false claims? I don't know. Ignore them. ""Drakengard"" is as deep as kiddy pool, but it's good for a splash every now and again. Missions objectives are never diverse enough to make one mission feel any different from the last. The scenery changes, but the graphics (all but the main character models) are bland as dirty dishwater, and scenery ""pop in"" is a noticeable (and laughable) issue. The game's soundtrack is certainly different, but it tends to perfectly mimic a cat being repeatedly slammed against a pole while Gregorian monks chant in the background. This is not helped by the constant babbling of your ""companions,"" who consistently spout misplaced and distracting anti-wisdom when you'd rather focus on the task at hand.
All in all, it's worth playing if you don't ask too much from your gaming - but wait until it goes down in price before you invest.

It's been over a month since release and there are still glitches abound.  I suggest waiting until this game is fixed.  This game is UNPOLISHED.  A list of few glitches I've encountered:
1. game froze once but did not have the fatal game ending glitch
2. whenever using the fast travel, the audio/visual do NOT sync up
3. lag while using fast travel....I'm talking several minutes until fast travel ends and I continue game
4. audio volume fades in and out, from normal volume to very low volume where I couldn't hear anything
5. broken combat system not registering counters, attacks, etc
6. game freeze looking for multiplayer game
7. when restarting a predator sequence, the new environment shown signs of use....vents and walls not resetting from where I took down enemies, 2 enemies I took out on previous attempt not respawning

That being said, yes this game is a lot of rehash from Arkham city in regards to abilities, Riddler ""trophies,"" and random objectives.  The devs did create an awesome Gotham city.  One that I feel would make Tim Burton proud.  I did enjoy the story line enough.  Some say it was bland and I can see that, but PERSONALLY I found it enjoyable enough.  The only thing that took away from my enjoyment is the broken combat system which makes some Dark Knight achievements even more difficult to achieve, (20 crit strikes in a single free flow combat sequence which breaks when I get hit from counter not working properly).  Enemies fall down way too often and get back up way too slowly breaking your combat flow. This is a very combat heavy game. Also enemies don't respawn inside buildings which limits the very FEW predator rooms even more. Predator sequences are some of the funnest parts of the Batman games.

I can endure the glitches I have endured but others have had game crashing/ending glitches that literally make them start the game from scratch and I can honestly understand why. I say wait until the game is fixed before purchase and it will be a good game worth buying then.

But if you were turned off by FFXI by concept or by actually playing it then avoid this game. It is a departure to the old traditional FF's. It's not bad but it's sooo boring.

The intro was great and it makes you feel like you are in for a treat but then when you pass the prolouge and get into the game you are left battling in drab places and stuck doing fetch quests. You go around in sewers and dungeons for about 10 hours then you get to go to the desert and wonder around there for a while.

I have always prized the extremely high quality and durability of every piece of Nintendo hardware I have owned over the years, no one does it better in my opinion. I did not hesitate to pre-order a launch system for Christmas, Nintendo's hardware is generally bulletproof. I figured Nintendo's quality testing is so high, the Wii U would be immune to the widespread launch failures that plagued the Xbox 360 (RROD) and original PS3 (YLOD), etc. Therefore, I was shocked and disappointed when I set up my kids new Wii U and the gamepad (not the console) started freezing every 15-20 seconds. I did the initial update (took forever), it did not help a bit. I spent countless, frustrating hours trying every fix on the planet, nothing worked. When I went online to see if anyone else was having the same issue, I quickly discovered that many users were experiencing the same defect, it wasn't limited to just my unit. Nintendo's support was of no help, the only solution is to mail it back for repair. Seriously? I just spent about $500 on the console, games and accessories and now I have to pack it up in a box, bring it to a UPS store, ship it off and wait for 2 weeks and hope the repaired/replaced unit actually works? What kind of crap is that? Try explaining to your young kids that their prized new Christmas gift now needs to be mailed away for a few weeks and they can't play the new Skylanders Giants game they have been excitedly waiting months for. I have been burned as an early adopter before (it comes with the territory sometimes), but I hereby vow to NEVER be an early adopter again, this is the last launch console I am ever buying (regardless of brand). I will wait a few months until they get all the bugs worked out, let other people deal with the headaches. I recommend avoiding the Wii U for a couple of months until all the hardware/software bugs are worked out and all the defective launch stock is sold off the shelves. I realize that many launch units are working fine, but based on what I read from so many other people online having the same issues, such a significant failure rate is an absolutely unacceptable quality problem (even for my beloved Nintendo). Getting a new console is supposed to be a fun, exciting experience for the whole family, not a frustrating and sad disappointment.  Sorry Nintendo, you guys really dropped the ball on this one.
**UPDATE 12/31/2012: I convinced the retailer to exchange the defective unit for a replacement, the new unit works perfectly, kids are happy.  At this time, I would only recommend purchasing this item from a retail store that will give you a prompt, hassle-free exchange if you get a lemon.  When the console works, it is amazing, love it.

Bio2 is just more of the same, and while that's very good, it's something of a letdown. It feels like the designers are just milking this game without adding much imagination or, in fact, much value. While playing I kept waiting for something new and interesting, but all I got were mild tweaks of what made the original so good (and more fun to play, frankly).

The plasmids are no better if even as good, the action is very similar (the drill is hardly a fabulous new weapon!), being Big Daddy is no great innovation, likewise fighting Sofia Lamb, the new environments are few and mostly unthrilling, and all in all I'm not really blown away in any way, shape or form. Even the sounds and retro songs, which I loved in Bio1, seemed less compelling this time around.

Bioshock 1 is five stars all the way; it set new standards and raised the bar.
Bioshock 2 is three stars; it merely follows the old standards and barely (if at all) clears the bar set by its predecessor.

I'd say don't waste your money on this one unless you're a huge Bio1 fan and have exhausted it in every way. This one looks about the same, plays about the same, and in fact is basically just more of the same. And that's not really what gamers are looking for, is it? Compare this rehash to Uncharted 2, which is in almost every way superior to its predecessor: better graphics, new screens, new ideas. Bio2 offers almost none of the above. So what's the point?

It's rather ironic that this game is made by Take 2, as that's what this is: a second take that in no way improves on the first. If you're going to make a sequel to a classic game, it too should be classic, and not the same game and graphics with a few minor changes.

Bioshock 2 is, in a nutshell, a cash grab. Some might even call it a ripoff. For half a c-note you deserve a whole new ballgame, not just one more inning.

Ill start with the good before getting into the bad. So one of the strongest aspects of the game in my opinion was its character roster but not all of them. Specifically, its male character roster (Ill get to the female later). The male characters in this game are absolutely outstanding, Alto the young teen thrust into the heroes role to save his village and family, Klaus the calm and collected leader, Rusty the womanizing knife thrower with a short fuse, Archibald the chivalrous awkward noble, Dante loyal and unfaltering in dedication to Hilda, Hrodulf the deserting military betrayer and former superior to Rusty. The list of quality and likeable male characters goes on and on and I have to commend Atlus games for their creation of such great characters. Next would have to be the game mechanics. While frustrating at times and a bit clunky, it still works and it works well. The play style is well developed and thought through and I have to commend them on that.

Now on to some of the bad. Im only hitting on what stood out to me as the best and worst things in this review. So first since I spent so much time gushing on the male characters, now Ill take about the females. The female roster of characters in their design for the most part is awful. If the character isn't generic and boring, shes absurd and ridiculous to the point where its annoying. Popo, Nonoka, and Mordimort were all characters that had excellent potential but ended up suffering greatly and ruined for either comedic relief or to fill a trope role. Popo being the typical referring to herself in the 3rd person and yelling all the time, Nonoka being over the top shy to the point that she wears a box over her head (don't get me started on the ""Nin-nin"" catch phrase every second) and Mordimort being ruined to fill the sleepy dolt trope. The best female characters in the game aren't even the primary female witches. Hilda, Marie, and Queen Anastasia (Ana) take the cake for sure. The second big issue with this game is its horrible punishment for not developing and working with every member of your party. <<MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD>> Skip to the SPOILERS END to avoid this, its nothing big though. The game really bends you over and gives it to you if you don't work with every party member before some of the major events of the game. A few examples. Rusty vs Hrodulf 1v1. Rusty leaves the party to fight Hrodulf and confront him on his betrayal of their past unit. If you haven't worked with Rusty like many ive seen do unfortunately (since hes great) You will literally be unable to win this fight. and guess what? if you unfortunately saved just before the fight, you have to start the ENTIRE game over to properly level Rusty for this moment since Rusty HAS to beat him to progress. Instances like this happen a lot. Like when the Harbingers attack the capitol to prevent the Anthem and the party is split into 2 groups. Again, you may not be able to progress depending on who you leveled from these groups. Really a poor design choice doing this.

The game was good but suffered from some stuff that kept it from being better. I would honestly still recommend the game though.",Hope you like reading this novel of a review.,1499644800,2,,

I am a hobby pirate historian and own several other pirate games, computer and board. My only other MMO reference/experience is World of Warcraft; so, I'm using that as a point of comparison. The game offers a number of aspects of play, character based and ship based, as well as an economic facet; I will comment on each.

The character based aspects are limited to movement around ports, visiting shops and such, movement in missions and boarding actions. Do not expect WoW's ability to move around and over nearly everything, no swimming, no jumping over things. Missions tend to be instances, think Guild Wars rather than real MMO. The swashbuckling/sword fighting system borrows from other MMOs in the use of skills, and while in my opinion is a good feature, is still a little cumbersome in its management of readily available mix during actual combat.

Ship based activity borrows much from Sid Meier's Pirates! and adds another set of skills to be learned as you gain experience levels. Ship movement is intuitive and allows for grappling, repairing and changing ammunition. Ship to ship combat is still instance based rather than true MMO, which may be a reasonable compromise, but...

The economic aspects of the game offer the ability to build industry and produce goods, not really sure that this fits with being a pirate, but chalk it up to a concession for playability. The downside is that while you can produce items, demand seems to be limited in the extreme.

Bottom line time. There are aspects of the game that I found entertaining; however, the initial release is buggy and still needs refinement and a few more features to make it worthwhile. Others might say that every other MMO that has come out has faced the same challenges, and I would argue that I should not be expected to pay full price just to help out with the later stages of what amounts to a beta test. For myself, I cannot see myself paying a monthly subscription to play this game, and that makes me sad, because 'I really wanted to like this game.'

4.0,False,"11 12, 2012",A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B00005B8FZ,Mike London,"The Gameboy Advance is unique in the Nintendo catalogue as being a system without an original Mario title.  Barring the abysmal failure of the Virtual Boy, the lack of a Mario title has never occurred before or since.  Much like a person without a country, a Nintendo without a Mario just feels adrift and cut off from the rest of the gaming universe and real time gamer economy.

Of course, one could argue that Mario IS Nintendo.  To remedy the lack of Mario, instead of developing an original game, instead Nintendo elected to issue the ""Super  Mario Advance"" series, which are simply remakes of pre-existing Mario side scrollers.  There were four total.  Although disappointing that we never got a real Mario game for the Gameboy Advance, the Advance series holds its own as great portable Mario fun, although this strength is primaly found in the original games themselves.

Although probably not a concern now, years after the fact, if you have a Gameboy Advance and you are looking to purchase one of the Mario Advance titles, you may be better served with one of the other, longer games.  If you are not familiar with ""Super Mario Bros. 2"", the game is twenty levels long, and can easily be beaten within an hour if you are speed-running or even if you are taking your time.  If you want longer play time then I would probably go with ""Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World"".

However, for those who love the Mario series and ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" in particular, this is a fine remake, even with all the changes from the original game.  Given the age of this remake, unless you want to experiences the changes for yourself, you may be better served picking  ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" up in some other regard, such as a digital form or the 2010 ""Super Mario All-Stars"" remake for the Wii.

Beware of one change.  The voices.  Oh God, the voices.  They are horrendous.  All four have been given voice acting.  These sayings get grating, to say the least.  Almost to the point where you want to play the game without audio, it's that bad.

""Super Mario Bros. 2"", for those unfamiliar with the game, is the most drastically different of the four 8-bit Mario titles.  Mario defeats enemies by  picking either them or vegetables up and throwing said enemy/random vegetable at other enemies.  The story is that an big green final boss named Wart has taken over the World of Dreams (called Sub Con), kidnapped the citizens of Sub-con, and has taken over and styled himself as king.  It is up to Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool to overthrow Wart and restore order.  There are seven worlds total, with three levels per piece and the final world having two levels, for a total of twenty.

The enemy roster for ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" were almost exclusively limited to this game in the first few years after its release, with only Bob-Ombs appearing in the follow-up, ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", and Ninjis appearing in one level of the SNES ""Super Mario World"".  However, in subsequent years, enemies from ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" have become main-stays in the Mario universe and also appear in numerous spin-off titles.  Notably, however, the four bosses, Mouser, Tryclyde, Fryguy, Clawgrip, and the big baddie Wart have never been seen or heard from since.  Unlike Fawful from the RPG series, Wart is not very distinguishable from Bowser - they're both big, green reptiles.  Still, I would love to see a return of Wart and the other bosses!

Strangely enough to some (Gamespot in particular), Nintendo's ingaural release in the ""Advance"" series is a remake of ""Super Mario Bros 2"" from 1988.  Yes, pretty much everyone who is a fan of Mario and Nintendo know SMB2 was originally released in Japan as a Famicom Disk System title called ""Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic"" and originally featured non-Mario characters; it has since been revealed by Nintendo that ""Doki Doki Panic"" actually began development explicitly as a sequel to the original ""Super Mario Bros."", even before ""The Lost Levels"", but they were having issues with the prototype and ultimately released ""The Lost Levels"" as the followup.  However, Miyamoto and company always intended ""Doki Doki Panic"" as a Mario title.  Miyamoto has even stated in E3 2012 that, next to the original, ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" is his favorite Mario game.  High praise indeed.

That being said, how does ""Super Mario Advance"" stack up as a remake?  Well, those looking for a straight port will be disappointed - ""Super Mario Advance"" contains the most changes to the original game of all four ""Advance"" games.  We will get into the changes momentarily.

First off, you should know the game is based heavily off the version of ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" found on ""Super Mario All-Stars"".  Although gameplay was untouched in ""Super Mario All-stars"", all four games (""SMB"", ""Lost Levels"", ""SMB2"", and ""SMB3) were given extensive graphical and audio upgrades, with ""SMB2"" being the most drastic.  Nintendo has taken these upgrades several steps further, touching gameplay in addition to the cosmetics.

Like ""Super Mario All-Stars"", the original NES title is not included.  I wish they had included the original as an unlockable, like they did with ""Metroid - Zero Mission"" and the original ""Metroid"".  Although now available on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console, at the time of this game's release that was still several years away.  The only way to play the original NES title in 2001 was either an emulator or a working NES.

Here are the following changes:
-In a precursor to Comet and Star Coins found in all ""Super Mario"" titles between 2006-2012, there are five Ace Coins hidden throughout each level, which, when collected, put a star on the level map and yield a 1-up
-Player begins with only one heart, as opposed to the original two hearts.  An extra mushroom appears in every level, taking the total heart count from four to five.
-Hearts (which restore health) appear much more often than in the original.  Hearts can also be pulled up from the earth and are called Heart-Radishes.
-The intro to World 1-1 has been redesigned, including a giant Shyguy and a hill that bounces the player when stood upon
-The jar interiors feature new music tracks and have been completely redesigned, featuring Shyguys riding Ferris Wheels.
-Some 1-Ups have been moved from their original locations.  Others are encased in bubbles sitting on the ground, which the player must throw three items to break the bubble and obtain the 1-up.
-The game now strangely features points like the original ""Super Mario Bros."".  If you get enough points by hitting multiple enemies with a single vegetable you are awarded an additional 1-up.
-Giant vegetables, enemies, and POW blocks are now present.  Carrots have also been added as a new vegetable platform, but only appear in two levels, and the Red Shells are much larger.
-After defeating Wart, two Yoshi eggs appear in Sub-Con in all twenty levels.  Just like Pokemon, you gotta catch `em all!

There are also numerous aesthetic changes as well.

The biggest change of them all (at least in my estimation) is a brand new boss called ""Robobirdo"".  A robotic version of Birdo, this boss is a giant machine that now acts as the final guardian of World 3, replacing Mouser.  As of 2012, ""Super Mario Advance"" is the only appearance Robirdo has made in a Mario game.

This new boss is easily the best addition/deviation from the original game.  Notably, the original second Mouser Battle that originally ended World 3 has been shuffled to World Six, replacing Tryclyde.  As a result, Mouser still appears twice (just like the original NES ""Super Mario Bros 2"") and Tryclyde has been reduced to only one boss battle, which occurs in World 2.

In retrospect, ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" does feel as a somewhat strange choice as a launch Mario title for the Gameboy Advance in 2001; however, the game proved to be a best seller and a Player's Choice as well.  If you love Mario then I highly recommend you get this.  You will greatly enjoy yourself.  For those few gamers who are considering investing in the Advance series and HAVE NOT PLAYED ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" in any of its vast incarnations, most likely you will find the game entertaining as well, if a tad different from the ""traditional Mario formula"".","Perhaps a strange choice for a launch title, but fantastic nonetheless",1352678400,,,

What makes up for it is the very fun battle system, similar to grandia with a bar that tells you which character goes next, you can time your attacks to interrupt enemies and knock them back, if you do it well enough you can win a battle by just interrupting enemies and never get damage done. The game is not real deep, in that the many of the characters feel just like the others, except for Aurora the main character and Finn your mage they are pretty similar in abilities etc. Despite it's flaws I do like this game, and for $15 definitely worth it, and if they made a sequel (with a new writer) I'd buy it.

That's right, you get JUST CAUSE 2. But this is not a perfect world.

Step into the boots of Rico Rodriguez, the luckiest CIA agent ever on a mission to ...liquidate the ruthless dictator, Baby Panay. Said dictator is not the most loved ruler to begin with - hence the three existing (and bickering) factions that oppose him. As Rico you will undertake missions of destruction to help these factions. Completing these missions awards Chaos points that advances the story missions and unlocks better equipment.

The game is just gorgeous! Set in an endless archipelago world of Panau (actually about 1,000km2 or 400ml2) that spans from tropical jungles to snow-caped mountains and dusty badlands you can roam more or less freely. There are seamless day/night cycles but what are really impressive are the weather effects. Like a postal-office worker not rain or snow or sleet can stop Rico - and his clothes will get wet or dusty accordingly. And if you decide to drive keep in mind that cars will handle differently under different weather conditions.

The guns are quite satisfying but what steals the show is the grapple-gun. Grab from passing helicopters and hitch a ride or tie your enemies to exploding gas-canisters and watch them skyrocket to their exploding demise. There are a thousand uses for this weapon - and they are all fun.

There is also an endless supply of vehicles in this game. From rickshaws to super-cars and from jet-fighters to cigarette-boats, you shall not have to walk another mile in your life while in Panau. Crash them and see them accumulate very realistic damages. That's the good news. The bad news is that most of them handle like a semi-deflated boat.

Because not everything runs smoothly in the archipelago. After the fifteenth time you blow up the same tower and the twentieth time you plant explosives on a speeding car and escape with your trusted para-sail, you will start wondering if there is an actual point behind all this mayhem. Then again, is there really a need for a reason to keep blowing up stuff with great style?

To get on this ride you will need either WinVISTA or Win7. I did not notice this until I had already opened the box. I am still a loyal WinXP user at home but, luckily, about two months ago I bought a new laptop and, of course, it came with Win7. I never found gaming to be comfortable on laptops (the keys are closer together and laptop mouses not as ergonomic), but this is besides the point.
The point is that there was absolutely no reason for this game to exclude about 40% of gamers that still stick with their WinXP as they are compatible with all of our classic games.

Moreover, the game requires STEAM to run which means the copy you pay for will never actually become yours to keep. Whether you find this acceptable or not, you can now make an informed decision.

There are many things to like about Lost Odyssey. First the unique premise. A Immortal whose lived a thousand years, but wakes up with no memory, and as the journey continues you slowly remember. The second thing was the difficulty of the game. I haven't played a really hard RPG in years, I enjoyed it even when it frustrated me because I kept dying, it make you enjoy the game even more when you beat the game. Third the dream sequences were good also, and emotional. Finally the music was great, I really enjoyed it.

Now on to the reasons why I only gave it a 8. Some of the reasons are the same as why I liked the game. First the story was good, but takes way to long to get going. Second the dream seqences went on forever, and got tiring. Finally the load times in the game were to long and annoying. This is supposed to be a 360 game right.

I've had great luck with Pelican accessories, and these screen protectors are no exception.  There's one for each screen and with proper installation these will last you a long time.

For starters you must clean your screen with a lint-free cloth BEFORE you install these guys.  If not you'll get dirt trapped beneath the shields.  You also want to make sure your screens are dry if you had to clean them with a Windex or something similar.

The touch screen shield has more stickyness and is harder to install.  Just start at one corner and use a flat plastic to smooth out the bubbles.

The top screen is a little thicker with a border.  I've had that one move on me, but I stabalized it with some adhesive on the edges.

Avoid screen protectors made by Switch&Carry (BD&A) as those are problematic.  Overall, I can't say anything but positives about Pelican.  Just take your time to install these properly.

Good:
- A wide variety of events: track and field, shooting, archery, rowing, volleyball, cycling, diving, gymnastics
- Great difficulty scaling: You can dominate Easy right away, Medium takes practice, and Hard is, well, hard
- The button presses and stick movement seem to well timed.  I was worried about using the sticks in swimming to move each arm independently, but it's actually a great way to control the swimmer and is very gratifying when you get the timing right
- The graphics aren't groundbreaking, but they are good

Not so good:
- Because the same A button performs multiple actions, volleyball can be a bit frustrating.  Table tennis might suffer from a similar problem, but I haven't played enough of that event to be sure.
- The announcers very quickly get annoying.  Fortunately, you can mute them.
- Some events are just a bit too easy.  I shouldn't have been able to break a world record in javelin my second time playing it.  On the other hand, some events are quite hard and require a bit more practice to even be competitive

Bad:
The game did lock up once while loading an event in the middle of a 20-event Olymic games run.  When I reloaded the save, it marked me as not qualifying for that event.  It only happened once, but it was infuriating.  If it happens again I will update my score accordingly.

I would like to start by saying that besides the lack of courses and golfers, I don't see anything wrong with this game.

Gameplay: I will say that the game play is tough. It isn't like the previous installments for PGA where you could go out and shoot -40 in a 4 round tournament. I have played several tournaments with my created pro, and have actually missed the cut a few times. Putting seems to be the biggest struggle. I haven't tried an easier mode, but there isn't a put preview or caddie tip. You are on your own. It is still fun though.

This is the first addition I've owned since DW4, and I'm glad I made the purchase.

There have been a lot of things introduced since DW4: The addition of a lot of characters, new game modes, the ability to have 2 weapons, and a complete graphics overhaul (which, realizing that I had DW4 on PS2, isn't surprising).  The Ambition Mode was a lot like Xtreme Mode in DW4:XL, but with a little more RPG aspect (not much, but a little). The weapon customization leads a bit to be desired, as it requires a ton of grinding, but it's a really cool feature that can drastically change your play style depending on how you choose to change your weapon.  Another cool feature is the fact that any officer can use any character's weapon (though if they want to have their ""special move"" they need to have their own weapon in tow).  Speaking of the weapons, this has always been one of the coolest aspects of the game.  Watching your weapon grow from some old rusty sword or wooden spear your character picked out of the nearest dung-pile, to an extravagent, menacing-looking, steel beauty that will become the stuff of legends.

Gameplay itself is very similar to the other games (tons and tons of mindless enemies for you to mow down, with some officers that will give you a bit more of a challenge, and super charged officers than can absolutely ruin you in combat.  One issue I did have during gameplay was the lag.  It only occured when facing a massive horde of enemies, but this happens more often than you would think.  The load times for levels could be a bit lengthy, but nothing that made you pull your hair out (this really only got frustrating when trying to do the 100-level run on ambition mode).

Overall, it's a fun game, that won't make you think to hard.  It involves a lot of mindless slaying, though a good number of the levels have some cool stories and objectives.  A lot of new features are available to help you take out even more enemies, and the visual are striking in combat.",Good way to get back into the DW series,1416528000,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

So it's quite fitting that Nintendo would want to release a different kind of Metroid game:  pinball!  And unlike most other pinball series, THIS one is much more fun to play and fill your hours with.  There are 3 modes to start off with:  Multi-Mission, Single Mission, or Wireless Play.  Expert Mode is also available after beating Normal Mode.

You will begin on one of 2 pinball tables:  the Tallon Overworld or the Pirate Frigate.  Eventually you will unlock MORE tables ex:  Phazon Mines and the Impact Crater.  The pinball tables themselves deliciously represent what Metroid fans have seen in the Metroid Prime saga or other installments.  One important twist in Metroid Prime Pinball is that you need to collect 12 artifacts so that you can progress to the final levels of the game.  Yes, it does seem a bit confusing at first, but in order to get each artifact, you are required to complete a mini-game objective (ex:  Burrower Bash, Triclops Terror, etc.)  Lots of familiar enemies will get in your way as you try and get your very best high score!  And if THAT'S not enough, you will have to take on several bosses such as the Omega Pirate and Meta Ridley!

I am happy with this game. I'm not going to call it a 'great' or 'classic', but it will work - especially compared to last year's offering. It's not going to rock your socks off, and it's not EA quality, but it will get the job done for WWE fans.

PROS
- They fixed the clothes rendering issue that rendered oh-so-many complaints last year. Clothes actually move like clothing now and not like some wetsuit stuck to their bodies (except in the case of Goldust and Stardust because that's what they wear).
- Menus are much more streamlined. They made the Online feature totally separate, another issue that plagued last year's game.
- A wide variety of match types are offered once again, and now you not only have the arenas/venues from current WWE, but from WWE/F past and WCW as well.
- The superstar roster is super! Almost the entire main from current times, plus a ton of alumni and legends (dead and alive, WWE, WCW, and ECW). I should note Hulk Hogan is completely absent from this one though, since they weren't real fond of his latest blunder. You can always download him from the community, though!
- Career mode has been completely revamped. None of it made any sense last year, and you had little influence over whether your superstar was face or heel. Now it has this great interview process where it lets you determine that based on the answers you select. Also, you can CHOOSE which title you want to go after, and what rivalries/alliances you want to be in. You can also meet the goals to enter the Hall of Fame, or meet supplemental goals set forth by the Authority to align with them, should you so choose. This is the BEST feature of this game in my opinion, and my favorite part.
- Universe mode has been completely opened wide and lets you customize EVERYTHING. I mean everything. You can activate old titles, change whom has titles, make up your own titles, change superstar stats/characteristics/partnerships/rivals, attach/detach superstars from certain shows, activate retired alumni, completely re-arrange the show calendar, adjust every matchup/card, set where the shows can take place, and yes - even create your own arena.
- Showcase mode is awesome. It isn't as selective as it was last year and lets you re-live the entire career of Stone Cold, as well as his former personas, and sidelines involved in those stories. Even cooler, they have the actual audio with Jim Ross and King (among others) from the actual matches you are playing.
- Community feature I don't see much change, but it's still there for you to share creations which is a great feature shared from last year. It still has a 20-slot limit.
- Presentation overall is much more noteworthy coming from a next-gen game. Last year looked like a former-gen on a next-gen. I believe it was 2K's main goal in this offering, and it shows.
- They have limited the ridiculously overused reversals and grapples during play, which is very helpful and less annoying.

...and now, the bad stuff...

CONS
- Though the roster is a really great offering, it once again lacks current Superstar influence. Just like last year, it's like they took a snapshot of who was hot (and ignored who was not) around Wrestlemania time and rendered them characters, leaving up-and-comers left out in the cold. AND once again, they do not seem to be offering any roster updates to adjust. Hardly anyone from NXT is on this game (though I suspect they will release an NXT add-on like last year), and a lot of recent talent isn't either (current Divas champion Charlotte and partner Becky Lynch were among the highest exclusions I noted). There are also a few tag teams that have formed and/or reunited since this data was collected whom are also not shown as partners, or not in the game at all. This is why the community feature is so important. Take advantage of other people's work and share yours!
- The controls are mostly the same as last year save for a few changes (that I don't like and would rather have the old ones back). Submissions are no longer tapping a button as fast as you can, but moving a stick in a circle as fast as you can. Ugh!!!!! Even though they have limited reversal use, they are still VERY hard to execute because they've added a ""Good/Poor"" feature to them. It gets frustrating until you get the hang of it.
- Here it is, the BIGGEST complaint you will hear from everyone (which I agree with): 2K went the extra mile to make the presentation on this one worthy of next-gen systems. While that in itself is good intention, they overdid it. They have sacrificed some of the gameplay experience in-ring for presentation, for what I assume is to make it look more like what is seen on a TV broadcast of WWE. What that equates to is gameplay and player movement looks ""clunky"" at times, and characters seem more ""clumsy"", especially when they start to lose stamina. I've thrown a heck of a lot more missed punches in this one than I ever did in the last. You will also see a downed player ""slide"" to make a jump from the corner or ropes look more realistic when it really isn't. If he's closer to the left ringpost than the right, no superstar in real life would hit him from the furthest right ringpost. But in this game you can, because he will slide mid-move over to my player like magic. It's not incredibly obvious, but it is enough to annoy someone. Where this effect is at its worst: tag team or elimination matches. The more characters in the ring, the more confused the user's player becomes (targeting is terrible).

If you can get past some of the bad, it is mostly a good game worth playing. I like it, I enjoy it, I live in it. Some want gameplay back, some like the presentation angle better. It's all about what you like and will tolerate. That being said, I STILL think this series should be handed off to EA. I keep hoping, every year...","Better offering, but still needs work",1448841600,14,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The guitar does feel a lot better than the Rock Band guitar (at least to me and all my friends, who started playing Guitar Hero before Rock Band ever came out) and I find the body shape of the Les Paul to be superior to the X-plorer wired controller previously available for the 360.  As far as I can tell, the Rock band controllers are heavier and modeled more after actual guitars rather than controllers shaped like guitars, so the Les Paul doesn't provide the same realism that the RB controllers do...even so, the Les Paul is still a far superior guitar.

As others have said, there is one serious flaw with the guitar: the detachable neck can make the guitar stop registering notes.  I bought my first guitar in the Guitar Hero III bundle from a third party seller on a popular auction site, and noticed right away that the red and yellow buttons were having an issue.  I found several websites with potential solutions, and since I don't trust myself to unscrew the guitar parts and modify everything, I tried the simple ""clean off the contacts"" solution, which only made it slightly better.  I was lucky that the seller had a very reasonable return policy, and though I had to pay to ship it back, they sent me another guitar that has worked just fine for the last 3 or so months.  Though I am extremely happy with the guitar I have now, please consider yourself warned that buying the Les Paul is like playing Russian Roulette, and the odds aren't even that good.  Make sure you know the details of the return or refund policy before you buy.

After buying  the game though, the pro's really outweigh the cons. First off, Activision  decided that they would fraction the normal 'dot' system to extend overall  game play by slowing the rate at which a character can grow. (Through  truthfully, they could have applied the experience rules as is, but I see  the logic here.)  Veteran players will also notice a lack of Disciplines  and some addational costs to usually free ones (ie. Potence and Fortitude.)  in an effort to prevent abuse of them. (I won't bring up the lack of  Skills, Talents, and Knowledge...)
I've heard too many people whine about  the save feature, but I think that we, as a role-playing community, have  gotten too dependant on save features.  Save less, not more.
Hopefully,  the worst thing about the game will be fixed with some kind of patch, that  horrible Artifical Intelligence.  Your companions will constantly amaze you  with the way they 'burn blood' like it's going out of style.  The comp  plays NPCs equally bad to the point where sometimes they won't even defend  themselves.

4.0,True,"10 6, 2011",A2MCP2MTSKON9O,B000FQ2DTA,Subject7,"Synopsis - Final Fantasy 13 is the newest installment of a disconnected series of role playing games. It involves seven playable characters trying to cope with being branded as l'Cie (individuals cursed with an unclear task, gifted with magical powers and feared by the populace) by powerful entities called Fal'Cie. They inhabit an advanced, futuristic planet called Cocoon, which hovers over a larger, wilder planet called Pulse.

:)

- Despite initially being irritating, the main characters gradually develop into rather likable individuals.
- The game worlds are very beautiful, extremely colorful, and quite immaginative in design (to a fault).
- The music is great but not very memorable. You probably won't be humming any of it between play.
- The Combat system is new, fast paced, challenging and extremely fun. It requires memorization, predetermination and quick fingers. It does take a while to get used.
- Overall the story is good, but...

:(

- The game relies on narrative text (found in the menu) to tell most of the story. Without these texts, neither the cutscenes nor the in-game dialogue would be adequate in relaying what exactly is going on.
- The voice work of some of the characters leaves much to be desired. Often the character's body language suggests that their voices should be more emotional than they actually are (typical in Japanese to English translations). The inclusion of the original Japanese voice work would have been appreciated.
- The voice actors of two particular characters, Vanille and Hope, seem miscast. Hope is presented as a timid, pathetic young boy, yet his voice is anything but. Vanille is presented as a young, cute, bubbly young girl but unfortunately her voice sounds painfully forced. It would have been better if Hope was voiced by an actual young boy or a woman acting as a boy (as is typical for animated boys). It would also have been better if Vanille's voice actress was allowed to just be herself, instead of trying (too hard) to sound cute.
- Most of the game's npc's (none playable characters) are whiny, antagonizing irritants, making it difficult to care whether they live or die. Since much of the main character's emotional turmoil is based on this indecision, the drama tends to fall flat.

Conclusion - Final Fantasy XIII is a great game that tries out some new ideas and succeeds with most of them. Given it's high visual quality, fun gameplay and current price of around $20, it is well worth the purchase.

Therefore, I wanted to try the game just for kicks and giggles. Customization is fun, almost mind-boggling the different layers and colors you can lay on these cars. The cars look fantastic. The damage modeling superb (not as crazy as Burnout Paradise, but still fun to ""feel"" the effects and imperative nature of trying NOT to hit walls as it negatively effects your driving ablilities WHILE you race).

Career mode, even with the stupid menus, is amazingly dense and full of races. I played the game for a total of 2.5 hours maybe more, and I saw at the end of my session that I was only 3% through the career. AND that's AFTER I had beaten about three race days (roughly 15-20 individual races). Having to constantly upgrade your rides and tweak the effects of body parts to maximize your experience and performance is fun (especially the ""wind tunnel"" idea).

As a previous owner and fan of Carbon.. I really miss the Free-Roam ability to just drive for the fun of it around an expansive city. That I would say is my ONLY gripe with this game.

The Sounds are AMAZING. Especially if you have a decent speaker system setup to hear the roar of your NEW engine that you just modded into your ""piece-of-junk"" car. About 60 cars, numerous tracks, good soundtrack, and an ANNOYING announcer (seriously, its nice to make it sound ""live"" but please -- ""*cough cough* excuse me folks, hold on.... uh, oh ok.. nice well ladies and gentlemen sorry I just had to grab my phone from ringing.."" um, ok?

Kennedy, the rookie cop from the still-brilliant sequel Resident Evil 2, as he touches down in rural Spain, to rescue the President's daughter from an as-yet unknown group of kidnappers.

And really, since the game pitches you headlong into some of the best and most rewarding plot-driven action moments I've ever been lucky enough to experience in a video game, there's very little need for me to elaborate. That, and the fact that I hate spoilers! Trust a man who's been a confirmed games player for sixteen years: this is a great *expletive* game.

GRAPHICS: So what if the Cube original version of this game has better graphics? I challenge all but the most superficial kind of player (you know, the kind that's happy with endless driving and fighting game sequels) to be anything but delighted when they see what magical Capcom has managed to do with the six-year old techology behind the PS2. The overall visual theme (washed-out colours, smooth animations, excellent lighting) is very reminiscent of that king-of-atmospheric-games, Silent Hill 2, and the character and enemy animations are first-rate. Enemy design, from the lowliest (villagers, crows) to the more impressive boss battles (the first and second bosses are actually jaw-dropping) is worthy of awards, and the whole visual feel of Resi 4 is one of supreme mastery and undeniable creepiness.

SOUND: Voice acting's pretty damn great - in a nice change for a Resi game - and the music is excellent. Finally, here's a Capcom survival horror with real aural punch and muscle. The characters seem more real and their situation seem all the more immediate and tense because of the obvious lengths the sound designers have gone to to bring a deeper sense of the game's experience to us.

PLAYABILITY: Here's the real jewel in the crown: Resident Evil 4 is one of the most intuitive and playable games I've ever had. The controls are smooth and familiar to any fan of Survival Horror, and introduce some almost Metal Gear Solid-esque elements to the playing field. Dodging, shooting, and moving about are a joy to experience because of the lack of sluggishness that seems to plague even the most highly-regarded of the survival horror genre - remember how frustrating the speed of characters was in the Fatal Frame and earlier  Resi games was? All gone!

The learning curve is a little steeper than normal, perhaps, but in a game of this nature, where the storyline is all about being flung into unreasonable situations with a sense of no-way-out, this actually helps things along.

LASTIBILITY: This is, as with all survival horror games, not a terribly long trip. Don't misunderstand, it's 15+ hours on the first play through, but because it's such an amazing experience, you want more. Capcom (I love you!) has tried to alleviate this with some all-new PS2 extra bells and whistles, plus an all-new side-quest starring... ...someone :-), so it's not too disappointing when the credits roll for the first time.

But trust me, this is a game you'll come back to for both the storyline and the blissful playing experience again and again.

OVERALL: A mighty game; if this is where the Survival Horror genre is going then sign me up for life. That all Software Houses would put such a creative effort into their releases! Resident Evil 4 is deserving of all the praise it gets, and we should feel very thankful that Capcom is around to draw that praise out of us.
It's not so much scary as it is jumpy, like an action game with some beautifully-directed moments of tension and fear, and it is so, so much fun to play.

But this collection is lacking. The company ""Idol minds"" who put these 3 ratchet and clank games together did a poor job. There is frequent lag and some different, or completely missing details in the games. I will start off with ""Ratchet and Clank Going Commando"" since it is the game I am the most familiar with on the PS2.

Going Commando will occasionally lag especially when there are multiple explosions at once, the original PS2 version never lagged for me no matter how many explosions were going on at once. But the lag doesn't happen too often. The original version had very few glitches, this version will glitch occasionally. A few times the camera will get stuck under the floor or in front of the character making it impossible to see what you need to see, and then you will need to completely stop the game and go back to the PS3 home menu before going back to normal gameplay.  The trash cans in one level will often dissapear when you hit them instead of breaking and falling over. One time the mini gun menu dissapeared and didn't come back until I restarted the whole game. But enough about lags and glitches, lets move on to the parts of the game that they removed!! On one planet there is a missle yard and there are tourists. The leader robot takes them on a tour. In the original game the robot would actually talk about each missle, however, in this collection the robot says nothing!!!! he just keeps moving.

Now onto the other two games that I am less familiar with.

Ratchet and Clank lags very often from explosions... try to remember that the whole point of this game is to blow stuff up! Every single time you use the missle launcher it lags!! This is hard for me to comprehend since the PS3 can easily handle a PS2 game... Darn you Idol Minds!

RE4 was fantastic game that took the series somewhere it never thought it go, but it seems that Capcom played it safe and just took RE4 and repainted it, brought back fan favorite characters including a brand new character and added co-op and made a story which was suppose to be epic and detail the origins of the T-virus but falls flat with sub par dialogue in general the whole story feels rushed and a mess like it lost direction, the ending felt like a closure but at the same time unsatisfying. The controls surprisingly are unchanged from what you played in Re4 and it seems that Capcom can't grasp the idea that what worked in 4-5 years ago are old and dated and does nothing but hinder the player. Moving and shooting is the biggest gripe and although many re4 players will say it adds tension to the horror aspect, it doesn't work in this game where horror is obviously absent and Re5 in general is a  3rd action adventure and should be viewed as so. As it also has a cover system that unfortunately ""appears"" only where the developers placed it.

Re5 on its own is great game and adds features that make the game have more replay value.

While there have been some that have shown strong success recently, like Su Doku and classic crossword puzzles, video game puzzles have never seen to show within their age. That has also been the case with Nintendo DS as well. With the success of puzzle games like Tetris DS and the thrilling Meteos game, many seem to wonder if there is going to be a puzzle game that is different. Well, there actually is one out there right now that is kind of a twist, a loop puzzle that brings new gamers to the Nintendo DS and into full focus as well.

Magnetica for the Nintendo DS is a classic loop puzzle game. The game of course is a very simple game to play. Like games such as Bust A Move, and Meteos, the object of the game is for you to match three or more colored balls and knock them out of the game. However, you have to do it quickly, because if one ball falls into the black hole at the end of the line, the game is definitely over. There are several differnt modes of play, such as the challenge mode where you have to last through 99 levels of play, without failing into play, the driven quest mode, where there are 50 different puzzles to go through and defeat, and there is  puzzle mode, where you have to knock all the balls out of play within a limited amount of shots. The control is strictly from the stylus which is very easy to operate and control, as you shoot your balls and make it easier for you to win. The graphics are also bold and vivid, and they also are shown very well on the DS. The one disdadvantage is the music. Although you get a lot of good puzzles, there isn't as much variety from the music in the game.

Despite very few flaws, Magnetica is a great addition to the Nintendo DS lineup. I absolutely recommend this title a whole lot. If you are into puzzle games like Tetris, and Pokemon Trozei for thisn game system, you'll love this game a whole lot.

4.0,False,"01 10, 2014",A2HD6G443MGH2A,B0050SWYTC,dookerJ,"This game  is really amazing.  A stellar FPS game that controls extremely well and feels like you might as well be playing it on a next-gen console.  Gorgeous visuals, panoramic scenery, every little detail given tons of attention.  The campaign (single player) is VERY long; frankly longer than I remember any of the first three games being, and longer (at least for me) than Killzone: Shadow Fall.  I've been playing it on Normal mode for days upon days, and still haven't finished it.  They really give you your money's worth.  Then the stuff you earn in single player carries over to multiplayer, like a whole other game!  It's really a tremendous value; it was worth every dollar and then some.  I'm really surprised at how great this game is.

I only have a few complaints, and they were enough to take off a star.  In the campaign, the Intel Terminals are virtually impossible to unlock.  Sometimes you're lucky if you can get to the last piece on the last screen.  Hitting a wrong cipher symbol takes off 5-10 seconds from your already paltry amount of time left to complete the puzzle.  It's almost like they didn't play-test these portions of the game; overwhelmingly gamers on forums have said the Intel Terminals are way, way too difficult.  I'm usually a master hacker in games, do well in puzzle games, etc, and have NEVER seen anything this demanding.  It's a shame, because you usually aren't able to see what are really pretty well done pieces of intel; you can tell they really put some time and thought into them.

The other thing, is the lack of checkpoints.  While playing, the checkpoints are ""okay""; sometimes they have you repeating quite a lot of gameplay, and you die a lot, but it's fun, so it's not a huge deal.  On the other hand, when you need to leave the game, if you quit, you can only continue the campaign by restarting the latest mission unlocked, from the *beginning*.  So it's like, if you aren't willing to sit through an entire mission (which can take hours), you might as well put away the Vita and wait until you have time to commit to it.  Granted, you could play until the system goes into hibernate, and pick up from there, but it's less than ideal; you won't be able to play/load any other games in-between.  It makes you feel kind of locked-in.

The last thing I will say is, the Vita is kind of oriented towards younger people and kids  I happened to pick one up because it was bundled with my PS4.  I might not have gotten one otherwise (but the second screen capability should come in handy); anyway, just saying, if you're a parent, and considering this game for your kid, stop and watch some reviews and do a reality check.  This game is extremely violent.  The increased focus on melee combat means you see a lot of really gruesome, up-close, knife-in-skull, knife-in-groin, all kinds of deadly combat.  This is definitely a ""grownup"" game.  If you're a grownup, though, that makes it all the better, though, since it's good to have some ""adult games"" on the Vita, widening its base of games and making the platform better.",Almost perfect FPS,1389312000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I don't know how to classify this game.  It's kind of like a FPS except there is too much exploration and puzzle solving (which I think is a good thing.)
The controls were simple enough and the gameplay is awesome.  The different weapons, the upgrades that allow you to open new possibilities, I could go on forever.

4.0,False,"06 19, 2009",A2JRY1JJ7S5QX8,B0014UGK8G,Kyle D. Watson,"I played the first Red Faction back when it came out in the early 2000's and loved it.  I had never really liked first person shooters before, but this game, with it's storyline, atmosphere, and overall immersion, changed my mind.  When the sequel came out, I was very disappointed with it.  The multiplayer was good, but the experience of the single player campaign was gone.  When I heard that Volition was making a new Red Faction game, I was on the fence about it.
I initially purchased this game to get the bad taste left by Damnation out of my mouth.  It succeeded admirably in doing that, but it also did something that I haven't seen in a game since Uncharted: Drake's Fortune; I actually cared about what was going on in the game.  I played both Resistance titles so far, and while they were fun shooters, I didn't find myself caring about the people in the game.  Not so with Red Faction.  From the first beautifully rendered cut scene, you are immersed in the futuristic world of the colonization of Mars.
As for the game itself, I will start off with what I didn't like first.  The story seemed a little weak at points.  By the time you get to the end of the game, it really picks up, but for the previous 5 sectors, it is a bit shallow.  Yes, as has been mentioned before by other reviews, some of the mission types get a tad redundant after a while, and some of the Demolitions Master missions are incredibly complex.
However, all that aside, this game is still very fun if you make it so.  A lot in the game relies on the player to mix it up.  There are no rules as to how you can complete a specific mission, and since the game world is so open, you really have as many options as you can think of.  You can plant bombs on your car and drive it into a building, jumping out at the last second, watching as your car plows through the wall and then detonating it, reveling as the target is destroyed in a gigantic fireball.  Or, you can destroy it from a distance with rockets, or get up close and personal with your sledge hammer.
In my opinion, the best thing about this game is the destruction engine.  Literally, any building, bridge, car, or smokestack can be destroyed completely.  Even friendly structures, so be careful.  And since nearly all the missions revolve around destruction, you get to see the engine in action all the time.
The weapon upgrades also make it fun.  You start off with basic weapons, but, by destroying more stuff and completing missions, you gain more ""salvage"", which the Martians use for currency, with which you can upgrade your guns.

The weapons, for example, are exact to the real specs and number. You have to pay close attention to your speed and altitude when landing, especially if you're flying VTOL in a Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier. The vertical take-off and landing feature of the Rolls Royce Engine only engages at a specific airspeed. Going through the VTOL training really helps you learn the basic skills for flying the AV-8B Harrier. Unlike Ace Combat 4, you can pre-program your replay views before saving it and even choose a different background music. Not to mention, you get the whole replay for the entire length of the game! Ace Combat 4 only replays the last 4 minutes and you cannot save each individual replay movie.

The Good: This game is different.  It broaches a subject matter not common in games, the graphics are anime/cel-shaded. (Like Valkyria Chronicles or Borderlands, if you're not sure what that is.)  The story is interesting, and the main character is a pretty likable guy.  From what I understand, the choices you make in the game drive you towards one of the girls and several different endings, and it's actually similar to the paragon/renegade system used in Mass Effect 2, except there's only one meter for both girls.

The Bad: The puzzle gameplay is frustrating.  Honestly, I don't mind hard games, or complicated puzzles, but I'd like enough time to do them.  With Catherine, you often have a giant nightmare racing up to smash you, so you end up retrying a lot.  Also, you have a limited amount of continues. (but don't worry, you can get more)  Then again, when you finally do get it, there's a sense of accomplishment that you won't get from a lot of the way too easy games that are on the market today.  Honestly I don't think it's way too hard-just a little.  Another simple tip that helped me alot-talk to your fellow sheep.  You can move your meter and you learn new strategies for getting up the blocks.

EDIT: Now that I'm farther into the game, I'd like to add a little more detail.  There's more to the levels than the blocks slowly falling, or some giant horror chasing you, you'll also have to contend with enemies smacking you around, boss special attacks, (so far I've had getting knocked down, and getting my controls switched to backwards), and trap blocks.  Oh, and speaking of trap blocks, here's a tip that I found really useful: You can trigger the spike blocks by running over them quickly, and then you can treat them like normal blocks.

Oh, and I also should add more about the bar part of the gameplay.  Basically, you sit and talk to your friends and other bar patrons, and your responses move your karma meter (not really karma I guess, but I can't remember what the game calls it) over to blue or red.  I guess you could say hanging out with your friends is reminiscent of Persona 3 and 4, but you don't up your bond with them, but instead get a boost towards one of the girls (and take care because this affects your ending.)  Also, your responses to text messages you get from either girl will move your meter.  Oh, there's also a tower climbing minigame in the bar.

One thing I'd like to ask the Persona team though, what's up with all the games about climbing towers?  Not complaining, just seems a little strange.","A good game, but kind of a pain.",1311638400,40,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

Until then, we have Driver: Parallel Lines. The story is split up into two overall chapters, one in the 1970's, where you're a young getaway driver, ***SPOILER ALERT*** and the other in modern times after you, now a middle-aged man, get out of jail for being set up three decades ago by your crew. ***END SPOILER ALERT*** If you take your time to explore, collect all 50 hard to reach/hard to find gold stars (every ten you collect, you get a permanent effect, such as increased NOS tank size or increased armor), and complete the story this game will last you a decent length.

One of my criticisms of Driv3r on the original Xbox was that the cars were simply too loose, and slid all over the place, resulting in many annoying crashes and retries. In this game, the cars handle much better, and some of them are actually quite fun to drive. There are three race tracks (off-road-esque, traditional track, and demolition derby) and two Grand Prix races in the world, in addition to various other ""Hey pal, you think you can beat my record?"" checkpoint ones, and they're all fun and can be completed over and over, as many times as you like, with any car (and I mean ANY) you want to use. The selection of cars is pretty good (you can take race cars you win onto the street), most seem to handle uniquely, and nearly all can be customized and upgraded. One thing I definitely am glad was put in this game is the ability to ""save"" any car you have to your garage, so if it's your baby, you don't have to worry about it getting blown up and lost out in the world because it'll just get sent back to your garage where you can pay to repair it (the same is true if you simply leave it somewhere and drive back with another).

As far as I can tell, every single vehicle in the game is rear wheel drive, which makes them all fun to use on the off-road racers.

In the typical shooting game on the Wii, if you move your reticle all the way to, and beyond the side of, the screen, your character will turn the appropriate direction until you move it back in the center. This usually occurs in driver, but sometimes if you point too far off-screen, the character will stop turning, and you'll have to re-center the reticle to get it to respond. Another gripe is the function that the programmers gave to the Nunchuck's motion sensing capibility: a secondary steering wheel. This is a problem because you can't turn it off, so you'll find that you ALWAYS have to hold the Nunchuck in the proper straight-up position if you don't want your car to go veering off to the side. They thumbstick on the Nunchuck is already assigned to steering, so why couldn't they just have left it at that?

Lastly, the guns. You get your selection of a two handguns, two SMG's, one assault rifle, and one shotgun, ***SPOILER ALERT*** as well as a (entirely too fun to use) grenade launcher in the 1970's era, which is replaced with a (unguided) rocket launcher + minigun in the modern era. ***END SPOILER ALERT*** Oddly, no grenades or C4.

Overall, considering how the Wii doesn't have a GTA game, this is a decent alternative. It's also not as controversial, there being no prostitution, FAR less foul language, and no way to obtain/consume drugs. Aside from the annoying Nunchuck steering issue, my biggest complaint is that there simply isn't much depth to the game beyond driving, shooting, and racing. There are some ""side jobs"" you can take, but they add zero to the story and can be repeated as many times as you like.

My verdict: buy it if you want something for $15-$20 to keep you occupied for a while.",A decent GTA clone.,1257120000,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'}",

They really didn't change that much, they simply took good old Crypto and put him in some new locations, gave him some new fantastic weapons, and some new & creative missions.
First the weapons: In addition to the electricity and disintegration guns from the original game you have things like a shooting disk that drags enemies (or vehicles) around, and ""The Meteor Strike"" (IMHO the finest weapon ever). There do seem to be a few weapons that either because you get them late in the game or because they have limited ammo really serve no purpose.
The missions are a bit more varied than the first game. There are story missions, optional missions, and Arkvoodle cult missions. The game's story locations include SoCal's ""Bay city"", England's capital ""Albion"", The island nation off the coast of China ""Takoshima"", a Russian town ""Tungska"", and ""Solaris"", a moon base. The Arkvoodle missions have some of the funniest material in the game. Essentially you are trying to convince groups to join your cult with a number of funny possible responses to their specific needs.
They also added a multiplayer aspect to the game. It is good, but you are tethered to your 2nd player rather than just each freely roaming. I do love that all of the game can be 2-player, not just particular missions.
Finally there are some negatives. First, I can't be sure, but I think this is the same engine as the first game. Nothing inherently bad with that (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Theft-Auto-3/dp/B00005YTYJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Theft Auto 3</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GTA-Vice-City/dp/B0000696CZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GTA Vice City</a>), but with the same engine it is harder for this game to stand on its own.
Second: there are a lot of bugs in the game. Since it has an auto save, you can't really lose much of anything, but the game did freeze up on me during game play. Most of the bugs seem to be related to defeated enemies. For example someone dies on you and you are stuck in that place until the game works around that bug by launching you high into the air. That happened all the time. You will notice that most of these bugs do not stop game play or cause you to lose saved info the way other game's might.
Finally, and worst of all, the game is easy (also no difficulty settings). I may have failed a few missions due to getting shot to death or drowning (crypto can't swim), but you completely heal after 10-15 seconds of not getting shot. It is rather hard to die if you are even slightly careful. In a pinch you can use a mind control technique ""Free love"" where everyone will start to hippie dance and not notice you.
This game is quite literally the original game with new locations, weapons, & missions - not that there is anything wrong with that. DAH! was a great game.

4.0,False,"12 19, 2012",AZVCNOOQK36DH,B001C4C4KW,DryvBy,"Fans of the hybrid-genre strategy-RPG have probably already played through a Disgaea game before. It's a parody of the genre itself, making fun of every aspect the genre keeps sacred and exaggerates it. Disgaea's known for it's ridiculous stats, level caps, and gameplay length (try over 1,000 hours). And with each installment, everything becomes more and more ridiculous. For example in Disgaea 3, one of the trophies is to cause over ten billion damage to an enemy, while another trophy is rewarded for doing a 255 hit combo. If you're new to the series, that's a taste of what you're in for. A time-consuming game with incredible ""numbers"" and a story that is full of high-quality humor.

The game takes place in the pits of the underworld at a school for demons known as Evil Academy. At Evil Academy, being a delinquent means going to class and doing homework. So naturally, being an Honor Student means skipping class and forgetting to do homework. The protagonist, Mao, is the school's best Honor Student. His main goal is to defeat his dad, the Overlord and chairman of Evil Academy. Why would a son want to destroy his father? Power. And a small twist that hilariously ridiculous. Since Mao is obsessed with comic books and video games, he realizes that to defeat his father, he'll need to become a ""Hero"", since the hero always defeats the boss. From there, he's joined by a host of unlikely partners including the school's greatest delinquent, Raspberyl. During the adventure, Raspberyl's ""evil"" influence on Mao creates much more trouble than he can handle.

Revealing too much more would ruin several surprises scattered throughout the lengthy storyline. Did I mention length? The game's main story takes hours upon hours to complete. And the way it's presented may be a little off-putting to some. There's hardly any cutscene action. Most of the story is presented by showing a non-animated character avatar on the screen with spoken dialog between characters. It's presentation may be off-putting to newcomers, but if you can bare through it all, you'll end up with an excellent story that will have you laughing and thinking about death and get sad and stuff.

In-between the story, you'll prepare for battle using various shops and your Classroom Assembly. Classroom Assembly is where you rearrange characters to setup partner combos, pass bills that allow access to better gear and more, and create new characters. It's the same thing as the Dark Assembly in the previous games, just with more features. If you're not watching cutscenes or managing your characters, then welcome to battle. Battling on a grid map is the core of the game with only a warp portal to allow your characters onto the map. You'll set up your characters by moving them to locations according to how many move points you have and attacking if able. This is all turn-based, but it does manage to move quickly. Playing this game like a typical strategy-RPG will lead to a complete failure. Remember, this game is ridiculous and with that comes ridiculous strategies. One of the abilities you'll use is stacking all of your characters on top of each other and performing a massive combo attack. Or you may end up juggling a character in the air for a few minutes with attacks with another character until it's way past the time of extinction.

There's also Geo Blocks (colored blocks) which are randomly placed throughout the map, along with various associated colors that power up the space it's on depending on the color. By destroying a Geo Block on the same color space will result in damage to anything standing on it, as well as the removal or color change of said block. Confused? As an example, a Prinny standing on a red space may give the Prinny a power up of +100% health. Let's say you're on the other side of the map with a blue Geo Block in front of you that happens to be on a red space of it's own. You can attack it and change the red spaces on the map to blue, which also causes Prinny a little bit of damage due to the color change. This also causes the newly created blue space to use a different power up/down depending on what the Geo Block's specialty was. There's also a combo system with these too. In the same scenario, if another red space on the map holds a green Geo Block and you just changed everything to blue, then that red space will change to blue, damage the green Geo Block, then begin changing all blue spaces to green and so forth. This combo system may drain a character completely of it's health or close to it. It's a complicated system that requires you to check out your map before just randomly hacking away at enemies.

After you beat the game, the game then begins. You'll spend the rest of the time doing small side quests and grinding levels. There's a grinding that's going to take place. You'll not only be leveling up your characters, but you'll also jump through a series of grinding in a place called Item World. Let's say you have a wicked axe or armor piece but it's starting to lose it's edge. In Item World, you begin a series of fights inside the item you want to level. Depending on how well you did, you can improve your items value and stat points enough to keep it with you for several more levels. It's a cool idea, but it requires just more grinding. The maps are randomly generated so that will at least keep things interesting while you grind. On top of Item World, you'll fight pirates, aliens, and more weirdness throughout the underworld. The level cap is 9,999 and levels aren't handed to you like you'd think. Again, there's going to be some grinding to achieve that high of a level.

While the sounds are just fine with great battle music and outstanding voice acting, the games biggest weakness comes from it's graphics. The backgrounds are high-definition and the avatars are presented in high-definition, but the in-game sprites look like nothing more than a stretched out pixelated mess. The animations are smooth and the combo system is bright and colorful, just like you'd expect from Disgaea, but there's nothing special that stands out in the graphics. This game would have easily ran on the PlayStation 2.

Outside of the graphics and the grinding gameplay, the game is excellent and should be played if not for the incredible anime story it presents. If you're new to the series, this is a good place to start. It's addicting and fun, but you just have to bare with it. If you've tried Disgaea before and hated it, Disgaea 3 isn't going to change that. There's nothing that's drastically changed from the past.","Welcome to Evil Academy, honor students.",1355875200,,,

My mind has been changed. Monolith is really turning into a great house. All the praise that has been heaped on this game is due, so I'll harp on the weaknesses.
Too Damn Short! This is essentially a multiplayer game with three training missions. Highly entertaining missions, but very very very very short. Thought Max Payne was short? By the time you're breaking into the mansion in MP, you're done with AVP2.
No Risks. I think this game sticks too closely to what has been laid out in the movies. The plot, while entertaining, was just a re-hash of A4 with an added Predator hunt.  There's so much room for creativity in this universe I'm a little peeved that Monolith (who did an amazing job with NOLF) didn't take advantage of it (unless Fox kept a clamp on what was going on).
Balance. The predator is absolutely unstoppable. It's fun to play and there are certainly ways to get killed, but compared to the other 2 he's a juggernaut.

My favorite in the series is The Second Story. I think that Star Ocean: The Second Story will always be the best in my opinion. Nevertheless, when they first announced Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness I was excited. ""A new Star Ocean! Yes!"" was my first thought. Now that I have finished the game, I'll admit that it has a lot of flaws, but overall is very fun and enjoyable.

I was really disappointed to see such negative reviews for this game on IGN and GameSpot, but when I actually sat down and played the game I was very satisfied. It's not perfect, and it does have some noticeable flaws, but it's still an enjoyable game. I understand why a lot of people are disappointed in this installment of Star Ocean, but in my opinion it is still a good game. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect that. However, I had a blast playing Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness. Even with its flaws, it was decent enough to keep me entertained.

There are many positive aspects of Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness. There are also many negative aspects.

First of all, I'll talk about the combat. I have no complaints when it comes to the battles. Battles are fun and exciting while being easy to understand. Being able to have all seven characters in your party during every battle is a nice change from past Star Ocean games because it allows grinding and leveling up all the characters to be less tedious. Each character handles a little differently and fights in his or her own way. The amount of special attacks and spells learned to use in combat is large and diverse. Perhaps my favorite change to the battle system is the quick and convenient transitions from running around to encountering enemies. There's no longer a flash or wait before battles. This is a really nice change because it makes transitions from fields or dungeons to battles a lot quicker and less tedious.

When it comes to gameplay, it's mostly good. Aside from battling enemies, there's exploration, item synthesis, plenty of locations on the planet Faykreed, side quests, and a few challenging bonus dungeons. There's really a lot to do in the game. I like that a lot. There are some drawbacks to the gameplay, however. For example, there are long loading times In between different towns, fields, and dungeons. This is odd, considering that there is practically no tedious waiting time when battles occur. Also, compared to Star Ocean: The Last Hope and even Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, there's not as much content. While there is a lot to do in this game, it feels like a slight step back in regards to content.

The sounds and music are also rather good. The music playing throughout the game fits the battles and dungeons really well. I have no complaints regarding the sound or music.

When it comes to the graphics, I'd argue that this is the game's weakest point. The graphics really aren't impressive, which is surprising. Even Star Ocean: The Last Hope had better graphics, and that was last generation.

Now, the characters. While some may find the characters to be dull or annoying, I came to enjoy their personalities throughout the story. That being said, even after coming to enjoy their personalities, there were a few weak moments when it came to character development. Overall, character development is good, but could be better.

Finally, the story. This is a mix of good and bad. While the story was good, it was also weaker than past Star Ocean games. If you're a newcomer to the series you probably won't find the story to be too impressive. If you're a series veteran, it's a mix of hits and misses. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that the ending had me just a little disappointed. My biggest complaint about the game is the length of the story. Instead of being 60 hours long like most JRPGs, the story only lasts for about 20 to 25 hours. This was a big let down for me. That being said, the story was interesting enough to keep me going. By the end of the story, I felt satisfied with the overall plot, even if it had several flaws.

Overall, Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness is a mix of positives and negatives, but was still very fun and enjoyable. I really enjoyed the gameplay, and much of the story. However, I wouldn't recommend this as your first Star Ocean game if you're new to the series. There are better ones. Nevertheless, Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness is still very fun and enjoyable - even if it's not the best the series has seen.","This is Not the Best the Series Has Seen, But It Is Still Very Enjoyable",1467072000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The PS3 normally sells for $299 so if you can get it for $199-$249 or with a gift card then you will be getting a great deal. This bundle includes two games. The Last of Us is one of the greatest games of this entire generation- if not of all time. Batman: Arkham Origins is a step down from the two previous games but still a good title in my opinion. Just be aware that these games are not rated for kids so keep this in mind if you are shopping for a younger child.

The PS3 itself is a good system with a vast library of games to play. The only thing that bothers me is that this particular version has the lowest build quality of all the PS3 models. It feels cheaper, especially around the door which opens when you want to put a game disc in the system. This version of the PS3 is also a bit noisy. It is nothing too distracting but it is a little disappointing after the excellent build quality of the previous two versions. That said, this is the only model of the PS3 that is currently being produced so if you want a new PS3 then it is a moot point.

After seeing all the videos and all the hype surrounding this game, so far it's been a bit of a disappointment. The game needs major patches to fix issues.

For every pro, their is a con and usually the con is greater.

Pros:
- Paint booth: It's cool to fully paint and customize your car. It's almost identical to Forza's system.
- Attention to detail: The in-car camera is awesome. You actually see your drivers feet hit the clutch or put his foot on the brake. Also will move his hands to shift. If you drive as Dale Jr you can see his driving gloves are black Adidas.
- The pre race introduction is cool. Announcers talk about the track, fireworks go off, fly overs, etc..
- The menu: I find this to be really cool. People walking around outside, your crew working on the car, and it's easy to navigate. When selecting tracks it shows like a pit pass with stats which is cool.
- Gameplay: The cars are sensitive and don't require to much steering wheel input. Cars feel solid and drive like a 3,500lb+ car. Physics are pretty good.
- Drafting: Finally other cars will work with you and push you
- Pit stops: Animations are really cool. To see the lug nuts fall off and gas spill out is neat.
- Setups: You can tune your car as much or as little as you like. Perfect for the simulation or arcade driver.
- Pace car: Under caution its cool to see an actual pace car

Cons:
- Paint booth: Making your own decals and stuff is cool, but the controls can be clunky. NASCAR 09 did it right by having an online feature and then import it to you game. Would be much easier to make cool designs instead of something a 2nd grader did with crayons.
- Attention to detail: Things like the caution lights being on while the race is under green is silly. Also if you spin through the infield and end up on pit road you get black flagged for speeding.
- Damage: Even after flipping over and hitting cars head on, my car looks like I hit a deer instead of another car at 190mph
- Race modes: If you want to practice you have to go to a separate session from the main menu. No other cars are out there with you. If you choose to race, you get to qualify and then race. Can't even change your setup in between.
- Hitting the wall is a joke. Your car basically just comes to a stop. You don't smash into it and then your car spins out of control. If you drive through the grass your car doesnt spin out.
- Cautions: This is even more a joke. I spun out, 10 cars hit me, and no caution. I had to drive in reverse for about 10 seconds before it came out. If you spin by yourself it still won't come out even if you wreck hard.
- No DNF's: You can destroy your car as much as you want, drive with full tape on the grille, and nothing happens. Maybe you lose a little performance but that's it.
- Pit stops: It's great to have the animation but having to wait 10 seconds for it to load kinda kills it. Also if your under caution, the game should ask you what you want to adjust well before getting on pit road.
- Online: One word....horrible. If you try to bump draft you wreck basically. And if the caution flag actually does come out, the crashed car has to sorta drive back to start finish line from this over head blimp camera. One time I just stared at a stopped car on the back stretch for 5 minutes. Then when we were about to start the race, cars started flipping and spinning. Online is useless until they fix it.
- Career mode: It's basically just a season mode. Go to the race, race it, and move on. How come games like MLB 11 The Show can have ticket prices, free agents, stadium upgrades, trades, sponsors for the stadium, etc etc and we get a season mode? A real career mode would feature hiring a pit crew, buying a shop, building chassis for different tracks, hiring more drivers to make a full race car team (like Richard Childress Racing), engine shop and engine builders. When you race you should earn money and that money should be used to buy better crew chiefs, better products, larger shop building, bigger sponsors, higher expectations, etc etc. Have an off-season where you can test at tracks to improve your car and team or public events to gain fans and impress sponsors. A merchandise section where you can sell die-casts, memorabilia, shirts, etc etc to earn money and gain fame. Would be cool to start out as a rookie in a 1 car team and over a season or 2 be a major powerhouse and have a full 4 car team.
- Wrong paint schemes: I know a patch is scheduled to update the roster and paint schemes, but seriously, why make a game with last years schemes and cars? It would be like MLB 11 The Show releasing the game with players on last years teams. Every sport releases their game around the start of the season with current rosters, NASCAR should too. Over the course of the season, have patches and downloads for new car skins or if drivers get dropped or a new driver starts.
- Night races: Another head scratcher. I am racing at Charlotte and it's dusk the entire time. There are no day to night transitions. Either have the race in the day or at night, not in between.
- HUD: I don't want to see how many experience points I am getting for ""Dominating."" I also don't want car radar which is a small icon at the bottom of your screen showing where cars are around you. Actually, this might be a PRO since you have no rear view mirror and can't tell where anyone is unless you look behind you which usually isn't a good idea while doing 180mph around a turn.
- Spotter: It's great that he can inform me to drink tons of fluids cause its hot, but it sucks when he cant tell me there is a car low. As soon as a car comes low or high, spotter should tell you that. I don't care that I'm leading and can do this all day, I care if a car is coming up on me or I'm approaching lap traffic. Maybe he got himself a cold beverage and missed all the cars around me.
- Difficulty: Even on VERY HARD the game isn't very hard. Very hard would be riding in 20th position fighting for 19th. Very hard is being at Daytona or Talladega and being stuck in middle of the pack cause there is no where to go all by yourself. I raced at Charlotte and after 10 laps I had almost a 3 second lead. Then all of a sudden by lap 13 the field was right behind me. If my tires went away in 10 laps or the AI just got amazing, that's pretty stupid.

As you can see, a lot of issues. For their 1st time out the game is playable, but only to a certain degree. If you want online, skip this game until a patch is released. I am going to stick to single player until the new car paint schemes come out and the game is fixed. I hope this helped.",Good,1369612800,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},
4.0,True,"05 10, 2010",A24872ZOX2QFMM,B0013RATNM,kevin  k.,"pretty much what most of the others have said here is true-- the island is incredibly vast and gorgeous, the play mechanics are extremely fun, the controls are a mixed bag, and the save/checkpoint system sucks *ss.  all that being said, just cause 2 is SO much fun.

the grapple/parachute combo is genius, insuring that you can go anywhere... ANYWHERE... in this island nation.  there's a sense of wonder that comes over me every so often as i realize just how awesomely accessible everything is in this game.  like when i parachuted from a mountaintop stronghold and just floated for awhile and eventually came to the island's airport, all the while marveling at the lush and abundant scenery.  it's not at the drake's fortune 2/resident evil 5 level, but for a true open world this massive, it's close enough.

i haven't had quite the problem with the controls that others have had, but i can see what they're getting at.  the automobiles especially are a bit ""floaty"".  but flying is intuitive and a lot of fun.  and as i've said, the grapple/parachute combo is genius.  you can climb mountains, highjack cars and helicopters, travel from a to b, parasail (with both boats and cars), take down enemies, destroy landmarks, etc. etc., all with that seemingly simple mechanic.  it's the highlight of the game... well, after the island itself.

i don't really care for the drop/pick-up weapon system (like in halo).  i usually like the stick with one or two or three weapons, stick with those, and upgrade them.  to me, that's really fun, and you really get to know each weapon.  i was especially frustrated when i paid for a machine gun on the black market, then bought a sniper rifle, and when i went to pick up the rifle, the only option the game gave me to switch with was the machine gun i JUST PAID FOR.  very frustrating.  maybe that's how weapons systems work in open world games, but i don't like it.

the save system does suck.  when i first started playing, after the first couple of missions, i just wanted to wander around destroying stuff and enjoying the scenery.  i would just go off in a direction and get to know the island.  but, every time i died (which was often-- it's easy to get caught off guard by a huge number of re-spawning enemies when on foot with little to no ammo ), i would start again at this same mountaintop stronghold.  over.  and over.  and over again.  it got really, really annoying.  even when you save in the menu, it saves your progress, not your location.  did i mention that it sucks?

all in all, this is a great game.  sure, the story is minimal, and the voice acting is terrible-- but i found myself enjoying the cheese factor rather than resenting it.  but with such a huge world to explore, and seemingly endless ways to get around it, and seemingly endless stuff to blow up, i'm not complaining.

go ahead, jump into the world of just cause 2-- and grapple with it's awesomeness.",hella fun,1273449600,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Pros and Cons

(+) Pros:
- Excellent quality game, great graphics and sound effects.
- Solid storyline for the most part, despite some very cheesy moments and dialogue.
- Game runs well on almost any half decent machine.
- Smooth gameplay.
- Very addictive multiplayer.
- Game is more forgiving to newcomers when compared to Starcraft 1 or Warcraft 3. Different level leagues help players match up against people their skill level.

(-) Cons:
- Game is easier for newcomers, but it's still a highly competitive game. Don't expect to be in the master or diamond leagues if you're new to the game any time soon.
- Only Terran campaign available, obviously they want you to buy the next 2 games ($$$$).
- No LAN support.
- Bnet has its problems, interface is laggy at times and not always easy to use.
- Multiplayer games can get very repetitive because most people use cookie cutter strategies.
- Gameplay is VERY similar to Starcraft I, very few changes.

Summary: Don't believe the haters, Starcraft 2 is a fantastic game, BUT, it's not as groundbreaking as Starcraft 1. When Starcraft 1 was first released, a lot of its features were brand new and very appealing. Starcraft 2 is very well refined but little has changed fundamentally.

You don't have much freedom at higher levels of ladder/league play. You usually have to stick to the main 2-3 cookie cutter strategies or risk getting completely trampled because the game is very specifically balanced. This is great for E-sports, but bad for the general fanbase due to the lack of freedom. Expect multiplayer games to get very repetitive after some time. Playing with friends, custom games, and different leagues help make up for this to a certain extent.

The game will probably live on as an E-sport for quite some time (which is what blizzard wanted). The game should keep you hooked long enough until the expansions come out which should be good, knowing Blizzard's history.

I respect Blizzard for doing the game well, but they played it TOO SAFE. A few new features would've gone a long way.

Rating: 9/10. A must have if you're into RTS, but don't expect a game as earth shattering as the first, rather expect a very well refined and technically proficient game.","Starcraft 2, a diamond in the rough",1303171200,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This is not Diablo 3, it's not Diablo 2, or 2.5, or any other version....So why is the gameplay so similar? Diablo fans will notice a multitude of features and gameplay that scream ""Diablo"", but really, there aren't really any other ways of doing this kind of game right, you're bound to see the similarities.

Pros -

* Beautiful 3d engine _IF YOUR COMPUTER CAN HANDLE IT!_. Grass sways, immense amount of detail, but it looks fairly lackluster on slower machines, many non-gaming machines that are several years old won't really be able to handle it, take note of the min requirements.

* Long amount of gameplay, a friend and I have been at it quite a while and gotten through 1 chapter. (of I think a total of 3) Stack the upcoming expansion on, and you could have a game that takes you 50 hours just to get through on normal difficulty.

* Good enemies, solid gameplay. Overall it's just fun, if you like Diablo type games, and you're not expecting it to be exactly like Diablo, you'll enjoy this.

* Decent sound and music, not fantastic but I liked it enough to keep it on.

* Fun multiplayer, play with friends, it gets harder with more people, making things more challenging etc.

* It's cheap! Around $20 now, worth the investment if you like this type of game for sure.

* Different melee/caster trees allows excellent ""pure"" combinations i.e. caster/caster or melee/melee, but also makes for some interesting hybrid classes.

Cons-

* Lack of support/info. This game I think was fairly successful, but not like I'm used to, so there isn't an abundance of support or item databases etc.

* Fairly steep computer requirements.

* No character customization! You get to pick male or female, that's it. No features, sizes, nada.

* Quests are boring, not that I expected them to be otherwise.

* Odd graphical glitches if you turn the settings all the way down on certain video cards, honestly not too big of a deal.

* I haven't beaten the game yet, fairly low level (23) so I haven't seen all there is too offer, but the gameplay seems almost too simplistic. Bind a main attack spell/skill and use it forever... Cast support/heal spells occasionally.

Bottom line -

Titan Quest is a solid purchase for people who enjoy hack and slash rpgs, collecting cool gear, and learning a little mythology in the process ;). Worth the low price tag, and it will enjoy added content/replayability, not to mention a bigger online playerbase, when the expansion comes out first week of March, 2007.

I didn't play the original Shadow Warrior games, but the lack of knowledge of the original doesn't make the game less fun.  The game last about 20 hours and there are a variety of weapons to try and upgrade.  Each of the weapons seems to work better in different situations so they are all fun to try.  In most games, I find I stick with just one weapon, but in this one, each one had a use.

The sword is probably the most useful and fun-to-use weapon.  Using the touch pad, you can control a variety of special moves.  One part of the game I didn't like was that it was controlling the different special moves was difficult.  I had a difficult time remembering which swiping gesture corresponded to each special move and I also had difficulty quickly performing the gestures.  Also, sometimes I would enter one gesture, but the controller recognized it as a different gesture.  Hacking and slashing works well though too and I mostly found myself using the special moves when there was just one enemy around.

The game offers several different difficulty levels, so anyone can play.  I also liked that each weapon and special move can be upgraded as well as the character's health.

The voice acting in this game was amusing to me.  I would describe this game as silly fun.  There was a goofy story that was moderately enjoyable.

4.0,True,"11 9, 2009",A1BD5JY0P5E1P1,B000XJLQ24,wightlight,"Let me preface this review by saying that I am not a huge fan of metal music nor of Jack Black. I listened to some Ozzy when I was growing up, and I think Jack Black is OK, but those weren't the reasons I bought this game. In fact, the first time I heard about this game, I had zero interest in it. However, playing the demo, reading some interviews with Tim Schafer, and seeing some of the art behind this game completely changed my mind.

The Pros:

The art in this game is fantastic - the world, the character design, the ""legends"" you uncover, even the user interface - are all a joy to encounter. I never got tired of finding a new viewpoint and watching the camera pan across some fantastic heavy metal landmark. And the various heavy metal demons they've thought up are brilliant.

The story is top notch. The plot of the main quest, and especially the ""legend"" back story are really well done.

The voice work is truly excellent. It really brings the characters to life.

The humor - maybe I have the mind of a 13 year old, but the game made me laugh out loud several times and kept me with a constant mental grin.

The music - even though I'm not a huge fan of the genre, it really fits the game world.

The world continues - once you beat the game you can keep exploring or finish side missions you haven't yet completed. And there seems to be a bridge to nowhere - maybe a possible DLC single player continuation? I sure hope so.

The Cons:

The single player campaign is short. I don't think you are really enjoying it if you finish it in 6 hours like some are claiming, but I had about 3 really in-depth sittings before I finished it.

The time you spend on the ground with your axe is even shorter. I enjoyed the first couple missions the most, where the game had you dungeon crawling a bit and defeating a boss enemy at the end. Gameplay shifts quickly to the troop directed stage battle mechanic, which I wasn't really expecting.

The side missions are repetitive, and actually not all that numerous. I finished them all shortly after beating the game. Make sure you seek out the uniquely named side missions though - some of them are real gems.

Other Thoughts:

You will be doing a lot of driving around. Several of the missions involve racing your car or driving around and blasting things. I actually enjoyed this part of the game, but it does seem like you are constantly in the Deuce.

The world is kind of small - it's not as expansive as say Fallout 3 or Oblivion. But I think it suits the game pretty well.

You can shock just about any four legged creature and ride it - I don't think I really realized this until after I beat the game. I don't think it will particularly help you much during the game, but it's kinda fun =D

After completing the game and exploring what I thought was pretty thoroughly, I've only completed about 40% Of the game according to my trophy score. I only discovered a little more than half of the bound serpents, and I find myself lacking the motivation to ""complete"" the scavenger hunting and the rest of the single player trophies. (How in the world can there possibly be that many things still left to find??)

I'm not a huge fan of the RTS style stage battles (I know Tim Schafer claims it is NOT an RTS, but..) I haven't yet played a multiplayer stage battle and I'm not real enthusiastic about doing so, and that is a BIG part of the replay value. You'll probably enjoy the game a lot more if you like the stage battles, but I'm not sure what type of player they are aimed at. For hardcore RTS players I'm sure it's really simplistic, and for those of us who just prefer to hack and slash, it starts to become a chore. You may enjoy them, but it didn't float my boat.

For several years I have preferred Sanwa JLF + octo-gate/Seimitsu buttons for fighting games, and full Seimitsu (LS-32/PS-14-G) for shmups/other arcade games.  I prefer Seimitsu buttons not only because I love the feel, but because for me, Sanwa buttons can be too sensitive.  I regularly trigger inputs by mistake, and find simultaneous button presses more difficult with Sanwa buttons.  Seimitsus being slightly less sensitive helps me a lot.

I had never tried Hayabusa/Kuro before, and am pleasantly surprised with the feel and durability.  I admittedly did like the ""spongey"" feel of Hori's lower-grade buttons, previously found on the Fighting Stick line and HRAP3, but they're clearly not arcade-grade and don't last as long.  The Kuros feel a lot more durable, and they're just a tiny bit less sensitive than Sanwas, so I've been able to do quite well with them.  The Hayabusa feels kind of like a JLF, but seems just a bit tighter to me.  I enjoy using it.  So while I thought I would want to swap out the parts quickly, I now feel zero need to do so.

I don't like super-huge, super-heavy joysticks...I prefer something a bit more portable, like the previous MadCatz SE/BrawlStick line.  So while the size isn't my ideal size, it doesn't feel enormous either.  I appreciate that it's not heavier than it needs to be.

PS4 and PS3 modes both worked fine, and it works with DariusBurst on my PC with no issues.  It's very flexible in this regard.  Only thing it won't play nice with is Xbox, but I own several other sticks so I'll live with it.

The only thing I dislike about it is the slight input delay.  There seems to be about one frame of lag.  In many fighting game battles this won't make a difference--for example, when skill levels are very unequal--but I feel the slight disconnect between myself and the character, and I don't love it.

4.0,False,"04 3, 2013",A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,B009AOFNU4,Wilder K. Raven,"Well, this is the second mini-controller I've tried for Android and iOS. Without boring you with all the fine details and an attempt to sound like I'm auditioning for a position at some tech magazine, here's the story:

It's Okay.

The Good: It connects to Bluetooth easily enough, doesn't require any special software (though it is optional), and feels relatively solid and well-constructed. Buttons all feel good, and sticks/d-pad are responsive enough for most games.

The Bad: It's small. Too small, really. I get that this is for travel, but they really made it tiny and compact, and it's hard for an adult male with normal-sized hands to really get comfortable with it. The buttons are all too close together, and they're reversed from the normal Xbox/PS3 arrangement (the top and bottom button functions are swapped).

The Ugly: On iOS it's almost useless, as most iOS games simply don't support it. On Android the game selection is better, but the closeness of the buttons makes even the best gamer feel a bit clumsy.

Final verdict: Three stars for general build and quality. Plus one star for the versatility that allows it to work with just about any device that has Bluetooth, whether it be PC, Mac, iOS, or Android (I can't speak for Linux, unfortunately). That, and the fact that it doesn't require proprietary software to get any use out of it, makes it a notch better than the MOGA in regards to how useful and versatile it is. However, the MOGA has a nifty cradle that allows you to mount your device on it, and that balances things out a little. However, I'm docking a star for the outrageous price. It's simply not worth this much when there are other devices out there that can do this for a much lower price. Nothing about the SteelSeries Free makes me think it's worth eighty bucks (or even sixty-five bucks) at the time of this writing.

If you're just using Android, you could go with this or the MOGA. If you're on anything outside of Android, you really should avoid the MOGA because it won't work and the SteelSeries Free will.

So the final grade: Three stars. It could be higher if they'd be sane and drop the manufacturer's suggested retail price to under fifty bucks.

UPDATE 2016:  Okay, so I dug the SteelSeries Free out and decided to give it a go on my current Android phone (Sony Xperia C5 Ultra) and I have to say the experience is MUCH better now that more games support Bluetooth controllers. Emulators are where this controller shines. It has 8 buttons, two analog sticks, and a d-pad, which is enough for most emulators. The d-pad is decent-feeling. Sadly, the sticks don't have press-to-click buttons in them.

As a result of this controller holding up for years, and being much more useful with the new crop of Android phones and games, I have to bump up the review rating to four stars. It also helps that the price is more reasonable now (thirtyish bucks).

If you're looking for a game controller to stick in your pocket, this is a good choice. I think it would benefit by having a little plastic case with a keychain connector, but it fits in a back pocket well enough, as long as you don't sit on it. Those sticks might not feel too good if you do.","UPDATED review-- A much better experience in 2016, years later.",1364947200,,,

4.0,False,"10 12, 2010",A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00386PJRM,Tim Janson,"The developers of Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf have the best of both worlds.  On one hand, for a series that has been going strong as long as this one, they need only to make some improvements and work out the kinks of the previous year's edition.  On the other hand, fans of the series aren't just looking for improvements over the last game but new features which continue to keep the game fresh.  That's exactly what you get out of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11...some improvements, some new features, and a largely enjoyable new game.  With the tumultuous past year for Woods, you had to wonder if EA Sports was going to release a new game, given how many other sponsors dropped Tiger in light of his personal issues.  Perhaps as a way of addressing this issue, EA did not put Tiger all alone on the cover, but rather co-features him with Ireland's Rory McIlroy.

This edition is without a doubt the most authentic golf game ever developed by the EA Tiburon team with the addition of the new Shot Focus.  This allows you to add extra power, spin, and accuracy on your shots.  One might find that decidedly UNREALISTIC but think of it as bearing down and concentrating on those important shots during a round.  Shot Focus is not unlimited so you have to pick and choose just the right situations to use it.  This does in many ways make it more authentic as is simulates that extra shot of adrenalin a golfer can get.

You can choose to play as any of over 25 professional golfers as well as a handful of rather silly novelty characters.  Not sure if people actually use these but I think the game would benefit by including more actual golfers rather than these cartoonish characters.  What you really want to do is go for the career mode by creating your own golfer with more attributes than any game in history.  If detailing a character is your thing you can literally spend a couple of hours creating your golfer.  You can also upload your own picture to attach to your created golfer and literally play as yourself.

The reward of previous editions has been replaced by an experience point system.  The XP is gained through playing the game both ""in-game"" and online and allows you to increase your golfer's attributes.  Strangely though, whether you are creating a golfer from scratch or playing as Tiger Woods, you get the same amount of focus which doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  XP can also be used for outfitting your golfer, just as you could with cash rewards in the previous games.

Once your golfer is created you will go through a multi-step tutorial mode, which will teach you all about the Shot Focus and using it for a variety of shots such as drives, roughs, sand traps, putting, and more.  XP is gained during the tutorial so make sure you hit all the goals so you can start your career with a max amount of XP to increase your attributes.  Thankfully you can repeat the tutorial shots over and over until you master them.

Now you're ready for the PGA Tour...or maybe not.  Even with the XP you've gained you're still going to be woefully weak in terms of all your skill attribute ratings.  Shot Focus can help a bit but don't expect to go out and score a win in your first tournament.  You'll have to grind it out and earn your stripes along the way as you improve your game.  Unlike Tiger, you probably won't take the tour by storm.

The other major addition to Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 is the inclusion of a Ryder Cup mode.  In this mode, teams of American golfers compete against a European team.  You decide the pairs of golfers you want to team-up, going for balance as best you can.  Let them play on their own or swap yourself in if you see that they are under performing.  You can also play Ryder Cup mode online with up to 24 players total.  In all there are ten online modes of play including daily, weekly, and play-the-pros tournaments that let you play alone and then upload your scores to the leader boards. You will see other players' names and scores on the leader boards next to every hole, along with an ESPN-style ticker that announce other player's achievements which is really cool.

Graphically the game is as strong as ever with incredible textures and even more weather and time of day effects than ever.  It's just cool to view a fly over of each hole to take in the landscape.  The player models are beautifully designed and any gold fan will easily recognize most of the pros included.  There are glitches in camera viewpoints here and there that keep the graphics from the highest grade, however.  The game commentary isn't the most colorful but it is an improvement over last year's drab announcers.

In all, the game includes 17 courses including classics like St. Andrews, TPC Sawgrass, and Pebble Beach along with five new courses: Celtic Manor Resort, The Greenbrier, Liberty National, TPC Scottsdale, and Whistling Straits and more courses will be available for download.

While not perfect, EA has succeeded in adding several key new elements to the long-running series that will make golf fans stand up and cheer.",SOME NICE IMPROVMENTS BUT NOT PERFECT,1286841600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4.0,False,"10 16, 2008",A278KWZ6FSE0S7,B000VJRU44,Annie,"Wii Fit is a fun activity for the Wii. I specify ""activity"" because it's not really much of a game. It's enjoyable, there are challenges, and occasionally you will rack up some points, but it's not really a game. It's marketed as a game that happens to be exercise, but in reality it's just exercise that feels like a game. The difference is important because if you decide to create a Wii Fit regimen in the hopes that you can play an hour of games a day and exercise at the same time, you'll probably be disappointed. If you hate exercising already, the Wii Fit won't make it enjoyable, it will make it bearable.

The reason Wii Fit makes exercising bearable is because it sets small goals (you might exercise for an hour a day, but it's broken up into a series of three or five minute segments), it gives you rewards (in the form of unlocking new activities or other game features), and it's even fun sometimes (particularly the balance games portion). Essentially, it takes your mind off of the fact that you're sweating and possibly miserable.

In short, I love Wii Fit. I like the ability to tailor a workout to your strengths (or, conversely, work on your weaknesses) by being able to mix up a variety of activities from yoga, strength training, and aerobics. Despite my love of it, however, it has a one major flaw: it is extremely judgmental for being a friendly-looking video game. If I wanted someone to make me feel bad about myself, I could call my mother up, thanks.

First of all, it relies heavily on BMI, which is not an accurate standard. It's a good starting point for judging health, but it is by no means comprehensive. People with high muscle mass (myself included) can seem overweight. Also, BMI is a horrible indicator for children, who tend to plump out before a growth spurt or become slightly underweight immediately after one.

Secondly, this game will judge every ounce you gain. It doesn't give a crap if you're putting on muscle mass, are wearing a heavy sweatshirt, have indigestion, or just ate. Normal bodies will fluctuate in weight -- up to one or two percent -- for almost no reason at all. This is normal. Wii Fit, however, will ask you WHY you gained that quarter of a pound and ask you to choose from a list of reasons. Even if you non-committally answer with, ""I don't know."" The game will tell you to watch what you eat. If you dare to answer ""Indigestion"" twice in a row, it says something along the lines of ""Indigestion AGAIN, eh?"" And then implies that you're probably fibbing. All of the game's ribbing is relatively good natured, but the fact remains that any weight gain is looked down on. Conversely, even though it shames you for gaining half a pound, it doesn't congratulate you for losing half a pound. So until you reach a pre-set goal, you usually hear mostly chiding comments.

Being shamed by a video game isn't really one of my life's concerns, however, so I don't let that deter me from enjoying Wii Fit. However, if you are sensitive about your weight and/or are recovering from an eating disorder, it might be best to skip this one.

I finally gave in and upgraded my multiplayer capability by getting an extra controller, and adding bought a PDP charging station for my controllers.  It arrived today, and so far I'm pretty happy with it ... I've been able to get rid of the rat's nest of charging cords cluttering my entertainment center, and now I'm also forward compatible if I eventually get a bluetooth voice unit.

LIKES:

* Appearance:  The unit has a sleek and elegant design.  The bi-color clear charger guides are attractive, and informative (they glow red when actively charging, and switch to green when they detect a full charge.  I haven't checked their draw yet, but given that they use tiny LEDs, their standby draw is bound to be quite low.

* Stability:  The stand clips very securely into it's wide base, so it's completely free from wobbles, and the low-profile rubber feet on the bottom prevent scratching of furniture.

* Space saving design:  The ability to stack the controllers, and condolidate 2-3 charging cords into just one is a welcome upgrade to my former setup.

DISLIKES:

* My only complaint is that in their efforts to make this unit as visually appealing as possible, they also made it slightly awkward to insert the controllers into the charging slots ... you have lean fairly close in order to properly align the connection, and you have to use 2 hands (1 for the controller, and one for the top of the charging unit's arm) to successfully seat a controller diagonally upwards into its charging connector.  They could have made the connection process a bit more ergonomic than it is.  Still, it's a minor nit.

* My other minor nit is that if a controller is connected to the charger, the LED light never turns itself off, which adding night time light pollution to the bevvy of other electronic devices cluttering my living room.

The Good:

- The song selection is pretty strong. I don't really know why someone would say there are only ""3 or 4 good songs."" I'll admit that my tastes aren't always geared to the actual songs on the game, but it's fun to play nonetheless. My only gripe is that the selection of songs from Guitar Hero 3 is way too large. GH:3 was a PS3 game, not a PS2 game. Using up five tracks for this seems like overkill and filler - I hate doubling my library of songs.

- I like the new note charts. ""TTFAF"" expert becomes infinitely more playable on the GH:WT guitars due to the tap/slider feature in the intro (it was pretty tough to hit that first note with your elbow in GH:3). Some songs feel awkward, though; is there really any reason that ""Take It Off"" by The Donnas should rate so highly? The difficulty is incredibly artificial.

- The trophies are fun, but really, really difficult (100% the mosh on ""Raining Blood""? Come on now).

The Bad

- Aesthetically, this game is really, really tired. Little effort was put into sprucing up the graphics, and the characters are the same stock losers as always (OK - Lars Umlaut is pretty cool). There are no guests.

- The online play is an utter joke. I guess this is what happens when an idiot company runs their franchise (and, probably, the entire genre) into the ground by releasing 100 games in a year. It's not like sales for this one have been off the charts, but again, that's no surprise (even Activision sees the writing on the wall - why else would they give away their next sales nightmare, ""GH:VH""?). You'll be lucky if you find anyone online. Heck, even when I bought the game, there was no one online.

The game is dependant on your ability to craft darts or find bullets to kill the enemys of the game. You will never have enough ammo to march through the compound and kill every enemy. You will need to run, close doors, operate lazer gates, and ect to get through this game.

The enemys are so well used in the game that they are completely plausable. They take a great deal of damage and are fast and strong enough to rip you apart.

They all require a very particular way of racing, so each time you switch from one group to another you'll need to readjust the way you play and the A.I seems to do the same. The AI seems very good and exhibits different racing personalities and the game features a wide range of tracks, boasting of around 100. The game demands that you level up in all disciplines if you wish to take part in the special GRID Masters/Legends events that take place at every so many levels. Career progress is measured in seasons. Each season, you pick a discipline and sign up with a sponsored team and that team gives you specific objectives to fulfill, like no collision damage and so on.

The cockpit view has returned as well as car tuning, something that GRID 2 was sadly lacking. Each option is accompanied by a helpful summary of what each tweak will do, so there is no need to have a in-depth technical car knowledge in order to understand the tuning. GRID Autosport or simply the GRID series in general is not a simulation or arcade, it is both, it  mixes simulation and the arcade experience both in one. At times it can seem really hard because an induced over-steer is easy to achieve, but practice makes perfect and that's what true racing is about. The game also has an online mode but I'm not much of an online player so I can't comment about those features, but I do know someone who is playing it and they say it does have lots to do in it.

In all it is a really fun game, even if some of the major gaming sites are giving it some borderline low scores. GRID Autosport is a quality product, as one would expect from Codemasters when developing a racing game. It's just difficult these days for many people to pick up and play when there are next gen racing games on the way. Many of the problems I hear people saying about this game is that it suffers with an extremely linear career mode by having limited progression choices.

Ultimately the objective is to play in each of the five racing categories to reach a certain level to unlock the GRID event and repeat, and this tells the player that it is progression for the sake of progression. GRID Autosport does have a lack of choices, and simply asks the player if they want to choose whether they play a Street event or an Endurance one. The cars are picked for you, their upgrades are limited and even your ability to tweak or alter a vehicle's setup is decided by the event you participate in.

You can still customize the difficulty of the game, tailoring every aspect of the underlying systems, such as realistic damage to assisted braking and you earn cumulative extra XP based on your settings. However, even with the said, GRID Autosport is much more of a racer than GRID 2 and racing is what this game is really about. As it stands, there are plenty of RPG games available for players that are looking to make choices, so the true essence of GRID Autosport is held within the walls of racing, so it is racing you will be doing. The graphics seem well done as well as the frame rates, menus, AI, handling, sound, collisions and many other things. It is a game about quality over quantity, and in the end, that is what truly matters.","Not Bad, Not Great, But Definitely Better Than Average",1403654400,19,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4.0,True,"02 20, 2016",A3A26E8WKXIOM3,B0041RR0TW,S. W. Strickland,"I have been using a controller from my PS4, which has mostly worked fine. Two major problems I had was that it seems a lot of game designers for PC, use the Xbox button layout and color, so I would have to keep looking to see what I should be pushing. Second, being there is no wireless receiver, I have to keep the joystick plugged in, which limits your distance from the computer and since the connection is loose can come unplugged from the joystick.
So I looked for a comparable game pad that wasn't too expensive. There are quite a few and you can go cheaper but I have used many Logitech products in my life and enjoy their quality and the reviews were mostly positive.

The gamepad has a good weight to it and certain aspects have a good feel. The grip coating underneath feels smooth yet gripping. The thumbsticks look very similar to a PS4 thumbstick though the movement seems a little more loose that a PS4 controller.
The buttons on the right are modeled after an Xbox controller scheme so button mappings shown in games match up exactly in those games.
The gamepad looks like you took prominent features from both PS4 and Xbox controllers and put them together.
The gamepad also has a rumble feature you can turn off or on, this is nice if you want it and that you can turn it off to save on battery usage is also nice.
The gamepad uses 2 AA batteries, which is nice in some ways. Easily replaceable but a continuing cost, at least you do not have to remember to put it on a charger or cord. Logitech also was generous enough to include Duracell batteries instead of a cheaper generic brand.
For connectivity, the gamepad comes with a standard small Logitech usb transponder just like their mice and keyboards do. I did wind up going to their page and downloading drivers to get the gamepad working on all games, some just didn't want to recognize it.

The negatives I would say about the stick are few but may be big depending on how you feel about them. First, the handles seem a little on the short side. To me its like a lot of compact pistols where your pinky hangs off the end, same here. It just does not feel like you have a good firm grip, you don't feel like you are going to drop it, you just don't quite feel comfortable. Maybe it's just me. If you are close to a computer store that has products on display and this one is, I would suggest picking it up and holding it to see what you think.
Second, The thumbsticks have a thinner clackety kind of sound too them, which I don't notice as much with the PS4 controllers. Upon hearing me use the F710 for the first time, my wife asked if something was wrong with it. Though a little noisy and a little on the looser side, it doesnt seem to affect any game play. I notice the noise more since she pointed it out.

Overall I like the F710, I think for the most part you will be happy with it. There are many many products out there, especially in a cheaper bracket but you will get what you pay for. I highly suggest reading reviews on them and if you can put your hands on them, do so before buying.",A very capable rumble and wireless gamepad,1455926400,,,

4.0,False,"03 31, 2006",A1NDYL6D6QNVCI,B000CSKOUQ,Valnastar,"This package contains both the ""Game of the Year"" edition of Dawn of War plus the Winter Assault expansion pack.

This ""Game of the Year"" edition of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War (DoW) contains new battle maps, online features and an observer mode to enhance what was already a terrific RTS computer game. Each of the four races in the game look and behave as one would expect from Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 (aka 40K) universe. The Eldar are graceful and cultured in their speech and appearance (think High Elves in space), performing marvelous acrobatic moves in combat. Orks are brutal, awkward and ramshackle in their appearance and gait, Chaos Marines and their demonic minions are dark, cruel and monstrous while regular Space Marines (enhanced humans) are very industrial and all business. The animations in combat are so good you'll want to play some skirmishes on easy difficulty so that you can take your time looking close up at the individual fighting using the fully moveable 3D camera. There are even special ""sync-kill"" animations when certain creatures destroy each other. For example, when the Space Marine Commander kills a gigantic Bloodthirster (huge winged demon), the animation sequence is one of the most spectacular in the game!

The skirmish option offers both single and multiplayer modes with many different battle maps from which to choose. This offers near limitless permutations, providing tons of replayability. The campaign is a wee bit linear and not overly challenging, but is loads of fun, has an entertaining story and can be completed by all players regardless of skill level. Difficulty level settings can be used in both campaign and skirmish play to make the game more or less challenging as desired.

The voice acting and music are quite good in DoW and enhance play enormously. The game is highly evocative of the dark, gothic feel of the 40K miniatures game produced by Games Workshop (GW).

Resource gathering is used as is expected in an RTS game, but it is very simple and does not occupy an enormous amount of game time. The emphasis of DoW is all on the action and combat! Resources are gathered by capturing strategic points and critical locations on the battle map. Capture more territory and more resources will be available to you to complete your research and build your army.

Note that the expansion pack for this game, Winter Assault, provides players with even more maps and options, as well as a new fully playable army, The Imperial Guard. The Winter Assault campaign can be played from either of two points of view, ""order"" or ""chaos,"" and involves a war against CPU controlled Necrons! Skirmish mode, as in the original Dawn of War, adds a lot of replayability value to the game, with many different battle maps and play combinations. Play any of five armies, play with allies or play free-for-all, and that's not counting multiplayer mode!

I don't have need for the USB ports other than charging the controllers, but someone else might. I don't really know how fast it charges it, because I just switch controllers when one goes low. However, it's convenient that its all in one place and I don't have to mess with any wires or plugs.

Cons: Fans don't blow to the hot part of the PS4. I bought it mostly to charge my controllers and some place to hold it. However, it came with a cooling feature. The fan is blowing on the side of the PS4. The hot part of the PS4 is somewhere on the middle and the upper or right part of the PS4 since the exhaust grills and the PS4 internal fans are there. So the fans of the bottom of the PS4 are useless since its not really cooling it down. Also the fans are kind of noisy when you turn it on. You can hear it when the volume of the games or movies are low.

Conclusion: I bought it for less than $20 which makes it a reasonable price for what I use it for. Any higher than that is kind of too much in my book. I assume a bulk of the price goes to the cooling feature (fans) of the unit. As I stated in the cons, it doesn't really cool anything and the fans themselves are kind of noisy.","Good for holding the PS4 and Controllers in one place.

I can see myself replaying the campaign again for a while to hit all the achievements and the couple that were so impossible with my current skill that I had to turn down the difficulty to hard to be able to beat it.

I also tried the multiplayer and it seems ok. But where is the lobby?

As for LAN play, I was able to reproduce it with a beefy broadband so that was not too probematic. I can see it been a problem for very large LAN party. So it was really a bonehead decision by Blizzard to ban it.

LAN is where i had the most fun with the original SC and the reason why i played it for years with friends and beers.

Most importantly, though, this game (plus a dance pad) can really work up a sweat and it's a lot of fun too.

1) You're stuck with a certain character you may or may not like depending on which selection of songs you choose.
2) While some may appreciate the increased difficulty, I don't like the fact the hardest workout mode is (still) too easy, yet the easiest game mode is still very hard.  For workout purposes, something in between would've been nice.

1.) Even though Saboteur is marketed as an open-world game in the vein of Grand Theft Auto, there's not much for you to do if you wander off set missions. Luckily, the missions are fun, (who doesn't enjoy beating up, running over, or shooting Nazis?).

2.) The graphics are pretty good (if I had a newer Graphics card they'd be even better).

3.) The overall gameplay is very entertaining.

4.) So what sets this game apart from every other action adventure game? The atmosphere. Nazi occupied Paris and the surrounding French countryside makes for great eye-candy. Granted, I'm only a quarter way through the game, but so far it's really fun.

CONS:

I have only two complaints. One big, one little...

1.) The bigger one is something so common in modern video games, I'm almost hesitant to even mention it. But it's just too annoying not to. The story is awful. Specifically the cut-scenes, or those short little movies that open and close every mission supposedly designed to advance the plot and characters, but feel more like excuses for the game developers to pretend they're screenwriters. Really bad screenwriters. The silly dialogue isn't just embarrassing, it's boring. Unfortunately, these little vignettes have AWESOME visuals (e.g. epic shots of Zeppelins flying over the city as fighter planes attack). Which means I either sit through unintentionally comical exchanges between poorly animated characters that pull me out of the game, or skip the cut-scenes altogether and miss out on the spectacular visuals, not to mention bits of vital information needed for the next mission.

2.) The smaller complaint is pretty small, but annoying for anyone who knows anything about World War II. The hero - the character we play the game as - is a tough, bar-brawling, explosives happy, Irishman. The only problem with this is that the Republic of Ireland never fought in World War II. Like Switzerland, they remained neutral throughout the entire war, making an Irishman an odd choice for the hero. On top of that, one of the hero's central allies is an Italian race car designer. Problem? Italy was on the German side of the war. Yes, the Italian people eventually overthrew Mussolini and welcomed the Allies. But again, an odd choice.

CONCLUSION: So long as you're not expecting the story-telling sophistication of BioShock, or the tongue-and-cheek dialogue of GTA, Saboteur offers a unique and fun world to play in.

The graphics are good in this game. Not fantastic, think sort of Bordelands/ Team Fortress 2. I would say this game is a lot more detailed than the two though. The customization allows you to do so much with the character. Scars, tatoos, facepaint and more. There are about 12 different items to choose from in each catagory, so it'll be hard to find someone exactly the same. The maps are bright and very straight to the point. Most maps are just paths to the objectives which makes sense. You have objective 1,2,3 and they are all laid perfectly on the map. Some people may not like this though as it may get old.

Gameplay is innovative but I think it may take a patch or two to get it perfect. I say this because it seems a bit unfinished. Yet with a little bit of fine tuning, this can be great! Not to say I don't like the gameplay because I like the new approach on things but it can be just a bit smoother. Such as sometimes I'll want to pull up my iron sites and it'll shoot first from the hip before pulling up. Small things though that shouldnt mess up the experience. The Parkour system works fine but will take a bit of getting used to. That is what makes this shooter unique and gives it a lot of potential. The gunplay is ok. Such as what I mentioned above, sometimes things just just don't happen as instant as you want. Could be just lag though, which I have experienced as well while playing the campaign online. So I wouldn't take any points away for this. The only full complaint I have is that the AI is HORRIBLE! If you play single player, Your teamates simply stand in a spot and shoot the other team. No movement or anything. At times they may help with the objective but I wouldn't count on it.

Sound- Sound is amazing. Every weapon sounds like it's supposed too and weapon attatchments have great sounds as well.

Replay Value- As far as this goes, If you want to earn every weapon attachment or even just gain more rank. You could play this game for a good 2 months before getting completely tired of it. There are about 8 maps and missions for each map. You also can play for each side (Resistance and Security Forces) campaign. Which can also add some replay value even though each mission is the exact opposite of the other factions. (ex- Security- gaurd this door, Resistance- Breach this door). With some DLC and maybe some weapon add-ons, this game will add a lot of extra time and fun, which I am looking forward to this.

Conclusion- This is a great game with potential. I only hope that this game doesn't go un-noticed. For people who love team based shooters, this is definetely the game for you. If you plan on playing solo, I would probably steer away from this game. It is team base and the AI isn't good enough at the moment to buy simply for single player gameplay. This shooter is VERY team based. Medics are so essential and everyone must play together and communicate. So if you plan on getting this be ready to do those things.

4.0,False,"02 9, 2011",A2X7UEC3H1KRF9,B001QZGVEC,A. Mesa,"I had written a review for this game but it was based on a bad install.  So I thought it would only be fair to re-write the review since I re-installed the game.  I've played quite a bit of strategy games (Company of Heroes, Civilization IV, etc).  And I have to say, I was intimidated with the controls and the level of micro-management the game required.  The game lacks a tutorial so you better read the manual.  There are also many nuances to the game that aren't explained very well in the manual so there is a lot of trial and error to see what works and what doesn't.  Luckily, you can save your progress at any time with as many saves slots you can handle.  Believe me, you'll need them as some of the missions are lengthy and difficult.

What I like about the game is you can decide for the most part on how to handle the mission.  There are a few stealth missions where you have to decide which guards to take out and/or which lights to shoot out.  Do you risk taking out a passing armoured vehicle or do you play it safe and hide.  The suspense is there, and you'll feel it.  This is an RTS, but unlike Company of Heroes where the computer seems to know where you are all the time, you can split up your squad and have them lay down in the bushes or behind a wall.  When an enemy soldier passes by you can knock them out or stab them with a knife to prevent the other guards from being notified to your location.  the game allows you to take ""Direct Control"" of units, in case you need them to use a particular weapon, or aim at a specific spot.

I do have a few gripes which amounted to deducting a star.

1.  The game needs a tutorial.  I almost gave up on the game the 1st day because I was so frustrated with the 1st few levels.
2.  Grenade throwing can be problematic.  Unless you've played the game for a while, you don't really know how far you need to be throw the grenade.  If you're too far, your soldier will come out of cover to get close enough.  Problematic when an MG42 is sitting there waiting.  This can be resolved a bit with Direct Control.
3.  Like one reviewer stated, you can accidentally move a unit you didn't intend to because you forgot to click off of him.  Or sometimes you'll throw a grenade instead of move into position because you had the wrong cursor highlighted.
4.  There are no queued commands.  For example, I want to have another soldier throw a grenade at the same time I do.  Or have one soldier take out a guard with a silent pistol at the same time I take out the 2nd soldier.  You can only seem to do things one right after the other and as fast as you can click on the 2nd soldier.

Even with the issues above, I've had a lot of fun playing the game.  This is after customizing the controls a bit and learning the nuances of the game.  The forums help out tremendously with some of the more difficult missions.  Although it can be frustrating, it doesn't compare to the satisfaction of completing a well planned mission.  Take the time to learn the game and you'll be rewarded.",Rewarding If You're Patient...,1297209600,2,,

3.75 Stars

 It's hard to rate a game that came out nearly 3 years ago. The main thing that stands in the way is that trying to compare the graphics is impossible, as we are light years ahead in 2016 than we were in 2013. And graphics would not be the biggest deal *IF* the story blows your mind. (More on that later)

Graphics -
The graphics have aged a bit, and I feel like the most obvious is plant textures. Nothing shows the age of a game more than trying to sneak through grass that is pixilated and literally 2 dimensional. That being said, this is still a fun Call of Duty game that holds up for the time being if you are feeling an itch for something new or forgotten before Infinite Warfare. It still looks and feels like a Call of Duty game, with graphics minimally better than previous generation hardware. Smoke, fire, clothing textures, hair, structures, guns, and skies all look great. The one thing that wasn't quite brought up to the Call of Duty new gen standard was facial rendering. Current Call of Duty games are very uncanny valley like with their uber realistic looking faces due their extensive use of motion capture technology. Ghosts seems to have a little more CGI-ness to the characters faces. I should say that at launch, Battlefield 4 felt breathtaking and everything looked so real that it felt unreal.  I wonder if maybe the game was rushed to launch as closely to the PS4 launch as possible? Maybe the use of ghosts masks was all just a clever marketing ploy because its less faces that they have to render. Anyways  I want to mention that there is a familiar face making a return as well.

On to the Gameplay-
 There are, as always, new toys (guns) to play with that are satisfying, and they aren't super futuristic like the trend Call of Duty is going towards.  I feel like this was the testing realm for Call of Duty to start stepping into the future, as there are some drones and futuristic technology used, but not overtly like combat robots and exo suits. In the story mode to mix it up you get to play as a German Sheppard with a Go Pro.(sometimes) Everything here feels like the tried and true Call of Duty formula of shoot bad guys, reload, rinse, repeat with different viewpoint or vehicle levels sprinkled in between. This may be good for those looking to get away from bionic exo suits with super human like abilities and wall running.

Story -
This is your typical action hero story in your typical post apocalyptic world with clear cut good guys and  bad guys. With a bad guy that they try to show why he went bad. This is all about avenging and, um revenging. People who know each other are backstabbing each other and drama drama drama. THE STORY SUCKS. They tried to do a Red Dawn style background with typical misunderstood rival drama that did not impress me. Unfortunately, I feel like the good story in Call of Duty games left at the first Black Ops.

Multiplayer 
This is what I was looking forward to coming back to the game a few years later. The good news? No Hackers! Yay! The bad news? Theres about 20 percent of the Black Ops 3 general server population playing this game online. That amounts to about 3,000 people online vs Black Ops 3s 16,000. Keep in mind that the 3000 number fluctuates and is a generous estimate. When I got online, mostly everyone was playing Team Deathmatch and exactly ONE person was playing Ground Wars. Pretty sad stuff. But hey, you get the season pass with this version! Some of the maps are actually really cool, like the Free Fall map where you play on a falling skyscraper and another one where you play in a bay with a pirate ship.

Other Modes 
Squads: Pretty much abandoned at this point as there are not many people online. Used to create squads to face each other in mixed AI mode gameplay.
Extinction: This is a new take on Zombies and its actually really cool. This is a wave style game mode where you have to survive waves of Aliens into progressingly larger spaces. If you can find friends to play it with still, you should enjoy it.
Hardened Edition Extras: You get an actually really cool paracord bracelet with a little skull ghosts logo, the Season pass for all of the multiplayer maps, and an OST voucher code. (who would listen to a Call of Duty OST? Halo OST is where its at!!)

Summary -  3.75 stars. Its still a fun Call of Duty game with slightly aged graphics, a mind numbing single player story, a dwindling online population, and a fun new mode called Extinction. It also comes with the season pass so you could play on every map they came out with.

**TL/DR** For a Call of Duty game on a next gen console under 20 dollars with the season pass, you will get enough enjoyment out of it to justify the price.

4.0,False,"03 27, 2005",A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B0001XMA6I,D. Roberts,"If you want a role playing game in the STAR WARS environment, this game may well be worth checking out.  You get to be one of several classes of warriors playing on multiple maps spread out across the STAR WARS galaxy.  Most all the familiar SW planets are represented here, including Tatooine, Hoth, Naboo, Rhen Var and others.

One of the surprising things about the game is that you can even choose which side you fight on.  Want to be a stormtrooper?  No problem.  Want to be a Wookie?  Go for it!  Want to be a droid from THE PHANTOM MENACE? Have fun!

Each side has different classes, including snipers, rocket launchers, mortar launchers, close-quarters rifles & more.  Each map favors a different class.  Snipers are good in maps where there is wide open space - especially if  you can get a high position overlooking the enemy.  Rocket launchers are good vs. enemy vehicles.  Mortar launchers are good inside narrow halls where the enemy combatants are unable to get away from the grenades.

One of the funnest things about the game is commandeering vehicles.  Actually, one of the most effective ways to kill the enemy is to simply run over them.  It's fun to be the ""mad driver"" in a combat landspeeder, mowing down stormtroopers.  Apparently there are no traffic laws in the SW universe....

You are able to get into starfighters as well (X-Wing fighters, Y-Wing figthers, Tie fighters, etc), but I've found trying to shoot down enemy starfighters with a mouse & keyboard to be next to impossible.

The game has a few drawbacks.  First of all, the directions re: gameplay are generic & incomplete.  They don't cover all classes.  For example, I still haven't figured out how to use the jetpack, and I can't find any information on it in the handbook or on-screen instructions.

Secondly, Jedi knights are obnoxiously powerful.  Yes, they should be more powerful than regular classes.  However, on this game they are invincible.  It gets frustrating when you empty your entire arsenal on a Jedi only to have him nonchalantly waltz over and get you with a light saber.  To my knowledge there are only 2 ways to kill a Jedi:  (1):  Run over him at high speed with a land speeder.  (2):  Blow them off the side of a catwalk with a grenade.  Other than that, it's actually best to simply avoid Jedi knights on the other team.

All in all, this game is a lot of fun.  A few of the maps are fun to play over & over & over again.  If you're into STAR WARS and / or role-playing combat games, this one is worth picking up!","Not quite Jedi level, but pretty fun",1111881600,8,,
4.0,True,"08 25, 2006",ALT8OCGC2LVQ9,B000B6ML28,Paul Mosier,"PGR 3 is a game that will not overwhelm you in terms of features. There are only 80 cars and many of them are widely unknown. That said, the graphics are definitely next gen. Shading and light are magnificently combined with sharp, crisp lines and an overall very realistic game. In fact, if you look in the mirrors of the cars you can actually see the real background going past. With five distinct camera viewpoints one will definitely suit you. Physics are sort of realistic, but seem rather simple; most likely based on weight and power. Something that impressed me was the engine sounds; they were considerably different from car to car, but still need some work on the V8 vehicles. You start out with 85,000 credits and have the choice of some ten to fifteen cars at first.

It is clearly an arcade style game and I hate to compare it to the Gran Turismo series, but to me it is a standard which pretty much every other racing game is held to. It falls well short. A kudos system is still used as was in the first and second PGR, which is a thing that when you do powerslides and other crazy driving you get kudos points which I'm not really sure what they do. The only thing I can gather is some of the races involve getting a large amount of kudos in order to finish. I think that is ludicrous-it is a racing game not tokyo street drift. There is an online mode where you can watch other people race or race them yourself. I do not subscribe to xbox live, but I imagine this adds another valuable dimension to the game. In the solo career mode you start with a couple of cities and different challenges are afforded to you-speed camera, cone challenge, street race. There are five game difficulties: hardcore, hard, medium, easy, beginner. For each successive difficulty you gain more credits for completing the challenges.

What I have a problem with is the fact that a car that costs 50,000 credits drives faster and manuvers better than the 300,000 credit Ferrari. The second thing I see wrong with the game is the actual cars. Makers of PGR3 only put cars on the game that have a top speed of 170 mph. That is good and all but you feel kind of like basically Ferrari and Lamborghini are using the game as an advertisement. I would say 25% or more of all the cars on the game are just these. Of course they are amazing race cars but I want to see some more cars that I have heard of. There are plenty of amazing cars electronically limited which I'm sure could easily top out and 170 mph or better. Maybe it is just because I'm used to simulation games where you have fifty car makers are able to customize everything from the air filter to the muffler for more power. What was done most poorly on PGR3 was the illusion of speed, everything seems slower than it should. In the end the game is fun but falls short of what I expected. What I would do to improve the game is add more car makers, better known cars and at least the ability to upgrade the engine. Overall I would give it a 7 out of 10.",Life Begins at 170?

The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that it fails ""perfection"" in ""shooting feel.""  That's subjective, I understand, but it feels a little bit ""sloppy"" in the way, say, that Battlefield Bad Company felt to me.  Not as tight as COD4 or Left 4 Dead, for example.  The other quibble is what I imagine MMO and RPG players call as ""grinding.""  I understand RPGs and loved games like Fallout 3 but after a while the scags get to be a little dull.

Still, this is a different kind of game.  Really, it stands alone.  It does so many of the little things right.  It saves everything.  You lose virtually nothing, no matter when you quit.  You can drop in and out of any game with your character, keeping cash and loot and exp you gather along the way.

This seems so obvious, but it's something other games fail miserably at.  Are you listening Bungie, with your half-arsed ODST effort?  Why could I only play with friends and recent players?  Why couldn't I drop in on another person's game?  Why did we have to be in a lobby first?

How can I fairly review a game  that has resided on my hard drive since the very day it was released? For  the technical minded, Half-Life (H-L) is based on a modified Quake 2  engine, but the modifications simply blow Quake away in almost every  aspect. Valve made an excellent move with this choice. It is well known in  the gaming community that Quake's engine has some of the most stable  networking code in the business. Too bad the video compatibility is a  little odd. For the gamer at heart, this game may have a . . . half life  longer than Quake itself. Valve made a good move allowing the gaming  community to have the WorldCraft level editor and other SDK software. What  this means to the average player is that a simple jaunt to a good web page,  will yield every manner of new levels, characters, and baddies to download  and install to their hearts content. And with Valve's Op-for expansion  pack, this game will take up a large amount of space on a lot of hooked  players' computers.
One of the most notable modifications to Half Life is  the apparently intelligent enemies. Shoot the ""dogs"" and they'll  run for cover and regroup with their pals. Let the marines see or hear you  and they'll drop a hand grenade on your head. Ninja's don't just run into  you, they jump over your head and land behind you. Crabs pop up at the most  inconvenient times. A well designed level and a poorly designed level is  differentiated by the ""intelligence"" of the enemies. Although the  modifications are great, they are certainly predictable to an extent. Play  the game enough and you'll eventually spot patterns to the enemies  ""thinking"".
So of course, after defeating the game forward and  backwards it would be time to test the Quake engine network code. Needless  to say, a 56k modem is NOT recommended. Even though with my experience the  network game play is better than the Unreal engine, the modem does this  game sad justice. Hopping up to anything better than a 56k modem really  makes this game shine. Valve has multi-player levels packed right in with  this game, nice big areas with lots of weapons make this game a fun  ""frag-fest"". The levels don't have that disgusting  ""dark"" feel to them. Underground levels have suitable colors and  lighting. Out door levels have an expansive feeling (although no where near  the ""out door"" feeling that Unreal does so well). Too bad that  H-L has compatibility problems with various video cards.
It's really not  so much compatibility problems it's really more that valve's default  settings for the are usually not the correct settings. (The voodoo video  family suffers the worst from this.) By default the video gamma is far too  bright for the voodoo 2 card. The decals have the incorrect value. Lighting  don't appear correctly. And SLI seems to have an odd effect on the game.  Most cards have their unique set of problems, and all of these adjustments  have to be done at the command level. Not something to be done by the  average gamer.
And this game screams to be played by all gamers. With  many advanced gamers using the enclosed Software Developer's Kit (SDK) and  WorldCraft to make new levels, and in some cases, completely new games.  Valve guaranteed H-L's place in the gaming community. Even if the average  player has no idea how to use the software to create new levels, they can  still go to numerous web sites and download any number of home made levels.  The  Opposing Force expansion pack and the upcoming Gunman game are direct  descendants of users and their Valve's SDK That are purchasable in the  store while hot downloads like They Hunger and D.S.S. Darkstar add free  life to the game.
This leads up to the final gripe with H-L, though not a  major one. I have the Team Fortress Classic (TFC) expansion, the Opposing  Force pack and numerous ""user made"" levels and my directory  continues to grow. Currently the space taken by H-L and the various packs,  levels, and extras has reached 912 MB of space. In contrast Diablo 2 (Full  installation) is 1.10 GB, while Diablo 1 is only 10.1 MB! The game's are  growing guys and gals, so the PC requirements should be followed like a  bible.
All in all I would have given more than five stars if the system  would have allowed me to do so. But I admit I had to take at least one star  away, I did this to force a point onto most people who wish to own a copy  of H-L. The game can be played right of the box but to get the full effect  of the game, you're going to need to edit the auto start and configuration  files. Voodoo 2 owners used to have the H-L Voodoo Doctor but alas, I have  not seen his web page in months. H-L really does not like the Voodoo card.  ATI Rage Fury does a little better, but you'll get a bizarre  ""ghost"" on occasion. The TNT family does the best out of the  bunch with the default values. I understand Valve is working on this issue  in H-L 2 (TFC 2?)  but we'll have to wait and see. Congrats Valve, this  game shoved Quake, Quake 2, Unreal, and Duke Nukem 3D permanently off of my  drive. I've since gotten a dual 13 GB drive configuration (26 GB total),  I've never even bothered to dust off those games. With the purchase of  Bungee software by Microsoft (Please God, Don't let Halo and Oni be X-Box  only games.) , the Multi-Player nature of Quake 3, and Duke Nukem (with the  Unreal engine) on a perpetual release date, H-L will be a tough game to  knock off the ""Game of the Year"" throne. Has H-L cursed the first  person shooter genre? Are developers afraid to knock the king out of the  ring? It may look that way.","Hot Da.... uh, er, What a great game!",967939200,9,,

However once I re-set the controls to something a bit easier for me to remember & spent time getting used to them, I became instantly engrossed in the story line and had a great time solving the mystery of Dead Reefs.

In this game you play Sir Amadey Finvinero, an investigator who was sent to Dead Reefs to determine the true cause of death for the Baron's son - was it really an accident or was it murder?  And if this young man was murdered, who was behind it and why?  Could it be related to the curse - a curse the locals believe was put on Dead Reefs due to its' past, when pirates would lure passing ships onto the reefs and loot their cargo as the ships & their inhabitants would sink to their deaths?

In order to solve this mystery you'll find yourself exploring mansions, underground passageways, crypts, grave-yards, old ships and more.

Overall, I thought the story-line & graphics were great and, other than the frustration with the controls, I found this to be a really fun and engrossing game to play.

I loved the atmosphere, the visuals, sound, AI, guns... All very satisfying. The story was decent for a video game, but I read a book or movie when I want a good story. Games don't usually deliver for me in that category.

Extraction Point, like most have said, is more of what you liked about the original. The developers weren't very daring. They really didn't add much to the story, and they left the gameplay  formula alone. 2 or 3 new types of bad guys- cool. Some new locales... sweet. The 2 new guns were very nice, but as someone else said, the ammo is scarce, which is a shame. It would have been a lot of fun to go on a total rampage with both of those guns for a decent stretch of time. For instance... one of my favorite game-moments was near the end of Half-life 2, when you have nothing except the super-charged gravity gun, and you are just going absolutely berserk with it. FEAR needs moments like that.

This expansion was brief, which some have complained about. It took me like 5 or 6 hours on medium, and that fit the bill nicely. Admittedly, I may have a shorter attention span then some, but I was satisfied.

Another thing that some have complained about is the system requirements. FEAR looked gorgeous and played very smoothly on my puter. Here, they ramped up output, and I had a pretty tough time tweaking it. This actually frustrated me until I checked online, and discovered that it wasn't just me. It picked a level of settings for me, and it looked real nice, but when a little action hit the screen, the game stuttered horribly. I had to sacrifice quite a bit of eye candy, to be able to make this game play well. Expansions don't usually challenge your system that much more than the original game.

Yeah, there is the crowd which has far more impact than previously, but otherwise it might seem like a port with better graphics. Its far from that though. The improvements made have significant influence on how well the game plays and how enjoyable it is.

The feature set is identical to the 360/PS3. Ultimate Team content can be transferred back and forth between 360 and One or PS3 and PS4.

There are two things that stood out prominently for me based on past frustrations with the series. AI controlled players are much more aggressive in going after the ball rather than how they would often just stand there and let an opponent intercept a pass or reach a ball in space first. The other is the ability to better hold on to possession. Instead of having a defender all over the ball-handler constantly, those defenders can be better maneuvered around and the opponent made to pay for being out of position or taking too many risks.

A good part of the excitement on the show is the different personalities and Howie's comments to the people and all the silliness.  The voice of Howie Mandel is real in the game, but there's no way to have the interaction and the give and take that you have on the show.  That said, if you were playing the game with other people in the room watching in 1 player mode, or playing one of the custom games with up to 5 players, the conversation on your end might supply the party atmosphere that you see on the show.

Everything is otherwise much like it is on the show, with the audience, the banker, etc. and you can play with your Mii which I thought was kind of a nice touch.  The one thing I was not impressed with is the graphics.  Howie looks similar to the real Howie, but there are lots of ragged edges to the graphics.  They should be smooth.  I'm playing on a big screen TV and using component cables, but the graphics were rough enough that I went back to check my settings to make sure that I had it set to 480p instead of 480i.  For me, graphics in a Wii game don't have to be fancy, but the ragged edges are distracting.  Maybe on a smaller screen it would be less noticeable.  I posted some photos under the customer images, but it's kind of hard to see since they reduce the size here, but have a look anyway.

There are several options in the custom games that can be played with up to 5 players.  There's a Special Event where you can have from 2 to 13 $1,000,0000 cases.  There are also challenges in the 1 player mode like the Variety Ladder where your play one game of each special event type and try to win as much as you can, or Risky Business where you have to win increasingly larger amounts to keep playing.  In the Banker's Challenge you play 3 games in a row against computer opponents where the first game is against one, the second against 2 and the third against 3.  Again, you try to win as much as possible.

There are some mini games included such as Sharpshooter where you shoot the cases, Blackjack which plays like the card game but instead of 21 you're playing to $2,100 and instead of cards, you're dealt cases.  There's also a Marathon that has you playing each mini-game in random order, trying to score as much cash as you can.  It's probably good that they have the mini-games since playing Deal or No Deal would get boring after a while.

All in all, I think for the price it's a reasonably good game except I wish the graphics were more smoothly rendered.  I think it would be a good game at a party, even with only one player at a time because the interaction would make it more like the TV show.

I really did enjoy it, but it was somewhat different from the other games. You play Nancy (of course) who goes to Paris to assist a nutty fashion designer. Here is my take of the game.

Story: The story was interesting. It came across as  being slightly far-fetched, but most ND stories are. That is part of what makes them so much fun. The story was developed well, and all of the characters were very engaging if a bit weird.

Puzzles: None of the puzzles in this game were all that difficult. I did have trouble with one, but I never had to consult a walk through or anything like that. Most of them were just common sense and were a moderate level of difficulty.

Graphics: The graphics were very realistic and enjoyable. I especially enjoyed exploring the catacombs and swimming underwater.

Ending: VERY far-fetched. So far-fetched that it was a little painful actually. Not the best ending that I think they could have come up with.

Overall: This game is well worth the money if you can get past the ending  and the fact that the puzzles are not all that difficult. If you are new to the ND games, I wouldn't start with this one.

They were programmable from a Windows PC and had some decent sound settings to isolate footsteps, etc.  These only have very basic settings, so if you are a serious gamer who wants to isolate sounds, like footsteps, look elsewhere.

These are decent headphones, but they only have four basic sound settings, normal, treble, bass, and treble & bass.  There is also a four stop limiter button to cut out sounds that are too loud from damaging your eardrums.

The chat is bluetooth, but PS4 doesn't support it as of yet.  So, the PX4's use a cable to connect to the controller for chat until bluetooth is enabled.

Be sure to change the PS4 device output settings on the controller to only chat, not all, because ""all audio"" switches off the optical out.  You can control the volume and sound (chat or all) sent to the controller by pressing the PS button on the controller and selecting devices.  The volume change happening in a PS4 menu is a pain.  So, I have mine set to max, and adjust the main sound down.  The PX4's do use a overall volume logic with the limiter button so that top end volume is cut back if things get too loud.

When bluetooth is enabled on the PS4, you should be able to use the mute, and volume control buttons.  Oh, why buttons for chat volume?  Was a dial that much more expensive to include? (there is a dial for the main volume, but not for the chat volume)

I had some cutting out of power on the transmitter, not sure what was happening there.  I thought it may have been problems between the USB 3.0 outlet and what appears to be a USB 2.0 plug from the transmitter.  I plugged the transmitter into a PC USB outlet that is always on, and that problem seems to have gone away.  (Or, it could have been I wasn't using the headphones and it shut off.  I noticed the transmitter turns on when I turn on the headset and turns off when I turn off the headset.)

Sound quality:  Decent enough. I didn't notice any transmission interference like I did with the PX5s.
Build: Cheaper than the PX5s, the cup of which eventually broke and survived by using plastic ties to engineer a fix.  No customizable sound settings, i.e., no darth vader or chipmunk voices....

The internal battery is a plus. I used rechargeables with my PX5's, and changing out batteries and recharging was getting old.  The drawback will be the battery life and having to replace it with something proprietary from TB.

Cons: chat cable is a temporary measure until Bluetooth is enabled, but expect Sony to fix the Bluetooth in the near future once other bugs are fixed.  No verbal menu cues , ""Powering Off"", ""Bluetooth Powering On"", etc.  You only get a series of beeps only R2D2 would understand....I'll figure it out.

I suppose the PX4 will compete with the Sony PS headsets, and they are similarly priced (more expensive though).  I don't have a pair of the Sonys so, I can't do a comparison.  They do sound decent.

Bottom line:  They are a good but cheap version of a high end headset.  They also work with the PS4 (although currently you have to use the chat cable until the PS4's bluetooth is enabled for chat).",Previous PX5 Owner,1385251200,2,,

The ruberized feel gives you the satisfying feeling that you won't drop the controller when getting yourself into a tense fire fight. The backlit ""Hyperesponse"" buttons allow for VERY quick depressions with little effort and the placement of the back/ start buttons feel more natural then the OEM controller. Adding to the button mashing goodness is the addition of the extra programmable shoulder buttons (which I use for spotting and use/action in Battlefield 3), giving me a slight edge on keeping my sights mobile without taking my thumbs off the analog sticks. Speaking off, the adjustable tension resistance on the analog sticks allow you to turn up the sensitivity in-game and give you more precise aiming.

Cons: Unfortunately, my controller has been plagued with problems. First, my right analog stick began to hold right and unwantingly pull. Very bad when sniping and especially terrible when you add to the fact that the in-game weapons will recoil and pull your sights. So I exchanged it for a new one. Second, once I finally got my new controller, it took less then three hours of play for my left stick to suddenly stop going up and depress the L3 on it's own. So now I'm on my third controller and with all said, I'm still very happy with it.

It runs cool and it is fairly quiet, excluding the disc drive which is insanely loud (think tower PC rom-drive spinning at 48x).  I have already ordered the starter kit with a 60gb hdd so I can load the games I am playing currently.  The performance has been flawless so far.  No lag.  I actually liked the old xbox live layout better I think (it seemed easier to navigate), but the newer features are a must.

My only real complaint right now is that the bottom-right corner of the faceplate doesn't snap down all the way.  It is no biggie, but it just makes the console seem cheap, although I know the cpu and gpu are nothing to laugh at (even at 3 years old, although the nm have shrunk).  Speaking of hardware, I actually think MS went the better way with their machine than Sony.  At $200-300 for a console, I will be happy if it lasts 5 years (I spent a grand on my tower PC a year and a half ago and already it seems out of date with the i7 intels making the core 2 duo's look like a joke).  At the rate computers are advancing, it doesn't make sense to design a 10-year machine like the PS3 is suppossed to be.  MS will gain further market share if it brings out a new system by 2011 that will of course be superior to anything now, and blu-ray will be much cheaper then also.  I also hope they end the hard disk drive system for a bigger solid state internal memory (maybe 8 or 16 gigs), and they can sell an external 3.5"" HDD with a terabyte for the downloading types.  Oh, and it better have wi-fi built in, especially since they are pushing on-line play so hard.  That is a shameless ploy to sell those outrageously priced adapters.  The wi-fi adapter at retail costs HALF what the base console does?  Absolutely ridiculous.  In fact, MS would be wise to stop or at least lessen the 'nickel-and-dime' trend they have been on.  It generates cash revenue, but at a cost to consumer satisfaction.  The DVD adapter on the first Xbox was the worst of all time.  Sell the remote to people who want one, but do not block DVD playback to force buying the adapter.  I could not believe that one.  Sony would never stoop so low.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"While good ol' Crash Bandicoot has expanded his horizons on the Playstation 2 and Xbox, Vicarious Visions seems to have decided to hold back for the marsupial's then-latest Game Boy Advance title, Crash Purple. On the surface, it seems like it would be a pretty epic crossover between Crash and Spyro; after all, the two have been seen as partners/rivals ever since they gained dominance over the Playstation as unofficial mascots. Unfortunately, what we're provided with here is not anything that a regular Crash Bandicoot platformer can't triumph over...because platforming is not this game's ideal gameplay.

Crash Purple is a collection of minigames that consist of various different gameplay styles, such as hopping on crates, riding to the goal, jet tubing, navigating via tank, etc, while the usual platforming formula is demoted to glorified HUB worlds. Yes, this is what the formation of a Spyro and Crash crossover has led up to. To be fair, though, a lot of the minigames aren't half-bad. They all have an emphasis on arcade-style mechanics and simplicity, basically serving as bite-sized levels that happen to shift between different types of gameplay. That said, you better make sure you get all the Crystals (by beating the minigames) and Gems (by smashing all the crates in the minigames), because unlike the previous GBA Crash games where you just get a not-so-ceremonious ending without collecting them, this game WILL NOT let you progress to the final part without them.

What also helps add to this cartridge is that, just like the GBA version of Crash Nitro Kart, there's a hidden minigame that is accessed by holding L and R while booting up the game. That minigame is called Spyro Party USA, which is literally Crash Party USA from Nitro Kart, except with Spyro dancing onscreen instead of Crash. Nevertheless, it's a simple and fun rhythm game with addictive qualities to it such as the Crash-esc music enhanced by electronic beats, and the nature of the rhythm genre in general.

As for Crash Purple as a whole? It's a fun game, but I personally prefer its predecessors if you want a great Crash experience on the go.",Not exactly what you may have wished for,1433635200,,,

The game play is rapid and fluid, if you are palyed ""Virtual Fighter"" or one of the first ""Takken"" game, you know how the fights in a DOA game looks like, you fights with combos of punches and kicks, the most of character can't jump, but you can throws your enemies and make a great variety of combos, actually when you make a combo sometimes you don't know exactly what kind of combo expect 'couse the fight is very rapid.

4.0,False,"12 29, 2015",A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B00DB9JV5W,V. Berk,"Halo 5: Guardians is, of course, the highly anticipated fifth installment in the core Halo franchise on Xbox One.  You cant say Xbox without Halo (Im sure its in the fine print somewhere).  The MJOLNIR armored Master Chief has become the icon of Microsofts system since 2001 when Halo: Combat Evolved launched alongside the original Xbox.  High hopes were built on Halo 5: Guardians with the largest marketing campaign on a Halo an outstanding Hunt the Truth ads (which, sadly, isn't much of a factor in the game itself).

Since taking over from franchise creators Bungie in 2010, the internal 343 Industries has proven divisive with decisions in Halo 4 and Halo 5: Guardians, but I feel that, for the most part, theyve shown that they're fans of Bungies original games, but also want to tell new stories.  It would have been easier (and perhaps more fan friendly) if theyd stuck to Master Chief fighting the Covenant and Flood indefinitely, so I'm happy to see they're willing to take risks with the property.

Short Review:
Halo 5: Guardians is a the best looking game on Xbox One and offers an outstanding update to the franchises gameplay and a must have for any Xbox One owners, but some fans may be disappointed by the weaker campaign story.

Long Review
Story-  Following the events of Halo 4, the UNSC has and Elite forces led by the Arbiter are on the verge of defeating the Covenant Remnant.  Spartan 117 (the Master Chief) has been reunited with the surviving members of Blue Team (long-time fans will know them from expanded universe novels) and is in the process of finishing an op when suddenly he has a vision of former AI companion Cortana.  His loyal squadmates at his side, the Chief sets out to find Cortana without any warning.  Alarmed by his departure, and with the ominous Prometheans on the move again, the UNSC dispatches Osiris Team, a new generation of Spartan IVs led by Spartan Locke, to bring the Master Chief back.

Now that the introductions out of the way, whats new in Halo 5?  Well, for starters, this is the first main-series Halo game since Halo 2 that puts players in the armor of someone other than the Master Chief: Spartan Locke.  Also along for the ride are the members of Master Chiefs Blue Team and Lockes Osiris Team (including Buck played by the always enjoyable Nathan Fillion, last seen in Halo 3: ODST).  The game also features the return of The Arbiter (voiced to perfection, as always, by Keith David), and a wonderful new AI character named

Yes.  Does it deliver?  Yes, and no.  Yes it delivers giant set pieces, awesome vehicles, and gunplay we all know and love, but the campaign is flawed.
Sadly that Hunt the Truth campaign turned out to be grossly misleading (but I won't deduct points from the game for it-- marketing team does their job, devs do theirs).

Lets get this out of the way: There are problems with Locke, but they're not the reason many negative reviews have been calling out.  Ive seen numerous reviews calling Locke boring, one-dimensional  you know, the exact same reasons critics (see: buzzkills) insulted Master Chief in Bungies original trilogy.  People criticizing Locke seem quick to forget that Master Chief didn't even show much humanity until Halo 4 (traces here and there in Halo 3, but not enough to dispel the illusion).  So, no, the problem with Spartan Locke isn't his curt, military personality.  Halo 5s narrative problem is that Spartan Locke doesnt have personal stakes in the hunt for Master Chief.

The greatest problem is that I don't feel as if I experienced a full story (.  Halo 4 started 343s Reclaimer Saga and, while clearly setting up the plot threads for future games, I still felt like a complete experience.  Halo 5 feels like the first step in what could be a great story, but one that well have to wait 2-3 years to see the payoff (up to 6 years if we have to wait for  Halo 7 to finish off these plot threads).

(P.S. The other problem people have with Halo 5 is the villain.  I won't go into spoilers, but, in all honesty: I didn't mind the choice 343i made for the antagonist.  If anything, Im happy they're willing to try new things with the Halo franchise.)

(P.P.S. Yes, the game ends on a cliffhanger, and yes its annoying but not as annoying as Halo 2s cliffhanger ending.  I think people are wearing nostalgia goggles if they're 2 did a cliffhanger better)

Music  Composer Kazuma Jinnouchi (Metal Gear Solid 4) provides an outstanding score that captures the epic qualities of Martin ODonnells original score, while also allowing room for Junnouchi to leave his own musical stamp on the series.  (Note: Jinnouchi began work as 343s music supervisor with Halo 4, but only was able to compose a few tracks.  This is his first time composing a complete Halo game)

Graphics  Halo 5: Guardians is a honking 60+GB download (almost as the 4 game Master Chief Collection last year), so, suffice to say, this is the most graphically advanced Halo game ever made.  If you want a game that will showcase the Xbox One at its best this is a no-brainer.

Gameplay  Top notch.  This is Halo for a new generation.  Diehard fans nostalgic for Halo 2 will undoubtedly find reasons to complain, but, from my perspective, this is Halo gameplay for 2015.  Some people feared that the ability to look down the sights would make Guardians Halo: Call of Duty, but I couldn't disagree more (besides: good Halo players will still play without looking down the sights a single time).

Multiplayer  Im not much of a Halo multiplayer, despite having been a fan for over a decade now (shocking, I know).  From what Ive played its been fun.  Im sure hardcore devotees of Halo 2 and 3 multiplayer have things to complain about, but as someone who only plays multiplayer casually, Ive had lots of fun with Halo 5s multiplayer.

Verdict   Halo 5: Guardians is a good game in a great series, and although its campaign won't rank among the series best entries its still a must-own for Xbox One (with fingers crossed that Halo 6 and 7 fully deliver on the storylines introduced in 5).",Looking to the Future,1451347200,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Not expecting much, after playing the demo I immediately could tell this game had potential to be a very fun game, and right I was! For a measley $20, I also recieved a Starsky And Hutch ""LP"" for free, and enjoyed a game with quite a bit of replayability and adrenaline pumping action.
Playing the solo version is fluid, intuitive and fun.  You car handles wonderfully and the the cinematic jumps, explosions and auto-aiming shooting function works great.  As far as shooting while driving, it's not about aiming, but your timing in regards to when you pull the trigger.  When your recticle turns red, you get a critical hit and a bump in VR points.  When it's yellow on an enemey target, you still do damage but not nearly as much.
You have to earn so many police ""badges"" of a specific level to move on to the next ""season."" And by collecting ""Huggy Cards"" in missions and various weapon power-up's, and achieving particular final VR ratings new modes open up for you in the game. Free roam is fairly bland but worthwhile as you simply collect badges placed around town and in many instances require you to make stunt jumps to get them.  You have to do this without running out of VR points, and are rewarded VR points for collecting each one.  The ""TV Episode"" mode is a lot of fun, consisting of things like races where you try and take out other cars and of course avoid the citizens and scenery as you go...but it doesn't mean you can't be a little reckless as the game is fairly forgiving and the controls are excellent.
The Havok engine looks good and the graphics do a great job of providing realistic physics and nice explosions and an immersive, big city to drive around in.  In fact the city is absolutely huge, yet the game performs without a hitch, unlike, say, GTA3.  There are no loading times while you're in-game.
Over-all the game is a treat for the money, it's not a deep, open-ended game like GTA3, but it does a great job of being faithful to the 70's TV series, has great 70's music and voice over's from the characters.

Pros
- Tons of characters through the Majin Buu saga
- Decent control scheme
- Graphics are pretty good
- Enough game modes for a fighting game

Cons
- No DBGT characters (Super Saiyan 4 Goku/Vegeta? SSJ4 Gogeta? Pleaseeeee?)
- No ""story"" mode
- Galaxy mode will take you a long...long...time, and there isn't much variety
- Trophies are ridiculous (PS3)
- Teen & Kid Gohan's voice is not from the English dub, but from a new dub called Dragon Ball Z Kai (and I much prefer the Teen Gohan from the Ocean dub)

So really, here's the verdict:

If you're dying for some of the new characters (like SSJ3 Vegeta and SSJ3 Broly) or you simply want a bigger cast from the original Raging Blast, you will enjoy this game. The lack of a story mode is disappointing, even though Galaxy Mode gives some SLIGHT tie-ins to the series (for example, the Boss Battle for Teen Gohan is Perfect Cell; the Boss for Scouter Vegeta is Frieza, etc). All in all, I recommend doing the tutorial to figure out how to perform most moves, but once you have the controls down you can fly all over and make fancy attacks. It's a little repetitive, but hey, Dragonball Z is all about the attacks.

Gameplay can get monotonous after a spate of 3 or 4 dungeons or so. Enemies haven't varied themselves too much yet, maybe i need to get farther along.

I will explain why in my cons section, don't get me wrong I was immersed and have never experienced anything like it but right away I had a issue that I will go into detail later, will list my pros and cons than end it with my final thoughts and the big VR elephant in the room Adult entertainment!

Pros: COMFORT, it is very comfortable to wear I forget I even have it on at times. VALUE, now this is a tough one but considering what other VR  headsets are going for the PSVR launch bundle is a decent value at this time however I see the price of all headsets going down rather quickly. GAMES, again some would argue but honestly theres a lot of game choices out there for launch of the PSVR, compared to most launch day consoles etc...although theres not that killer app as most would say but there are killer experiences already and more to come soon. SOCIAL, can set up in living room and pass around to friends/family seamlessly, looking forward to this Thanksgiving! IMMERSION, Its there u almost feel like u are some place else not sitting on your couch, and honestly I felt like I was really moving when diving under water or riding roller coaster, not sure how but had that sensation which I wasn't expecting to be so strong.

Cons: The reason I wasn't blown away when I first put it on was because of resolution, I didn't know what to expect, never tried other VR's etc... so I had this idea in my mind that it would be like when you are watching lets plays of psvr on youtube, but honestly most those look better than what you actually see inside headset. You are immersed in a 3D world so it is alot different than watching it but you also are a lot closer and see every flaw. Yeah its 1080p but its pressed right up to your eyeball lol, now from what I have read/watched even the higher end Rift and Vive have resolution issues even with higher resolution and they have much worse screen door effect which is barely noticeable on the PSVR.

The easiest way to explain it is I have to wear contacts and it almost looks like I'm not wearing them when in VR but no amount of squinting will make it look better. Stuff real close to you looks good, cockpits, guns, people if close etc... but it falls off the farther things get and pretty quick imo. This may be a deal breaker for some and almost was for me but after doing research on other headsets etc... I have a feeling this is just how its going to be for this 1st generation of VR headsets, I do think its amazing and when fully immersed the resolution or whatever doesn't really matter, and also the more I have used it the more I get use to it. and yes I did the eye to eye measurment etc... pretty sure did everything I could to get the best experience but it is what it is and its not a deal breaker for me now.

So theres my pros and cons, only one con could of mentioned wires but not a huge con for me, now lets talk about PSVR outside of gaming, I truly believe that for this 1st gen vr headset to be a big success is that Sony will have to embrace that this is more than just for gaming, needs better quality videos than whats out there now imo, some are decent but so far even with issues games look better to me and they need to update the PSVR to support web3D browser and VR3D video, I believe right now its only VR2D and yes that all comes full circle with the Big Ol Elephant in the VR room Adult Content!

My only problem with this game is the lighting - a few levels of dark spooky cooridors is fine, but after a while it gets tedious to fumble between a flashlite and your weapons.

The x-box live is pretty bad.  Most sessions have lagged pretty badly (not nearly as smooth as Halo 2's live).  I wouldn't recommend this game if you already have the PC version and you just want to play your friends on x-box live.

Finally, I bought the collector's edition for the original Doom.  It consoled well to x-box, and I found it a blast to relive the game I first played ten years ago.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have shelled out the extra ten bucks.

I don't enjoy racing much but find myself addicted to this title.  The many things you're able to do to influence your final score -- jump, runs through the trees, smashing into other trucks -- make this game very worthwhile and an awful lot of fun.

Audience:  Again, this may not be for hardcore racing fans.  For nearly everyone else, though, the action is great.  The gamers and non-gamers alike in my family have enjoyed the versus mode racing.

Graphics:  Great for the Wii.  No complaints here--the scenery is great and even looks pretty good when you're flying by at a zillion MPH.

Gameplay: You win or lose a race based on the number of stars you collect in the course.  You get stars for winning, of course, but also for other things like running through trees and catching a lot of air on jumps.  The single player mode is a lot of fun, though I wish there was more to it than just ""get X amount of stars on every race.""  That's not exactly something that will get me drawn into a single player mode.  Multiplayer is 2 players only but is quite a bit of fun, though the fact that there are no NPC racers is a drawback.

Control:  Control is pretty easy once you get the hang of it, but tilting the Wiimote to steer is not something that comes intuitively for most people used to other consoles.  Still, the control is great and a racing wheel makes it even more fun.

Challenge:  The challenge is there, but I'm not sure it's what I would like to see.  Instead of new objectives to complete you just do the same objectives you've already done and try to get a higher star count.

Concerns:  A couple of things I think could be better on this game.  First would be a season or career type mode--anything to liven up the single player racing aside from just unlocking new trucks.  I also can't fathom why this isn't a 4 player game--that would have been a great feature rather than just leaving it a 2 person vs game.

I have to admit, it gets annoying and frustrating to sit around watching cinematic scenes and listening to codec conversations instead of playing.  The other thing that I hated about this game is that you do get only a short chance to play with Snake, the main character of the original Metal Gear.  You spend most of the time controlling the whining Raiden, who I couldn't stand.  Why couldn't we play the whole game with Snake???  The storyline didn't quite cut it either.  I don't know if it was ruined by translation or what, but it lost me towards the ending with all its preachiness and philosophical talk, and I'm a lit major.
The reason I gave this four stars was because when you're actually playing the game, it's great.  This is the first Metal Gear I've played since the original for the Nintendo NES, and I was amazed by the graphics and gameplay.  I loved sneaking up behind guards and taking them out with a quick choke or a tranquilizer, and it was amazing to watch the character hang over railings and work their way across ledges.  Maybe I liked this so much because I never played the Metal Gear Solid for PS1, but I enjoyed the actual playing time immensely.","Great stuff, when you actually get a chance to play.",1010361600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

WIth a game like Heavy Rain, you can't excuse a mediocre plot like you could with a more action oriented title; the story is really essential. This isn't to say that the experience isn't effectively dramatic. The mood is encompassing, and you certainly feel drawn into the world.

The problem really comes down to the assembly of the story, and I'll offer up my complaints as best I can without giving away spoilers. Sure, it's a huge feat to have a branching, ""living"" story like this, wherein your actions determine the outcome of events. Nonetheless, the biggest complaints involve inexcusable plot holes. There's red herrings that simple get abandoned rather than explained away, and there's a handful of revelations that are frankly cheap and nonsensical.

It really is a shame, because despite this huge irritation, I still loved the game. I would still highly recommend it to a stranger on the street, but if you're even mildly paying attention, the actual plot will fail you. This had the potential to be something classic; something we could call the first ""The Silence of the Lambs"" in gaming. The sloppy and occasionally stupid writing will prevent it from ever achieving that accolade though. Never the less, it's incredible, beautiful, unique, and probably unlike anything you've ever played before. This game will be remembered as a pioneering and bold new step in video games, but I can only anticipate that the games it will influence will pull off the narrative construction far better, and it will be hard to look back and excuse this game by comparison. In some ways it's a revelation, but I can't say it's a classic.","engrossing and groundbreaking, but seriously flawed storytelling",1279324800,,,

 The one major thing that I did not like was the fact that the vigilante,firetruck and paramedic vehicle missons were changed from the ones in GTA3,and for the worse I might add. Instead of taking out 20 criminals(10 at one time and maybe 10 at another) and then getting rewarded;GTA Vice City will only reward you with something ONLY if you can get to and complete level 12. That means you have to CONSECUTIVELY take out 50 criminals/put out 50 fires etc etc. This can be ridiculously hard,and pretty much makes the gamer not even want to bother trying. I feel that the vehicle missons should have been left the same way as it was in GTA3. You will also no longer be rewarded with police bribes.....BIG MISTAKE!
 The second minor thing was the radio station selection. I understand that the game takes place in the 80's and as such only 80's music is available,but this can get kinda old. There is no real hardcore music. With the rock station count on early slayer,and with the rap station expect run dmc. Also, TWO michale jackson songs in the game were two too many! Let's face it when you have a wanted level of 3 or 4 and you're trying to speed away from the police,you need something more to listen to then 99

4.0,False,"10 30, 2007",A1ARIIDS0IPYLC,B000ELW4D6,Jeremy Deats,"So Factions was the second in the Guild Wars series of games. It's story line and environment bear no connection with the first Guild Wars (aka Guild Wars: Prophecies) save the fact that a player who owns both games may ""bridge"" a character from Factions over to the original campaign at about the 1/2 mark (the location called Lions Arch in Prophecies) and the reverse is also true, you are able to bring Prophecies characters over to factions. All the Guild Wars games are linked together in this way to add value and perks for players willing to invest in the entire series and in this case those perks are very good, but more on that in a bit.

So with Factions we have an Asian themed world that resembles ancient China. Although personal taste varies, many find factions to be the most beautiful of the Guild Wars series. The environments are vast, colorful and inspiring. Here we have all the original GW character classes plus two new classes. Assassin and Ritualism, both play very differently than previous classes.

Regarding the game experience: Factions moves along faster than the first guild wars, there is no ""pre-searing"" tutorial that last for days in this game. Instead you'll start on a small island that will quickly challenge solo players to seek assistance. You will level up quickly and you'll find yourself around 16-17 before leaving the ""beginners"" island. Once you arrive on the mainland you'll find yourself with level 20 henchmen with plenty of 3000 xp quest to get them to level 20 (for those that don't know, level 20 is the highest level a character can ascend to in GW. Playing through the first guild wars game, most players will not reach level 20 until 3/4's of the way through the game.

While the idea of getting to level 20 quickly sounds appealing it should be noted that it doesn't come easy, you will likely need help to get through these missions and if you want to play the game through it's required to get to level 20 quickly to move on. It's just a very different approach to play that ArenaNet has taken with this game. I believe of the three games available, Factions is the most difficult.

Should I buy Factions or Nightfall next?

This is the big question a lot of GW players face. My advice is to pick both of them up and to do so before you finish Prophecies. If you can only afford one of the two I would say get Nightfall, because you can bring your can bring you characters over and get Heros (they replace henchmen, you get to keep them), which provide an entirely new play dynamic to the game and will help you out greatly when other human players aren't available. Also Nightfall has better elite skills.

The main benefit of Factions is the fast leveling, but again you'll have to work for it.

Now Bloodrayne 2 is definitely better than the first, but it didn't have that special something as the first game did.

This game starts out slow and boring. Raynes moves are severely limited at the games start. But you slowly begin to gain new abilities and the game becomes a whole lot more fun.

The special abilities and fatalities are just so over the top its great. Over the top fun like a Kill Bill sort of way.

But there are some things i wasn't too pleased about. The first games low point were its 'jumping puzzles' and this games weak point was the same. Rayne many vertical and horizontal pole jumps were annoying and repititive. It sucks to climb 500 feet in a tower than miss one jump and have to climb all the way up again. 3D platforming is made fun in some games but Bloodrayne isn't one of them.

And whats the deal with the Blood Guns? Sure there are rocket launchers and shotguns, etc, but why do they have to run on 'blood?' Uzis, shotguns, and rpgs are more fun than Blood Stream, Blood Spray, and Blood Bomb. Lame.

Still, the game is a joy to play and the killing puzzles were handled awesome. Like throwing a baddie into a newspaper print machine, thus making it print red soaked newspapers, and having it blow up.

4.0,False,"03 20, 2017",ANNA1C2AYRVSA,B00ZJEIS2Y,Matthew Valdez,"Wildlands is a fun, addicting, action game that brings the series to a post Division Ubisoft. To not draw comparisons between this and The Division would be insane. Where Wildlands drops the MMO perspective of The Division, it gains a more fleshed out environment and story.

===Story===

Thrusting the Ghosts in a fictional Bolivia, while simultaneously looking and feeling realistic is the name of the game. You are the Ghosts, an elite group of soldiers that do not exist. Tackling Missions with up to 3 other friends or 3 Allies and trying to rid the country of a terrible person. While the story SOUNDS lackluster, I have been enjoying the banter between characters and the story. I have been more interested in the story than past open world military games.

===Game play===

Gun play, is where it feels most like The Division. Running between cover and precise Third person (or first person) controls feel great. Guns feel different, and being able to find new ones in the world is great. The game feels responsive and you can't blame shoddy controls for your deaths. Driving feels, a little less precise, but fun. I'll take that compromise and being able to plow down mountains is always fun! Helicopters are something that you definitely need to get used to though, it's no GTA.

Now I will say this, I can't play this game without a buddy. I do not want to deal with the AI and something about having a human on the other side of the game makes it a lot more fun. This is the same problem with The Division that plagues this. This game shines Co-op, if you play it Solo I wouldn't bother.

===Graphics and Audio===

The game both SOUNDS and LOOKS quite spectacular. Guns sound weighty and the landscapes in Wildlands are phenomenal. I have caught myself plenty of times just staring off into the mountains or flying a helicopter around.

===Summary===

If you have friends to play it with, this is a must-buy game. It is a great game, but it is meant to play with a buddy.",One of the best co-op adventures,1489968000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

The anticipation of what's going to happen keeps you playing. I kept waiting for it to flash forward to modern times and for the assassin's skill to be unleashed there. I won't ruin the game for you but I was a bit disappointed at the ending.

This is one of the few modern games I've played to the end, with most being shelved after a few weeks. This one kept coming out of the rack of games until I was finished. So, I'd say it's well worth the $[...] bucks compared to what most games are going for, and their ""value.""

If you buy one game for your system when you get it this one shows off what the PS3 can do quite well. You don't HAVE to play this one before the second one, but it's a good primer -- plus a lot cheaper in case you decide AC is not for you.

GAMEPLAY
There was a lot of potential in this game and it's really fun, but I can't give it 5 stars: It's too repetitive. Basically you climb buildings, go do mini-quests that repeat getting a bit tougher each time and then kill ""Bosses"" and run for your life (or do what I did:).

I'm not a hardcore gamer. So, after the first two levels, I realized a stealthy Assassin I was not. It simply required too much skill for me to lose the soldiers chasing you and hide and the stealthy way in was too tough for me, so I resorted to simply killing all the guards -- I got great practice saving citizens from street thugs. And once I learned to counter blows I was pretty much unstoppable. Maybe hardcore gamers would consider the fights too easy, but they're challenging enough that I lost a few even after I got used to the controls. But that's what was so fun about it - you could lose but it was less frustrating when you did.

I know they probably didn't intend me to walk into a building of 20 guards and have only me come out, but whatever (""I'll do what I want""). Even though they penalize you for killing innocents, I basically killed anyone who got in my way -- innocent or not. There's these crazy or drunk guys that push you when you'd be trying to get close to a target in some areas. A hidden blade works wonders on them so long as you don't worry about guards noticing, and making it too hard to kill your target.

OVERALL
The beautiful art and ability to do whatever you want kept me playing. I do have a problem with the fact that you can't kill some targets once they make it further away from where you're supposed to kill them. One or two guys made it out of the zone they set up, and I had to restart that part o the mission. I'm a huge fan of free running games so long as I like the topic/setting. And being an Assassin in the holy land during the Crusades is a great setting. Also, the game saves at every significant point so you don't have to redo a bunch of things you've already done if you die halfway through, which is a great mechanic.",A Modern Classic? No. Good Fun?

Brain needs to readjust its timing as to what's trips, quarters and half, and drummers need to pay more attention to the rhythm and less to when the note passes the mark.

The improv sections are neat and help weaker players get through songs they otherwise couldn't.  The new guitars have the most responsive strum bar I've seen to date on the rock band model.  Expert level players will appreciate this.

At first, I was impressed with the set list: Hail to the King, Somebody Told Me, Spiders......but asides from What's Up?, don't expect many decent songs past from what's written on the box.  I can appreciate a country song or two even though I loathe country just to let the series cover all the bases so I'm not even referencing that sort of stuff.  There just aren't many ""First Sting"" songs from artists.

I'm not sure if I experienced a game glitch or if the game is giving people preview songs.  My two favorite songs of the entire Setlist ended NOT being on the Setlist when I went to go find them again: Working Man by Rush and Jane by Jefferson Airplane.  These songs predate me by quite a bit so I'm not just some ranting geezer.  I went to play the songs after playing them my first night and they were gone.  So watch out.....you might get dooped like myself when you say ""this Setlist is pretty good"" just to see the examples you were leaning on disappear.

I assume some features are coming down the pike as Rockband was trying to beat Guitar Hero off the finish line.  The game seems a little barren with some features (not seeing any keyboard support) but this is a bit of a ""wait and see"".

Anyway, we've probably got half a dozen characters or more that we prefer to Slam Bam, but this guy has so far been the best for us in completing the Heroic Challenges.

The problem with many of the Skylanders is, by the time you may get around to working on the Challenges, you've probably maxed out your characters.  And if those upgrades do a lot of indiscriminate damage, it makes some of the Challenges where you can't break a vase or defeat a Purple Chompy pretty darn difficult.

But with Slam Bam, we've been able to complete all the Challenges currently available to us (22 right now...we're missing a few characters).  He's tough enough that you can just ignore a lot of the enemies trying to kill you and work on the Challenges where Speed is your Reward first.  For the ""island hopping"" challenges, being able to cross water is great (just don't rely on that too much since a lot of the islands don't have any shores that you can just get to them right out of the water) and if you chose the ice prison upgrade path, you don't need to worry about lobbing the bombs to defeat the enemies on platforms or higher ground.

And don't discount the falling anvils out of hand.  They don't do as much damage in the levels as when you use the Adventure Pack buildings themselves, but they do enough to give you an edge when you're surrounded by enemies.

As for not being able to find them anywhere...like other reviewers and commenters, we got ours at a Target.  Saw a box with ""Skylanders"" on the side, found a sales associate to come and open the box for us and inside were two each of this one, Pirate Seas and Darklight Crypt.  We were looking for other figures and it was pure, dumb luck that we found these, but they can be found out there.  I don't think it makes sense for Activision to not make anymore since they're still in demand, so while it may be hard to hear, but have patience.","Not my favorite Skylander, but kicks booty in Heroic Challenges",1329868800,,{'Edition:': ' Empire of Ice'},

It also works as a normal headset for listening to music, but at this price, there are much better sounding headphones if you don't want the gaming ability. The bass is rich and the highs are sharps, but it is not top tier.

Include in the in game controls and mic, this gaming headset is well worth the price. It's in the middle range, in terms of price, but it feels very durable and it performs its job perfectly.

Some gripes is that the microphone is hard to remove once it's in, so don't expect to repeatedly take it on and off, or I'm afraid that it might break, because it fits in there really snug. The microphone can't really be adjusted, like rotated at the base, but you can bring it closer or farther because it is the rigid, but bendy type.

The headset cable is on the short side, it's slightly shorter than the average length of normal headsers and I wish that it was longer. It's perfect length for attaching it to the controller but for other listening purposes, it is a bit on the short side.

They are quite light, especially in comparison to normal nongaming headsets, but you can feel that you are wearing them. I wear glasses and I had no trouble with these interrfing with my glasses. They are comfortable around the ears, and they don't make my ears feel suffocated. They are not sound proof, but with the sound or music on, it blocks out ambient sounds, but you can still hear if someone is talking to you really loudly. Wearing it on just one ear is comfortable too.

Do note that the microphone does not work if the headset is plugged into an iphone. I haven't checked its comparabilities with non xbox devices, but the mic does not work on the iphone 5s with ios7.

There are still people active in the Ghost Recon community who still create mods and maps for the game which are great fun and believe it or not has kept the game alive.

-It's wired, yo! I understand that wired controllers have lower latency and all that, but it doesn't reach back to the couch where I normally sit and there's a cord for someone to trip over.

Pros:
-the back wheels are pretty cool. It's really easy to program both of the wheels for three actions: roll left, roll right, and press in. They're not quite as useful as buttons, but they're really useful. I always thought that back triggers like the Elite controller were just weird. Now that I've used these wheels, I really want to try the elite controller... These back wheels are why this gets 4 stars instead of 3!
-the feel of the whole controller is pretty nice. It doesn't feel 3rd party cheap.

I currently have 2 which were purchased almost a year apart so I doubt it is an isolated issue. Aside from that, the only other issue I have is that the handle is SO big.

4.0,True,"06 26, 2013",ANUXCX8I7HYN7,B0085L2T0A,Evildead11,"It may have taken many WWE releases to finally get it right, but they did, in fact, get it right with WWE '13.  The controls are pretty much the same from WWE '12, which is a good thing.  It's very easy to learn and start competing without getting pummeled because you can't remember the three or four button combo needed to perform a suplex or a body slam.

The game has various modes including the normal WWE RAW/Smackdown ""season"" and the newly added ""WWE Attitude Era"" mode.  The Attitude mode basically takes you through history starting back with the formation of Degeneration X and the progression to present day WWE.  Now, this is a very cool idea and opens up the opportunity to play as very cool wrestlers such as Mankind, The New Age Outlaws, Stone Cold, etc.  The one issue I have with the Attitude mode is that, if you want to unlock certain bonuses such as new wrestlers, you must not only win the matches set for you, but you must perform certain actions during the match.  For example, you are Shawn Michaels wrestling the Undertaker.  You must win by pinfall...AND you must perform Sweet Chin Music twice, hit the Undertaker with a chair, successfully land an elbow drop from the top rope to the OUTSIDE of the ring and perform at least 3 taunts.  I mean, seriously?  Isn't it enough to just win the match?  Nope.  Some of the matches aren't that demanding in terms of the ""extras"" that you must perform, but it's annoying nonetheless.

And while I'm on the subject of unlocking bonus material, that's another negative aspect of this game in my opinion.  You do start with a decent stable of wrestlers, but there are SO many more available and you must unlock them all by performing various feats in the game.  I guess I'm just an old fashioned MK type of guy who wants the instant gratification of having all available fighters at my disposal.  If your favorite wrestler is Bret Hart, then you want to play as Bret Hart.  Not win the Diva's championship in a lumberjack match to unlock him.  I suppose some gamers consider this a reason to put long hours into the game and look at it as a plus.  I'm just not one of those guys who plays games over and over again to win all of the trophies, so to me, it's an annoyance.

Another thing I'd like to see is a living roster option similar to sports games such as NBA 2K13 or MLB The Show.  WWE constantly shuffles its active roster and introduces new characters.  After 3 or 4 months, the WWE '13 roster was out of date.  There is downloadable content available for SOME new wrestlers (Ryback, for example), but the DLC is fairly limited and the updates were eventually halted.  I suppose this is a tactic that Madden fans know well.  Force you to buy next year's edition if you want the new players.  Oh well.

Overall, this is a very fun game for casual and especially hardcore WWE fans.  It has the content, the controls, the graphics, the music, the customization and everything else a wrestling fan could ask for.  I can't think of a better wrestling game I've played.

Many things will be familiar to veteran players, like equipment having weight where you're constantly trying to balance using the very best weapons and armor, making you bulky and slow, versus being more agile, letting you move and roll quicker. Or that when you die you leave behind your experience points at the exact spot you died, and if you die again trying to recover them, they're gone for good. Even combat will feel similar, with regular and charged attacks, backstab, block and parry, and so on. LotF stands out though with some interesting changes. You get an xp multiplier that increases as you kill more enemies, but resets when you visit a save location. This incentivizes you to risk going longer and further without saving or refilling potions. When you do die the xp that you leave behind also has a time limit on it, shown as a percentage meter that slowly decreases. Combat eventually develops its own distinct flow, and I like how you can earn special items by defeating a boss in a specific way (not getting hit, using a lightning weapon, avoiding a certain attack, etc.). LotF also has an inspired look, reminding me a lot of the first Darksiders. I enjoyed my time with it. What I didn't enjoy as much is how maze-like some of the areas are (the Catacombs, Chamber of Lies), which are always frustrating to navigate, that once youve beaten NG++ you basically have to create a whole new character, that the world overall is a bit small, and that there are some annoying technical issues (screen-tearing, crashing). There's an allure present in the ""Souls"" games that's missing here. This is a good first game by an unfamiliar developer who I hope gets to make a sequel that capitalizes on its mistakes.

This is a more realistic game of tennis than that of Wii Sports and Sega Superstars Tennis.  This game utilizes the Wii Remote to `swing', and the Nunchuck to position your player, aim the ball, and get ready to serve.  I found the game was more fun after going through the 2 pages of tutorials.  This is not necessarily a game that you can play right out of the box, unlike Wii Sports.  Unlike other games before it, it utilizes different physics from one court to the next and the players have different strengths.  Not one player is maxed out in statistics, like in games like Tiger Woods (although, in his case, it probably is more like reality but back to Tennis).

Graphics is mediocre but there is no screen flicker or slowdown.  There are replays and `screen action modes' to get a zoomed up view of your player; however, it does get old so clicking `B' gets you right back into the action.  You can also perform gestures to show your happiness or frustration with your player.  Music is actually good, and not repetitive.

Setup of your Wii remote involves holding it on its side, which is unconventional from the standard way to hold the remote, so it is awkward to start.  You can opt for Normal Serve or Easy Serve/Special shot with the Nunchuck.  What makes this game more realistic is the ability to aim your shot, make your player run to the baseline or net, hit Top Spins or Slice Shots.  You can also perform Drop shots and lob shots.

I find Singles play to be easy for me.  Conceptually, I cannot get into the rhythm of Doubles play, so I will pass.

Menu navigation is easy.  There are three modes: Party, Exhibition and Road to Glory. Road to Glory involves progressing in your seeding through various events.  Party involves winning by capitalizing on various aspects of a match.

Pros:
- You can unlock different characters and build up their attributes and club/ball selection. This is a good feature that I haven't seen on any other golf games.
- Your players composure affects how forgiving the games controls are, if you shank one then your composure drops, a good shot will bring your composure slightly back up.
- Did I mention the golf engine is incredible?  Well, it is.  Graphically, this game is top notch and the Xbox has the hardware to support it with only the occasional, baaaaaarely noticeable drop in frame rate.
Cons:
-  The jokes just aren't as funny as they try to be, and it gets a little old after a while
-  The composure settings aren't all that accurate.  Example, any time you end up in the rough, your composure drops.  Well, most golfers I know aren't going to be too bummed if they are in the rough 12 yds from the hole after their 2nd shot on a par 5.  This can be pretty annoying sometimes.
-  There needs to be more than 3 courses.
-  My biggest gripe by far, the game is too easy.  While I struggle to break par on games like Links and Tiger Woods golf, I can consistently shoot 10-15 under par on this game.  Golf is supposed to be a CHALLENGE!

It didn't hurt that we both enjoy competing against each other every night at 7:30 while watching the actual show.  Not knowing how well this game was going to work on the Wii, I pulled out all stops and ordered the WiiSpeak as well (which seemed to be the only logical way to create a more authentic Jeopardy! experience).  While I think the game is definitely fun and a worthy purchase, there are a few frustrations that shouldn't come as surprising.

First, the positives:
- the game offers a realistic Jeopardy! experience visually ... everything on the show is represented in this game (from the occasional quirky categories to the sage-like mannerisms of the Alex Trebek Mii character.

- you can customize your Mii with items you earn by winning and with the WiiSpeak, you can even record ""happy"" and ""sad"" exclamations when you answer a question right or wrong (however the repetitive nature of the exclamation can be irrititating).

- the categories are varied and deep.  Like the real Jeopoardy!, you can end up with a whole board of categories you have no clue about ... chalk one up for the educational quality of video games.

- the game allows you to modify the difficulty level, response method and time allowed to respond.

- The mini-games between Jeopardy! rounds are fun and allow you to win items to customize the game.

- The optional WiiSpeak is not a requirement to play this game.

Now, the drawbacks (which are mostly associated with the Wii itself):
- Although the WiiSpeak is optional, it is preferable for realism.  The problem I experienced is that it only seems to work if: the settings on the WiiSpeak are perfect, you speak in a clear, concise and loud manner and there is not a single sound being made outside you answering the question.  In other words, if you have a dog, kids or the dishwasher going or if everyone is laughing and enjoying themselves ... forget it.  The sensitivity adjustments for the WiiSpeak are not always helpful either.

- Being able to type responses requires a keyboard in my opinion and using a Wii controller to spell words was frustrating for me personally (thankfully spelling the first few letters will generate a list of answers to choose from as a shortcut).  The game does offer a multiple choice option for answers that eliminates the need to spell the answer, but I didn't like seeing all the answers.  I don't fault the game for this as it generously gives the player three answering methods to choose from before the game begins.

- I am not aware of the opportunity to expand the database of answers in the future.

Overall, I think this is a great rendition of the real thing ... fun and challenging.  I'm not a fan of spelling with a controller, but the more I play, the more I see improvement in my ""console controller dexterity"".

An interesting twist on the more traditional JRPG genre, the Atelier games are about being an alchemist, brewing concoctions, and generally saving the world/solving some big problems/learning alchemy/maintaining an atelier. After a length weight, Atelier Sophie: Alchemist of the Mysterious Book is finally here and is Gusts' first Atelier title built for the PlayStation 4. Does the Atelier series transition well to a next-gen console? Pretty darned well.

First off, I love the Atelier games. They are great, seriously, we have covered a few. Each title is chalkfull of a cast of lovable characters that each have their own struggles that tug at your heartstrings (nnnngggghhhh ... Ateleir Ayesha ...). Atelier Sophie is no different, though at times feels more lightweight than previous titles, with the affable, if airheaded Sophie leading the troupe this time around. While Eschy and Logy, or even Ayesha all had wonderful supporting characters, I have a serious ""thing"" for Sophie's friend and supporter, Monika Ellmenreich. Voiced in English by the stunning and vibrant Erica Lindbeck and voiced in Japanese by the utterly gorgeous, incredibly talented, and simply wonderful Suzaki Aya. She is Sophie's more serious friend and supporter, and frankly, one of my favorites in the entire franchise.

Monika aside, Atelier Sophie is a proper entry into the Atelier franchise, though I do have a few little (and I mean LITTLE) issues with it. The first issue is how you ""glide"" across the ground; simply walking across the screen shows Sophie sliding before stepping; it is extremely distracting and shows that Gust may still be stuck in the portables mindset. I would be more forgiving if this was a Vita port to the PlayStation 4, where the Vita is nowhere near as strong as the PlayStation 4, but it is not. Atelier Sophie was built for next-gen systems and this sort of amateur animation is troublesome. On the topic of amateur animation, and the second issue I have with Atelier Sophie is the lip syncing. Whether you are playing the game in Japanese (as you should be) or you are playing in English, the lip syncing is atrocious. The quality of syncing is PlayStation One era at best, and is a massive letdown given the quality of everything else in Atelier Sophie.

Though the Atelier games have always looked good, I was absolutely stunned by the gorgeous character art and animation (syncing and footsteps aside). Within minutes of meeting Monika, Sophie's childhood friend, I was in love, and even twenty and thirty hours into the game I am still floored by amazing vistas, stunning character art, or the deep and wonderful story. Add to that mix the tried-and-true atelier item gathering/crafting mechanics and a solid combat mechanic, and well ... you have one of Gust's best to date.

If the PlayStation 4 will continue to get priority from Gust I would like to see more attention spent on careful animation and getting away from the amateur-level animations and syncing that I see in Sophie. However, their writing remains top notch, their choice of seiyu and English voice actors remains some of the best in the industry, and their addictive blend of resource gathering, crafting, and more traditional JRPG goodness is masterful when it is at it's worst.

Is there a certain rule that bargain games cannot be good?  Must a game cost fifty bucks for it to be good?  That's what all magazine reviews seem to be leaning towards.  Don't listen to them, it's just their opinion anyway.  They're a bunch of spoiled babies who sit there and get paid to write ridiculous reviews on games like DS.  I just got the game today, wanted to check out what it was like and surprisingly I found myself playing it for 2 hours.  Bottom line is that if you like Diablo, you will probably like this game.

Control: 8 Can you rotate the camera view at any time in Vagrant Story?  I think not.  Button-smashing (as some of the reviews claim)? Not at all.  Movement could feel more realistic, but we're not here to complain.
Fun Factor: 10 After spending 2 hours with the game, it's about as much fun as Diablo was when I opened up the game and popped it in for the first time.  How much longer will this last?  Who knows.

It's still the same old formula, you move your 'cannon' along the bottom of the screen and shoot moving 'invaders' as they inch closer and closer towards earth.  This time though, there are a lot of variations in the mix.  The invaders themselves come in several different sizes, extra small, small, regular, large and extra large.  They are set up in various formations and have different flight patterns and attacks as well.  Some invaders have shields, some have reflective shields that bounce your shots back at you, some even turn sideways and being two dimensional, they nearly disappear! There are also new type of UFOs, each with different colors and attacks.

Scoring is based on several factors.  You can set up scoring combos with a 3 second timer.  As long as you keep killing, the combo chain remains.  You are also awarded bonus points for level-specific attacks, like shooting out each column or row at a time, killing all the same color or shape opponent in row, etc.  Also, if you kill four of the same color enemies in a row, a timed weapon upgrade appears... this can be a laser, bomb, or spread shot.  Complete the level-specific attacks to deploy a flashing UFO. Shoot him down and a minigame starts, maybe kill X amount of invaders in a certain timeframe, or kill just one well protected invader, etc.

Boss battles signal the end of a level.  They are often very large invaders and have different critical kill spots.

One great addition to the classic gameplay is the ability to save and start at the beginning of the level when you load or continue a game.  No more starting from scratch every time.  Your score will also start at whatever it was at the beginning of the level, so you can rebuild on that.

A multiplayer mode is included via Ad-Hoc as well.

At $19.99, this title is a steal for fans of retro gaming, causal gamers (you only use one button after all), or hardcore gamers looking for a challenge as the levels become faster and the enemies come in thick waves.

My only knock is that some of the backgrounds are a bit 'Windows 95-y'... just boring, ugly text floating around.  But you're usually too focused n the gameplay to notice.

You take the role as an American soldier fighting in the horrid conditions of the Pacific Islands as well as a Russian right in the middle of the war in Europe. It's a stylized version based loosely in real battles; this is not for history buffs, but only those looking to do some combat to conquer the Third Reich. When you get through the campaign, the absolutely brilliant and addicting bonus mode Nazi Zombies is unlocked as well, a multiplayer challenge that's unwinnable but ingenious enough to be enjoyable every time.

4.0,True,"06 1, 2011",A328GJTBFRUHL7,B0017WHQ34,Kindle Customer,"*Introduction*
The 3d platformer is a dying genre. Once one of the more popular styles of games back in the N64/Playstation era it seems like the only notable titles in the current era are the Super Mario Galaxy games. There have been a few sleeper hits like Psychonauts, but they have been few and far between. Now we have Mushroom Men, a quirky new platformer that is reminiscent in many ways of the old N64 style platformer with a few twists of its own.

*Story*
The premise of this game involves a shower of green glowing meteors that bombard the Earth and turn the plants and fungi of the world into sentient beings that form their own societies. You play as Pax, a Bolete mushroom with telekinetic powers, whose village was destroyed by the poisonous mushrooms. Without his home, he becomes a wanderer and stumbles across a village of peaceful mushrooms in the middle of a festival. After taking part in the festivities, he is given the honor of holding the villages prized meteorite. Unfortunately, once it is given to Pax, he somehow absorbs it, so he sets off on a quest to replace the villages meteorite, although he has a bit of trouble doing this, since he also absorbs all of the other meteorite fragments that he comes across. Along the way he runs into a tribe of evil poisonous mushrooms, who are also on a quest to collect meteor fragments, while they battle with the peaceful tribes.

The story isn't fleshed out a whole lot, but it's better than standard fare for the platforming genre and sets the stage well enough.

*Gameplay*
The gameplay is fairly standard 3d platforming. You jump around levels searching for collectibles and battling enemies. Pax's abilities include jumping, gliding, and psychic powers. He also eventually gets a sticky hand which he can use as a grapple to get to certain objects that are really high or far away. His telekinetic powers are controlled by the Wii remote pointer and allow him to manipulate levers and other objects around him, to progress through levels and fight off foes. There are objects to collect scattered throughout the levels such as the meteorites which grant him more hit points once he has enough of them, parts to put together into weapons, and well hidden pieces of junk that unlock concept art. If you don't like the collectathon style of platformer, you can put your fears to rest, as the majority of the collecting is entirely optional. If you do like collecting, then you will also be happy as there are 81 meteorites to collect and a lot of weapon parts. The best part is that all of the collectibles are actually useful to collect. They aren't random baubles that you need X amount of to open some door, like other platformers.

The level design ranges from somewhat linear like Super Mario Galaxy, to open and explorable closer to the Banjo-Kazooie games with other levels falling somewhere in between. They are all fairly well designed, with a few small issues like sticky hand objects not being immediately obvious. The most explorable worlds are the most fun, but the linear levels are pretty good as well. There are some options presented in a few of the tasks. For instance, you can either fight a tough enemy head on, or you can explore the level and use the objects around it to take them out. The only problem with the level design is that if you are playing to find everything, in a couple of levels areas get blocked off from you as you progress, and in others you'll end the level if you complete a certain task. However, this isn't a big problem as you can replay levels any time you want.

Weapon creation is really clever. As you find ordinary objects like paperclips, bottle caps, and tooth picks, Pax will assemble them in various ways to create different kinds of weapons. This is a fairly automatic aspect, though. I would have liked to have a more active hand in figuring out how to put the things together. There are 4 weapon types of Bashing, Slashing, Thrusting, and Radical. The weapons of the first three categories are the main weapons you will use, while the Radical weapons are unique and require ammo. There is no reason to use anything but the most powerful weapon of each type, and the unique radical weapons slow down Pax so much that they are a pain to use. I would have liked to see a bit more varied usage among the melee weapons.

The combat is the weakest part of the game. Your attacks are all controlled by shaking the Wii remote, but it's nothing more than standard attacks that could have been controlled by a button. You can also attack using your telekinetic powers to grab various objects with the Wii pointer and then shake it to throw them at the enemies. I found the all of the Wii remote actions to be a little unresponsive and annoying to use. Thankfully, the combat in this game is easy enough that it doesn't matter too much.

Dying in this game is not a problem. It works in such a way that when you die you will merely be sent back a little bit in the level and all your progress remains. This helps keep the game fun without ever feeling too frustrating. There are rewards for beating the bosses without dying, though.

*Replay Value*
The game length is around 8 to 10 hours if you want to collect everything, and about 6 hours if you just rush through the story. At the main menu for the game, you have the option of replaying every level to collect things you missed or just replay them for the story. Overall, there is not a whole lot of replay value, but that's fairly standard for this type of game.

*Visuals*
The game looks really good for a Wii game. The style is darkly quirky and sort of reminiscent of the visual style Psychonauts. The worlds are all visually interesting, varied, and detailed having you explore areas like piles of junk, a back yard, an old shed, and a run down farm house. It's amazing to go through and see all the clever little details like the product parodies and the ways the mushrooms use human items for their architecture and technology. They really make you feel like a tiny mushroom exploring this huge human world full of vicious giant monsters like rabbits and chihuahuas.

*Sound*
The music in this game is as quirky as everything else. It contains lots of unusual unconventional sounds and really adds to the atmosphere perfectly. The levels almost seem to pulse and move to the beat at some points. There aren't a whole lot of memorable melodic tunes, but it works perfectly in this game.

*Summation*
This game was quite a pleasant surprise for me. It is an overlooked Wii gem that anyone who enjoys 3d platformers at all will have a great time with. It's well worth the low price it's going for, so if you like quirky 3d platformers go out and buy it.",A Fun and Quirky Platformer,1306886400,4,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

The controls and camera angles are what you'd expect from a Silent Hill game and if you've never played one before I'd suggest starting with 2 or 3 ( or the original I guess, if you've got a PS1 lying around.)  The graphics are pretty bad most of the time.  The video scenes in the very begining and end of the game show how good they could be, but the developers either couldn't fit that good of graphics throught all the scenes or were just lazy.

The music is as good as always and Akira Yamaoka is truly a master at capturing the essence of Silent Hill in his music.

I found the story to be pretty linear considering how good SH2's story was, and the game was short.  The Butcher came off as a cheap immitation of Pyramid Head of SH2.  He was more violent than scary and was only given two instances of screen time.  He doesn't come off as a big deal in the grander scheme of things.  And although Origins had a few fairly memorable scenes, they seemed to not linger around long enough to make an impact.

But it seems like I'm complaining a lot which is weird because I really DID enjoy the game.  I would say number 2 and 3 are better, but this one isn't bad.  It held true to the Silent Hill formula while still adding a few elements (portals to the Otherworld; breakable weapons) and I liked the changes in the firearms used.

The rifle shoots much more quickly than in SH2 and Travis can move while firing (helpful!) and the shotgun is a double-barrel rather than a pump-action, so you can fire twice in quick succession and reload in the menu.  However the ""Service Pistol"", an M1911 automatic, was incorrectly put with 9mm ammunition when it should have been a .45 caliber.  Normally I wouldn't care, but in all other rights the firearm accuracy was solid.  If anyone knows who the woman on the grip of the Redeemer is, put up a comment.

But yes, let's get back to the light level.  It's low.  The game is dark, and very much so.  I often would tap the X button just to find objects I couldn't see.  I can't tell you how often I picked up weapons lying on the ground or against a wall that I didn't even know were there.  I know it's Silent Hill and they've always been dark, but jeez!  And the grainy textures from the blown up PSP version didn't help.

But the story brough back the history of Alessa with Travis facing his inner demons in some memorable settings and managed it successfully, so is there even room to complain?  It's not as good as 2 or 3 but those were fantastic games, so this one is at least good.  And there are plenty (PLENTY) of games that can't say that.  It's a solid entry.  Silent Hill fans will love it, horror game fans would be best advised checking out one of the others.

(Note: I didn't mention Silent Hill, Silent Hill 4: The Room, or Silent Hill: Homecoming.  That's because I haven't yet played them.  I didn't mean to suggest they weren't as good as 2 or 3.  I really have no idea if they are or not.)","""Origins"" from the Latin ""dark""",1233014400,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

I'm enjoying the game so far but Hitman purists might be disappointed. I've played through Hitman 2, Contracts, and Blood Money and found all of them to be very enjoyable games so I thought Absolution would be a must buy.

 So far the game feels very different, as so far all of the levels have been continuous whereas the past Hitman games always had you jumping from location to location, assassinating different targets at a time. Since this game starts off with mostly 47 trying to escape from the police, most of the missions have been escaping missions with a couple of assassinations sprinkled in. I've played mostly the missions seen in early previews of the game so while those missions were fun, I already saw someone play through it so the mystery and fun of exploring a new level was muted a bit. The game has been good so far but I expect it to get better once the game starts feeling like the old Hitman games. If I do have a criticism it would be for the checkpoint system. Rather than the old saves you could do in Hitman games, you will now reach checkpoints which you have to activate. The idea sounds fine to me, but doesn't seem to be executed that great. If you take out some enemies before you reach a checkpoint, a lot of them ""respawn"" or ""awaken"" if you die or reload the checkpoint.

Besides the gameplay, everything looks and feels great so far. Graphics are very good and it's very impressive how they manage to pack so many characters on screen without any frame rate issues. So far most of the environments have been the same but they look great so I can't complain too much. Sound and voice acting is well done.

Since I'm in the early stages of the game, I understand why the story/missions have been pretty linear/continuous so far. I'd hope that they eventually start putting me in more diverse locations and situations so I feel that this has the potential to be a 5-star game.",Pretty good so far,1353456000,7,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

The levels, on a sidenote, are very linear, however very amazing.

Oh, and Xbox Live is incredible as well...when it works.  For some reason, it's very hard to connect to a server, because it says ""game no longer available"" for 9 of the 10 times i try to connect (this is on servers with player slots leftover).  However, once you get connected (it takes patience, but eventually it works) it's usually worth the pain.  There are several different modes of play that are all fun and easy to learn.

Whether it's because I wait until big price drops most of the time, or because super hyped up games makes me cautious, it takes a long time before I get to play most of them. Bioshock is one of those games, and after finally buying it recently, I have to say that I'm ashamed of myself for not playing it sooner. This is one of the few games that had my attention from the very beginning, and I didn't play any other game until I beat it. The last game that did that for me? Fallout 3. I -love- the city of Rapture and very much look forward to playing the sequel very soon. As much as I hate to sound like a fanboy who won't have anything negative to say about the game, I mean it when I say that this is one of those games that I didn't want to end. For the handful of people out there who still haven't played Bioshock, you need to at the very least borrow it from a friend.

Right from the start, you're thrown into the fire. You play as a man traveling over the ocean in a plane, when it suddenly goes down. As the only survivor, you make it through the fiery debris to a lighthouse that ends up being more than it seems. As it turns out, it leads to an underwater city- Rapture. This was once a perfect city, ruled by no one, where people could do as they pleased without worrying about big government coming in and ruining everything. At least, that's how it was at one point. Things are much different now. Mutated killers known as Splicers run amok, everyone's going nuts over a substance known as Adam that practically gives the user super powers, and little girls with syringes go around Rapture harvesting the Adam from anyone they encounter with the help/protection of the huge Big Daddy body guards. A man named Atlas contacts you via radio, giving you tips on how to stay alive down there, and he also needs your help to get back together with his family. You help him out, he'll help you out. It's a long journey, and you'll make use of guns, tools, special powers and computer hacking abilities in order to make it out.

Bioshock never drags on, moving along at a smooth pace. It plays like a standard First Person Shooter, but with some interesting tweaks. You shoot and change weapons with the R1 and R2 buttons, and use powers and change them with L1 and L2. You can only carry a few powers at first, but can get a few more slots as you progress, and you can always change what you have thanks to handy gene swapping vending machines conveniently scattered throughout Rapture. In addition to more powers, there are ability enhancements to be found. Extra power while swinging the wrench, having more time to hack gun turrets and security cameras, resisting damage better, emitting an electric shock when hit by an enemy...there's quite a bit you can have, with many fun combinations. The powers you use are also good for more than just casually hitting enemies. If someone's escaping from you and is running through a flooded area, zap the water with your lightning! Is the bad guy picking you off from a distance? Pick up a trash can with telekinesis to use it as a shield and make your way toward them. I was surprised at how smart the AI could be on the normal difficulty setting. There are lots of First Aid stations in Rapture for anyone to use for a small fee- even the enemies. The first time I learned this was when a Splicer ran away from me as I was reloading my machine gun. I chased after him and had the guy against a wall...but he was doing something to the First Aid station. Before I could figure out what was going on, I saw that his health bar had fully restored! How do you remedy this? Simply hack the First Aid station so it heals you but hurts anyone else who uses it. It was also surprising to see how well the enemies would make use of objects to take cover, or run off and hide for a few seconds before getting the drop on you, literally and figuratively. Early in the game, an enemy that can walk on the ceiling is introduced, and these guys always managed to get me, even towards the end of the game.

And do I even need to say anything about the Big Daddies? These are one of the best-designed characters in a game I've seen in years. Even towards the end when I had strong enough weapons to take them out in just a couple of hits, I'd get that ""oh no"" feeling when I'd hear one at a distance. Big Daddies can and will make a rag doll out of you if you're not fast enough or don't set up a trap. Fortunately, they only attack you if you make the first move, or if you pose a threat to the Little Sisters they usually accompany. Taking care of the Little Sisters is a big part of the game, where you either save them from the parasite within, or harvest the parasite and get lots of Adam to buy new powers and abilities. As ghastly as these little girls are, you can't help but feel sorry for them, both the condition they're in, and when you take down their Big Daddy and see them crying over the lifeless body.

I could keep going about the things I loved about the game: sitting back while well-acted audio diaries played out, the perfectly minimal score, fantastic art direction, etc., but I think everyone's heard enough of it over the last 5 years. Bioshock deserves the praise it got. My only complaint is that I wanted more, the semi-letdown of an ending, and it seemed like the character you play as could've been more fleshed out. In the opening cutscene, he's talking, but as soon as it's over, the guy never talks again apart from groans when he gets hurt. We learn A LOT about him as the story progresses, yet he still came off as 'generic mute hero' to me. To be honest, the hero was the one boring thing about the game, but it's not a big fault. The final boss battle is over before it gets interesting, and I'm hoping that when I go through Bioshock on the hardest difficulty soon, that it'll be better. Let's just say that the good AI seemed to have went to every bad guy -except- the final boss. And my little gripe is that the ending is over way too quickly. Final level finishes, you get a cutscene that can't be more than a minute long, and the credits roll immediately upon the cutscene finishing. No time to let it sink in- the credits start up the second it's done. At least it was a good ending for what it was.

Giving this game 4 stars instead of 5 feels wrong, but I truly feel that the last moments could've been stronger. The writers put a ton of time into the plot and making the characters seem real, and it shows that Bioshock is a labor of love. It's one of the best games I've played this generation, and I'll be going through Bioshock 2 very soon in order to be ready for Infinite.

Was Fun, given enough time it can be addictive
Took a lot of time to play and get the controls down for me.
I suppose researching the game is part of it as well if you want to speed up the game play some.
There is plenty of tips and cheats available online if that is your preference.
I believe the slow pace is an attempt in the design to be more realistic as well.
Space fights, capture ships and dominate space in various ways (Fighting, economy, other)

4.0,False,"01 27, 2004",A2I6E66AGN7AUH,B000099T2E,Nethalar,"I actually like RC1 more.  I have played and beaten Ratchet and Clank the first, and am about to beat number 2.  I do love this game, but I thinks it's important for me to point out it's flaws for Ratchet and Clank fans'
1.  Compared to RC1, I found this game to be significantly EASIER!  That's right, easier.  I read one post or two saying it's hard.  MOST of this game is easier than RC1, except obstacle courses (like gliders and levitators), hoverbike races, giant clank battles (one in particular), that sort of thing.  The levels I feel like were longer (I think so anyway', tough to tell), but just easier.
2. I think most of the increased ease is because of the plethora of weapons and upgrades.  Although the weapon acquiring and upgrades can be cool, I feel they took more center stage than necessary on this one.  I'd like to see a reduction here in the next installment.  Also, your armor can be upgraded to the point of ridiculous  indestructibility.  They SHOULD NOT ever go beyond this in a future addition.  In fact, they should find a way to scale it down a bit (which would also require some ' though not much ' scaling down of opponents' damage capabilities, possibly Ratchet's too.)
3. I also felt the puzzles were easier overall (a few exceptions).  The two intrusive devices, the Electrolyzer (a 2D grid with moving lights and 2 way switches ' it even sounds too easy when described), and the Infiltrator (a globe device where you have to guess the path of the traveling' gas it sounds like) were just not as difficult as the device in RC1 (forgot what that was called).  I felt the device from RC1 was a much cooler design, and it felt like the puzzle was making me think on different levels at once. (Three circle of lasers and reflectors that have to aligned to different targets' heck it even sounds hard).  Though even RC1 was guilty of allowing some of these puzzles to be too easy on later levels (Hint to Insomniac, make the puzzles later in the game HARDER).  That being said, I think the Infiltrator had potential if the puzzles were harder overall, but the Electrolyzer was hopeless.  Perhaps a new 'level' could somehow be added to the Infiltrator.
4. NOT ENOUGH CLANK MISSIONS!  I find myself missing the little guy in this one.  They have Clank missions, but they all seemed easier and shorter.  None of them are as long or cool as the one from Orxon on RC1.  In fact, I was disappointed that in RC1 once you played the Clank missions, the area was 'freed up' and couldn't access those areas anymore with Clank.  Unless you start and play a whole new game!  Hint Insomniac: make Clank missions replayable as a game, just like the arena and hoverbike race!  Also, make more little Clank missions next time, long and tough please!
5. More specifically on Weapons, the modifications you can get with the platinum bolts are cool, but I don't really like the electricity or gas mods that gave any modded weapon an area of effect quality.  Each mod should be just the cool strafing mods or something specific to the weapon.
6. Again on the weapons' I think it's the upgrades (using your weapon so much they get more power) that imbalanced the game.  After upgrading my weapons, everything became easy' even the Impossible Challenge in the Arena!  Or they needed a harder than impossible challenge for people who are fully upgraded.  Now there's nothing I can't beat easily.
7. Too many weapons that work for you!  In RC1, you only had the glove of doom, little robots that ran on the ground and self destructed.  There was also the Visibomb guided missile, which wasn't quite as cheap.  Using the Glove of Doom always made me feel cheap though.  In RC2, you have stationary turrets that you can place and they shoot for you, flying robots that follow you and shoot for you, a shield which gets upgraded to deal damage to anything that touches you, and a Sniper rifle for picking guys off from far away (it has an awesome zoom feature).  I feel that Insomniac should limit weapons that fight for you.  These just make it too easy.  The Sniper should probably be toned down just a little (it was mostly fine).
8. Lastly on weapons, the flamethrower (pyrocyter ' even the name is cool!) was very useful in RC1.  It was a great 'circle and fire weapon' useful for taking out little critters when they swarm you.  You can't really do that in RC2.  Yes, you do get a lava gun that functions the same basic way' but you don't find it until later in the game!  RC1 you get the pyrocyter on like the second world.  It takes significantly longer to get the lava gun.  Worse, once upgraded, the lava gun has more powerful shots, but no longer has the functionality of the lava gun/pyrocyter.  Terrible!  Instead of a constant stream, it fires volcano rocks or something' powerful but reduced and lame functionality, it became almost like the rocket launcher.  I felt cheated.  Constant stream circling is just fun and cool.  Bring it back Insomniac.
9. The grind rails were easier on this one.  They also seemed shorter.  The grind is definitely one of the most fun aspects of this line.  Make em better I say!
10. The hoverbike is cool and all, but I REALLY miss the hoverboard.  Bring it back, man!  Especially with the feature of the hoverbike races where THEY attack YOU.  Do this for the hoverboard, and it'll totally rock!  You could also have antigravity sections (kinda like the magnetic boot sections for Ratchet) for the board, or bike, or BOTH!
11. Ratchet's best possible battle armor is kinda lame' because you never really need it.  And worse it covers your whole Face!  I want to see ratchet!  They hid him!  Even if it were necessary, I would never purchase the armor just cause it hides his face!  LAME!
12. In general, I don't see the need for weapons and armor that are super high priced and you will NEVER need!  The Zodiac weapon and the best armor you don't need at all to win or beat any battle.  And they cost so much you need to spend ridiculous amounts of time collecting money.  Next time, every weapon and armor should be needed.  And they should cut down the cost so that you acquire them in half to 2/3's the amount of time.
13. The AI for monsters is still too dumb.  Slight improvement over the last one, that's it.  They need to make it even harder.
14. If it matters to you, the story is not as good as RC1.  RC1 had a simple but cool n effective storyline.  RC2 is more like Hollywood hack stuff.  Won't go into it in more detail (and better English!) because it's not really critical to this game.  They might try a plot where Ratchet and Clank are chased throughout, rather than planet hopping to chase some bad guy'
I thinks that's it for the negatives.  Things this thing is great at'
1. WHOA!  The replay value on this one is much higher, because of all the frigging games: hoverbike races, arena battles, the space ship battles, and Giant clank battles.  They really needed more of these, especially the giant clank missions.  They could totally expand on Giant Clank (see the mods note for the ship below).
2. Mods on the ship rule!  I love my tiger yellow spaceship (color is the last thing you should worry about though).  I was surprised that these mods were mostly balanced.  Perhaps the shields make it a little too easy, and the space mines, but only a little.  Oddly enough, the mini-nuclear missile I didn't find to be overly powerful at all, just right.  Keeping the same weapons here would be fine.  Wouldn't want to see a lot of expansion on these here, maybe some device to help track opponents better, or navigate/fly better.  Otherwise, they just need more space missions, Rah!
3. Beautiful, absolutely beautiful.  Probably even better looking in RC2 than in RC1.  Actually definitely better.  Each world is immersive and real.
4. Globe worlds rock.  Gimmee more!
5. The Tractor beam is a great gadget!  I love it.  Especially moving the robots around.  The water freezer/heater is cool too.  Maybe incorporate some spots in the game where you can swing in a circular pattern on the swingshot, and have it fling you further!  But it's more difficult to control and only useful when reaching large platforms!  Great mod for that one, and it wouldn't require much change!
6. A gadget that allows you to control robots and operate them.  Totally cool.  But I think they put more of these in there at the expense of little clank missions...boo
All in all, great.  I just like RC1 better on its first pass. (I will review it here later).  Again the replay for RC2 is pretty darn good.  They should 'ratchet' it up one level next time, to the true level of  'forever insomniac'  heheh.","greater replay than RC1, but I liked RC1 more...",1075161600,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I've been really happy with the way it helps her keep her DSlite in Nerf Armor in one place along with her charger, games, extra styluses etc... We've had no problem with getting games in or out of the storage spaces and the games seem to be held in tightly even after continuous use. I really wanted a case of my own, but was waiting until more colors were made available as I didn't want pink/white or black. Today I found a red/black case hiding among all the camo and skull patterns and I happily purchased it.

What makes it so good?
* New tribes to play. Or, perhaps more importantly, new tribes to play against. The Mayans can be a terror.
* New tribe attributes. Seafaring! Agricultural! OK, that doesn't sound that exciting, but it definitely has an impact on gameplay and strategy. Agricultural favors the AI such that the new Killer AI tribes are almost always those with the Ag trait, like the Celts.
* Boosted navy! Combined with the Seafaring, navy is still underpowered, but way better than before. On an archipelago map, seafaring can mean the difference between a breezy success and a slow slog.
* Boosted airforce! Bombardment in general is boosted, so everything from catapults to stealth bombers feels a little more useful.
* Fewer resources! Wait, fewer resources? Well, not fewer KINDS of resources. Just fewer all around. You either have to learn to play very nice with the AI or very mean.
* Entertaining scenarios! From the cradle of civilization to the 20th century, you can have your turn (sorta) re-enacting historical events. These can be fun, fast, intense, changes of pace from the epic game.
* New techs/wonders/governments! The unit-producing Statue of Zeus and Knights Templar are a hoot. The Temple of Artemis is amazingly powerful (but very short-lived). The Internet--well, like all the modern wonders, it seems a little too late. But it ain't bad. Fascism is a blast to play if you want to live out your Great Dictator fantasies, but you can see the AI self-destruct with it, too, unfortunately.
So, how was this Really Good Thing screwed up? Bugs! Bugs o' plenty! If you're a casual player, playing particularly on Chieftain or Warlord levels (maybe even Regent), you might not notice the bugs. Not at first, anyway. There are patches, oh, yes, there are patches, unofficial though they may be. But the situation seems to have arisen because the game was yanked out of public beta toward release-time, then tweaked and re-tested internally. Unfortunately, this game is too deep and often too subtle to be effectively tested by any in-house crew. Result? They managed to break trade, corruption and resource-distribution in the final release.
An official patch will eventually be released. Probably before the summer. Until then, you have the choice of living with bugs, or living with a beta patch (which might introduce its own bugs), or simply waiting to get the game.
There's an even more serious problem, really, underlying these changes. Trade is absolutely vital with the resource reduction. Either you find a way to trade, or you find a way to conquer, which may not be a play style you want to be forced into Every Single Game. The problem is, the trade and diplomacy systems are not sophisticated enough to meet this increased need. If you need iron, but it's all being traded, you can't offer the AI any incentive to trade it to you when the current deal is up. Those deals get made in-between turns, so you often don't have a shot.

Firstly, the game is beautiful. It truly is in every sense of the word. The music helps pull you into the game, the scenery is amazing, and once you've climbed a few of the towers you'll notice the city and general countryside is as well.

The thing is once you've climbed one tower you generally have a pretty decent idea of how beautiful it is and climbing nine others is pointless. However, climbing towers and assisting men and women being beaten up in the streets seems to be the majority of the game. There are also mini missions revolving around pick pocketing, listening in on conversations, and beating up people for information but they too get repetitive quickly.

Combat is enjoyable but once you get the hang of it really easy, especially with the parrying ability. I remember attacking a swarm (10 or so) guards all at once. I managed to easily kill all of them which seems a bit strange because despite how skilled a man is I don't think he could take a small platoon down himself. Especially if you consider the nature of this game it would make more sense if you were more skilled but if in situations such as that you wouldn't be so overpowered. Your role is to hide in the shadows not act as a hooded fashionably challenged Zoro.

In general it's a nice concept and interesting to play but it's nothing to get too excited about. The greatest part of this game has to be just playing through town with no set goal killing off someone and hiding. While it sounds like something an adolescent would enjoy it's fun to just see how people respond.

All that said, it was a fun game off and on. I enjoyed the beginning, got tired of it, continued playing, and got even more tired of it.

Here's my review on what is one of, if not the, biggest game and what some say the most overrated game, of all-time. I've only played it for about 6 hours, so I will probably be editing this review. This is my first impression. ( Note: I didn't play the beta. )

Graphics: 4.5/5 Look quite good, but don't really blow you away. The character models for the most part look phenomenal, and the environments do as well. Still, it's not the most impressive looking game out there right now. Hell, to all the whiners, I'd rather have an okay looking game that runs smoothly than a fantastic looking game that lags a lot.

Sound: 5/5 Top notch. The talking throughout your men in campaign is really well done. The voice acting in the cut scenes are also great. You will likely never hear the same thing twice in battle. The explosions and guns still sound fantastic too. Everything Halo 2 sounded like, but better.

Control: 4.5/5 Not quite perfect. In my opinion, Halo 2 had better controls for a 360 controller. Still, Halo 3 doesn't control bad, but it does take some getting used to. Such as you having to learn how to use the RB button to get in vehicles and pick up guns and what-not, as well as reload, instead of using the X button used in Halo 2. Still controls very well though.

Fun: 5/5 I must say, this game left a great first impression. I started with Campaign first, and was less than surprised at the start, mainly because the game kept on lagging. But once the game started going, the Campaign got pretty fun. And, in case you don't already know, you can have four person co-op, which makes Legendary quite a bit easier to play through. ( Still not a sinch in any stretch of the imagination though. ) I could review this game all day. The single player, co-op, Forge, multiplayer, all the maps, how the guns hold up, the AI, the ability to record your games, and what not. All I really need to say though, is it's worth it. There aren't many maps currently available to play on Halo 3, but just about all of them are a lot of fun. If you don't think they are at first, go ahead and play them a few times. The game looks good, controls great, and sounds fantastic. Almost everything about this game that I've seen so far is top notch.

4.0,True,"05 28, 2018",A2MCP2MTSKON9O,B01GW3P9PE,Subject7,"Overall it's a great game, but boy oh boy do I have grievances.

First, the game uses a new leveling system similar to role-playing games. Enemies who are a much higher level than you (8 is the max), are displayed with purple life bars and the ability to kill you with one hit. It is as cheap and as frustrating as it sounds. Call me crazy but when I'm playing a 3rd person action title like GOW, I'd like to know I lost due to my own ineptitude, not because the enemy had a bigger number.

Second, traversing the game world is a lesson in tedium, so much so that I wondered if Kratos was the God of War or the God of Backtracking. Most of the special areas or items you find are locked off by some kind of obstacle like red goo or vines or water or something, meaning you can only access them with special skills you unlock later. This wouldn't be a problem if I didn't spend ages rowing or walking to these places with a rather unhelpful map, no means of fast travel and no indication that I'm wasting my time and probably shouldn't bother till end game.

Then there's the lack of variety in enemy types. In past games you fought cyclops, minotaurs, centaurs, man-elephants, madusa-snake-women, bat-things, sea serpents, gods, titans, hell hounds, you name it. In this game however, you fight humanoids, wolves, flying eye balls and a dragon. I don't know if this limitation is due to the Norse setting, but it makes for fairly uninteresting enemy encounters.

Finally, increasing your level requires you to upgrade your armor with hard to find resources that cannot be farmed. This results in you playing most of the game under-powered because you're too afraid to experiment with current gear in-case you find better later. Some of the best armors can only be acquired at the end of the game when you no longer need them. I'm not sure what the point is especially with no New Game Plus mode.

Nevertheless, God of War is still a great game. The story is a little anti-climatic, the combat is a little clunky, the boy is annoying as hell and there are no more boobs...sigh.

4.0,True,"02 16, 2015",AOS82LROJ9OMT,B00J48MUS4,Justin,"The AC stories have always appealed to me more than the gameplay, but so far it's all very meh. The main story is less interesting than the side missions (though I'm only about halfway through) -- I was way more interesting in helping out Madame Tussaud than whatever hoops the main plot had me jump through. Maybe it's because the Creed is well-established in France with plenty of foot soldiers by the 1700s, but you just don't feel as ""special"" as the American contingent. The Arno/Elise storyline has potential, but so far I don't see why I should root for them. I don't see why I should really care about anyone at all.

Ubisoft's handling of the French is really troubling. Ezio's Italian accent may have been goofy at times, but 100% English accents in Paris really takes you out of the game. And to be honest, there hasn't been much happening related to the French Revolution, aside from occasional crowds lighting things on fire. Ezio took down the Borgias and tested Leonardo's inventions. Connor counseled Washington and threw tea off the boat. Shouldn't Arno be a *little* involved with French Independence?

The graphics are amazing. The framerates aren't bad, but I didn't get it until February. There's some repetition among the townspeople but it's still way more variety than previous entries. As for the gameplay, others have spoken to it better than me. The game-breaking bugs and faceless heads are gone, but there are still some real ""sticky"" points where movement suffers. Multiple times I've tried to jump silently into a haystack and landed on a sword, or stopped running because there's a box of potatoes on the ground. These things aren't constantly happening, but they happen enough to distance the immersion these games usually provide. I don't mind making the combat more difficult to encourage stealth, if the stealth wasn't so hard to pull off.

I'd be okay with clunky controls and a great story, or a lackluster story with smooth controls - but this falls short on both fronts. The irony is Ubisoft was obviously appealing to newbies here, but the only folks who'd stick with it are the die-hard AC fans. I know the next one will have more technical polish, but I hope they polish up the creative aspect as well.

---Updated 3/9

All the issues I had are still there (English accents, blah storyline so far) but the game is still an enjoyably immersive way to blow off steam. It doesn't make me as excited about the AC universe as prior games (Ezio, Edward, even Aveline) did, but it's solid distraction with a decent amount of historical faith. Hopefully the Victorian one gets a true story upgrade.","This has been okay, but I really wanted to like it.",1424044800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Instead of porting the classic PC version of the game, we get an all original game (level wise) that still has Duke's familiar graphics (though not as pretty looking as expected, but still shockingly good).

4.0,False,"11 3, 2010",A27G9LMQTMND03,B001CMJAP6,Patrick_91,"The Last Remnant starts out with a man named Rush Sykes looking for his sister Irina. Unfortunately for Rush he happens to step right into a battle field. From here Rush meets David, David is the young king of Athlem who is unusually intent in helping Rush find his sister, he even goes as far as to lend the help of his generals. All in all though this is your typical JRPG story.

Gameplay in the Last Remnant is something definitely unique, its a mix between a strategy RPG and a turn based RPG. You get whats called unions, leaders, and soldiers. You can have a max of 5 unions, a max of 6 leaders, and a max of 15 soldiers. In each union you are allowed up to 5 members, leaders are the main characters and soldiers are generics witch you have the option of recruiting (for free) by the end of the game you will find that having 4 unions (5 members in 2, and 4 members in 2 with 2 leaders in each union) works best. You can see all the enemies on the screen before you enter battle, so obviously there are no random battles. While you are in battle you can give general commands to your unions, ie: Attack with mystic arts (magic) or attack with combat arts (powerful attacks) or heal. What each character will do is almost completely random, you have very little control over what happens, sometimes it was just plain luck that I won some boss battles. The good thing about the battle system is that it is not an active one, meaning you don't have to worry about the enemy attacking you while you are thinking about what to do next.

The graphics in the Last Remnant are a mixed bag while character models look great and most environments are not far behind, textures take a long time to load sometimes you see 3 different sets of textures load one at a time! Why oh why Square Enix used the Unreal 3 engine is beyond me, this is a classic case of the developers just not being able o properly use the unreal engine. Square should have stuck with in house engine for the Last Remnant (crystal tools would have been perfect for the Last Remnant). Needless to say installing this game to your 360 is a must. (as a side note, Lost Odyssey also used the U3 engine and mist walker didn't have much, if any, problems with it.)

If I had one major gripe with the Last Remnant it would be that the main character isn't a very good leading man, I find his supporting cast members (particularly David) are the saving grace as this game would fall apart if it weren't for them.

One minor complaint I do have with the Last Remnant is how the difficulty of the game goes from a 5 (out of 10) to a 9 at the last major boss battle of disc 1. This lead to a lot of grinding and actually was more frustrating than enjoyable for me. At the start of disc 2 the difficulty relaxes a little only to slap you in the face again at the final stages of the game (the final 8 or so battles of the game) with an even bigger difficulty boost than the last time.

Overall the last remnant is a fairly good RPG, but is forgettable with very little memorable moments, unfortunately the technical issues combined with a few small problems that add up, stop The Last Remnant from becoming a classic 360 RPG.","A Great RPG, Even If It Is A Little Flawed...",1288742400,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

4.0,False,"10 14, 2008",A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00149MEVY,Terry Mesnard,"Silent Hill 2 is on my short list of favorite games, as it is, I'm sure, on most Silent Hill fans' lists.  It, and the first game, are shining examples of why this series is spectacular.  Unfortunately, they are the only two games that I feel are great in the series.  The third one felt more like a coda to the first (and was way too short), while the foruth one had more than a few design flaws that made me lose interest.

So, now the torch has been passed to Double Helix, an American developer, and the result is Silent Hill: Homecoming.  Even with its flaws (and boy does it have some), Homecoming has become my second/third favorite game of the series and bodes very well for Silent Hill's future.

The story begins with you, as Alex Shepherd, tied to a gurney and being pushed down dilapidated halls of some hellish hospital.  Looking to your right and left, you see even more disturbing sights as doctors drill into a patient or drop a body down a large and presumably deep hole.  Eventually, you're led into an observation room and left alone.  The doctor that left you is murdered, you break free of your bonds and have to make sense of where you're at.

Right away, the game had its hooks in me.  This first level terrifically set up the rest of the game, but also presented some genuine frights and more than a few disturbing sections.  From here, you'll go back home and try to figure out why Shepherd's Glen is cloaked in fog, where your brother left, why your mother seems catatonic and what exactly lurks in your flooded basement...

From a story perspective, Homecoming feels like a mix of Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2 (with a splash of Saw thrown in the mix), which is definitely a good combination.  Unfortunately, the story is also the most straight forward of the series (it's a Western game now) and while they try to mimic the essence of Silent Hill, they lose the ambiguous feel that tasks you with putting everything together.  By the end of the game, you pretty much know all there is to know.  Some might like that, but it was a sore spot for me.

The combat system, which was supposed to push Silent Hill into this new realm, isn't very good.  In fact, I found myself trying to avoid enemies more in Homecoming than in any of the previous titles.  On paper, it sounds good: light attack, strong attack and dodge.  But the problem is that you absolutely have to dodge attacks or even the lowly dogs will eat your face.  The problem is further amplified by the small, claustrophic areas you are in.  A lot of battles take place in very tight corners, making dodging very difficult.  And even when you successfully dodge in the small rooms, eventually you'll run into a corner, the camera will go wacky and you won't be able to see what you're fighting or, more importantly, see when to dodge.

Then, when you're in the big rooms, Double Helix is kind enough to throw two or three (or five) enemies at you at once.  Dodging one is a pain in the butt as it is, but trying to juggle three enemies is...well, it's hell.  Add to this some enemies with their gaseous breath that I could never seem to dodge and halfway through the game I never wanted to see another monster again.  And don't get me started on the boss fights...

So, why the four star review?  Because of what happens halfway through the game.  At the halfway point, the game ratchets up the tension, brings the story into new light and really made me want to play more.  In fact, I played the last half of the game in one sitting because I had to see how it was going to end.  The last half really makes up for any of the deficiencies in the game.

Graphically, Homecoming is obviously the best in the series.  The new sheen of gloss mostly works, though some of the monsters with the more colorful highlights (the gaseous monsters, for instance, with their red chests) look fake and break the color scheme.  Taking a page from the movie, the transitions to the other world are real time, with the paint flaking off and floating into nothingness.  It's cool but it's not as terrifying as waking up or just finding yourself in the other world.

And, of course, the music is phenominal.  Akira Yamaoka, series music/sound effects creator and producer, returns to craft a haunting score that mixes industrial with noises, rock and some heart-pumping effects.  Very awesome, some of the best of his music in my opinion.

In the end, Silent Hill: Homecoming is a great addition to the series.  It feels like the most cohesive Silent Hill story since the second game and tries to branch into new territories.  Having a new developer really helped the series avoid becoming stagnant.  And even with some faulting moments, it really is an involving and engrossing trip into hell.  Definitely recommend giving it a chance.",They say you can never really go back home,1223942400,62,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

Definitely good and better than most but not the greatest or in line to be the greatest and by a fairly large margin. But back to the game.

Mechanics:

I'll start with just the overall game play mechanics. For the most part, it's an easy transition in game mechanics from COD to this game. The only really noticeable difference is that the melee button is the R2 button opposed to the R3 and the R3 button is used for crouching (there is no prone position, which sucks). The button layout is pretty much standard, Triangle changes your weapons, circle picks stuff up, square reloads, x jumps, it has the more standard L1 to zoom when you aim opposed to the R3 to zoom that Halo uses and L2 throws your grenades. There are no kill streak calls so the d-pad is used for your gadgets, packs or specialty weapons. Standard stuff but the overall aim just seems to be either off or just not precise enough. Unless you're aiming at a stationary enemy with a sniper rifle, you never really fell like your aim and your shot are connecting. Many times I've found myself unloading full clips of an assault rifle on to an enemy a few steps away and nothing seems to hit but on the other hand I've used a handgun and shot a guy across the hall and got a headshot. The best I can describe the aim is that it's not precise. It feels floaty, and trying to hit a moving object while you're moving is either damn near impossible or you'll hit the other person while you're barely pointing at him. Shooting an assault gun while aiming, with a scope, while stationary in Battlefield feels like shooting a light machine gun from the hip in COD. It's always feel like a toss up when you're shooting and that alone will prevent this game from being a major competitor to the COD series.

Other Features:

Vehicles! One thing I've been hearing a lot is ""Does Call of Duty have vehicles?"" World at War had tanks but Modern Warfare 2 has nothing. For COD I don't think it works that great. For Battlefield, it works, In addition to vehicles being a differentiating feature from the COD games, Battlefield also has destructible environments. The destructible environments really change the way you think when you play because if you try to hide in a building, the walls can be taken down with the tanks or most explosives and that spot will no longer be a place you would want to go back to and hide... Probably because you won't be able to anymore for the duration of the match. In addition to tanks, you can take control of helicopters, uavs, 4 wheelers, armored transport vehicles, and jet skis. Most of the vehicles are just to go to point A to point B though because of the somewhat expansive maps. The controls for the vehicles take some getting used to but are easy enough to learn within one match or so, although I went into a helicopter once and somehow managed to turn it upside down and crash it within 10 seconds of lift off. As I said earlier, there are no kill streak type of call ins, well probably the mortar attack if you want to consider that but that doesn't involve a kill streak, it's a ""gadget"" and you load out with it and can use it after the meter fills back up when you use it, but basically, what would be a one touch call in in COD, you actually can control in Battlefield. Whether that better or worse is up to you but that's the difference.

Single Player:

I haven't played much of the single player yet but it's pretty much tacked on. It's pretty much what you expect where you shoot whatever that's in front of you until you hit a check point and that's it. It's definitely not a great cinematic epic experience like the Modern Warfare games are known for. This more feels like they took the pieces they can from the online game play and built a single player campaign with it. Let's face it though, you're not buying this for the single player, but if there was a choice between the game having this single player campaign and being full priced or being an online only game and being $10 less, then they should have done that. The only problem with that would have been that they would have lost sales from all the rental stores because then they wouldn't have carried it if it were an online only game.

Online:

Online has 3 different game types

Rush:
In Rush your team either has to destroy or defend two post. There's usually 3 or 4 sets of two post per game and when you destroy two post you move further down the map to the next two post until the end of the game or if you're defending, you have to get 75 kills on the other team before they destroy a set of post or they will progress to the next set and the kill count will be reset back to 75.

Conquest:
Conquest is like Domination in COD where there are spots where you have to take control of. To take control of each spot, it's actually a flag and you basically put your flag up to take control. It's a countdown from 130 I think and I think each point is 5 seconds or something like that so if you hold a position for 5 seconds, that's a point. Hold 3 position for 5 seconds and that's 3 points. Pretty much like Domination in COD.

Squad Death Match:
It's basically a death match but instead of one side versus another side it's one side of two squads vs. another side of two squads with four people per squad. I don't really know the point of that but it doesn't really seem different than a typical death match. The first squad to reach 50 is the winner of the match.

With the only play though, I've had a pretty good experience with thhe connection so far. I've logged about 12 hours online in that game so far and have only had a handful disconnects and the lag is barely noticeable if there happens to even be some. I haven't noticed and of the jerky movements, slowdown or odd ""teleportation"" that you get in COD at least once a day, so considering that I'm on PSN and I'm not really having problems I'd imagine that XBL would be even better.

Overall:

Overall it's a very good game. The online game play is solid but there are some flaws that can detract from the overall experience. The maps are large and because of that, camping is almost encouraged. I'm usually never a camper but because the maps are so large, you pretty much need to use the sniper rifle until you can get some other good weapons and attachments that can at least make you competitive in a match. Another problem is the spawning. You have a choice of where you can spawn and you can either spawn at your home base, at a ""random"" spawn point or you can do a ""squad spawn"" and spawn from the location of one of your team mates. All seem to spawn you in the middle of an enemies crosshairs. The random spawn always seems to spawn you right in the middle of the action and you'll probably be dead within 10 seconds. The base spawn is probably the safest way to spawn but you'll be on the other end of the map and if an enemy can make their way to the base, they can easily camp somewhere around it and just wait until people start popping up and snipe them at will. The squad spawn is a great idea but it can lead to a bunch of cheap kills.

I also have issue with the aiming and hit detection. There have been a number of time where I'm unloading 50 rounds into an enemy that's barely 5 steps away from me and nothing seems to connect and they'll hit me with a headshot with a handgun. I've also thrown grenades right at people on an open field, had them explode and once again nothing happens. As I said earlier, it's a toss up and frustrating at times. To me this is what makes COD a better game overall than this one. It's more of a technical issue rather than a game issue but in this case, it really detracts for the game.

The graphics are a bit ugly as well. It's most likely due to the fact that the maps are so expansive and so much of it is destructible that the visuals had to take dip in quality. It's not that big of a deal but at times it's hard to distinguish a character, especially if they're in some sort of shrubbery.

One more thing I have a big problem with is that there' doesn't seem to be any muting of people in the game. I have this on the PS3 and way less people have headsets compared to the 360, yet there always seems to be one person that had a headset on where every time there's a baby crying, some dude arguing with his girlfriend, or some stupid kid asking if anyone is there. This seems to happen more on squad death match than the other game types but not having the option to mute people dissuades me from playing that game type.

Of course this game is going to be compared to Call of Duty and it's probably not a fair comparison. The best way I can put it is that one is Chess and the other is Checkers. Both are completely different games but play on the same surface. In this case, both games are first person shooters but are completely different experiences. I'm thoroughly enjoying this game, it does have it's flaws but it's still a very solid enjoyable game.

There are, however, almost no similarities between Nano Assault and either of the two Nanostrays. For one thing, the word 'nano' is actually appropriate in this title, as you play a Nanite ship that is attacking viruses and hostile microorganisms in someone's brain. The game does a good job of portraying the strange environment of human innards at the micro level: it is like an alien world!

The campaign isn't terribly long (longer than any given path in Star Fox 64 3D, at least), and in each cell there are three different types of stages to complete. One is an open-ended shooter where you travel across the surface of a cell, collect strands of DNA, and wipe-out enemy organisms. The second type is an on-rails segment (much like Star Fox). And the third is a boss fight. This clockwork structuring of levels works well, and I was glad to see a small variety of play styles presented.

The core of this game is arcade-style point scoring, and arcade mode accomplishes just that. There is also a fun boss rush mode as well. Along with other unlockables (which can be accessed using accumulated 'nano coins,' I believe they are called), this title should keep you busy for a while.

The boss fights are notable in this game. They are usually very clever and challenging, and the player must find a way to defeat a boss in a specific fashion.

One thing I love in this title are the changeable special weapons. Each special weapon has a variety of strengths and weaknesses, and it is fun to experiment with all of them.

The graphics are pretty nice looking in 2D mode, but move the slider up to 3D and you will be amazed by the depth and beauty of the 3D. This little game is easily one of the most eye-popping on the 3DS, and the alien environments are given remarkable life through the utilization of 3D.

So far I've talked about what the game does right. What does it do wrong? Well, for one thing, the game self-adjusts the difficulty based upon how you play. Now, I know some people will like this, but I've always loved muscling through tough levels in games without having to tank the difficulty. Moreover, there is a notable lack of variety in the levels. All the worlds look very similar, so you will get a sense of deja-vu as you play through the campaign. It is also questionable how long the unlockables and arcade mode will keep the average player coming back.

Ultimately, however, this is a fantastic shooter, and a super bargain for the price it is at on Amazon. As I write this review, it is under $20. THAT is a terrific bargain. Get it as soon as you can!","Eye-popping 3D, hardcore shooter action, and a budget price!",1332806400,,,
4.0,False,"09 18, 2014",A1PWET8GVKR291,B0093FQ9KI,Deanna L. Melin,"Pros: SNES-styled construction, simple interface, NES/SNES/Super Famicom compatible, game-genie compatible, S-Video output

Cons: Light-weight, thin plastic, questionable cartridge connector quality, odd controller port layout, feeble power button, garbage controllers

Other thoughts: Don't let my ""Cons"" dismay you. Unless you plan to shell out the dough for the newer RetroN 5, this may just be the best (reasonably priced) NES/SNES clone on the market. Contrary to the Hyperkin numbering scheme, the RetroN 2 is actually a newer product than the RetroN 3. The numbers apparently reflect the number of cartridge slots...

While I don't have an SNES cheat device to test, I can attest that the NES Game Genie works just fine.

The controllers that come with the system recognize button inputs just fine, but the d-pad is sloppy and sticks so far out of the controller that it's easy to press too hard and inadvertently depress another direction. If you don't have original controllers, buy some. They work perfectly with the system.

Cartridges seem to interface just fine, as they are almost always recognized first-try, but the connectors leave a lot of play once games are inserted. This is kind of the opposite of the normal death-grip that clones or new 72-pin connectors are prone to. Again, it doesn't seem to affect the game/console interface, but I wouldn't go and wiggle anything while playing (or even accidentally nudge it, if I were you). Who knows, maybe the looser fit will add to the life of my cartridges... The eject button only works with SNES/Super Famicom games, and it tends to launch the titles a good distance out of the console if you don't have a hand ready, so be prepared.

I can't speak much to compatibility, as I don't have a huge library, but so far all of my games have worked. Just keep in mind that this is another Nintendo-on-a-chip, so not everything is going to run, and the emulation is not going to be perfect. If you're a purist, buy an original NES and SNES and deal with the inherent cost and frustrations. If you're just buying it to have fun or perhaps preserve your existing consoles, go for it! Heck, some games run BETTER on this than the original console, and if you're not one who agonizes over a game not glitching or slowing down in the same places as in the original, you'll probably appreciate that. Athena (don't torture yourself by playing it) runs noticeably smoother on this clone than on my original NES-001, as an example.

The console comes with S-Video out, which provides a noticeable increase in the quality of the SNES display. The NES will run through the S-Video cord as well (unlike on the RetroN 3), but you'll find that the colors are muted. NES works better with the supplied AV cables. The down-side is you have to physically disconnect the S-Video cable when playing the NES for the system to default to the AV output. Personally, I've just taken to playing with slightly muted colors most of the time.

I've not done a side-by-side comparison with the audio, but so far nothing has bothered me. There is a little background noise during game silence, but once a game's music and sound effects kick in, you can't hear it.

So, would I recommend you pick one of these up? For $40, why not! It's a solid purchase.","Not perfect, but good enough for a NOAC",1410998400,13,,

Bakehorn,"Planet Moon Studios, the Scottish development squad credible for Citizen Kabuto and Armed & Dangerous, has another quirky title ready for gamers looking for something different in their action games. Infected, one of the most recent PSP releases, is a solid action title that is fast-paced and serves as a quick fix and a solid foundation for the PSP action/shooter genre.
In Infected, you play the role as an anti-viral officer named Stevens who must attempt to stop the contamination of New York City. A strange virus has infected the citizens of the city, including Stevens. Oddly, the virus doesn't affect Stevens the same as everyone else, and his blood is discovered to be the only way to kill the virus and those citizens who turned into flesh-eating zombies. So a viral gun is created, and it's your job to run around New York City turning all of the zombies into clouds and piles of blood and gore. The story doesn't really appear throughout the game but the few events you will see are funny enough that you'll want to listen to and watch what is happening on the screen.
The action hits you from the first mission and doesn't stop until you're tired of killing zombies. The game takes place in five different real-life NYC locations, including Central Park and Greenwich Village. In almost every level, you'll fight off hordes of the zombies while rescuing uninfected civilians, defending locations, and clearing places for evacuation helicopters to land. The way to kill the zombies is to weaken them until they change in color, which is your indication to use the viral gun that kills them off. Though this might sound like it takes more time than it should, the pace never slows from an all-out rush. Whether you're beating missions and earning medals on the single player or you're ""infecting"" the world with your in-game avatar in the Ad Hoc/Infrastructure wireless modes, there is surprisingly a lot to do in Infected. On top of that, there is an incentive to earn gold medals on each level, because these medals unlock things like new costumes, character faces, weapon upgrades, and more. These upgrades, especially the weapon ones, make the game even faster and more frantic than before, and they make your in-game avatar even more unique.
Even with such a fast pace, Infected looks good and plays smoothly. There isn't much variation between enemy models, though there are a few different types. That said, the models are pretty generic but look good all the same. The environments are detailed with different buildings, trees, and other environment pieces while a constant snow lays down on New York City. Of course, all that snow is broken up by firey explosions and red, bloody clouds when multiple viral gun kills are linked together. The explosions, gunshots, and blood splatter noises are fantastic alongside music from metal bands like Slipknot, Fear Factory, Chimera, and one of my personal favorite bands, Trivium. All of this graphical and audio presentation never stutters the frame rate, which runs very smoothly throughout the game. The controls don't hold things up, either. Except for movement, they're simple and rely on two or three main buttons to get the job done.
Infected's head-banger soundtrack and fast paced, no-brains-necessary action is very similar to a third-person, handheld version of Serious Sam. Whether that's your cup of tea or not is a different story, but I enjoyed Infected quite a lot. It's not the best PSP game, and you won't be playing it until next Christmas, but it's got the virus-infected charm and bloody, gory fun to keep action fans playing for quite some time.

The game runs silky smooth on my system with DX11 and everything on high.

As for the gameplay, it's mostly enjoyable, but it gets pretty repetitive in parts, and some bits of it don't work as well as they should.

My favorite parts were the crime scene investigations and interrogations.  They did a decent job of making you feel like it is you, the player, who is connecting the dots between the evidence and the suspects, although, sadly, this is the part of the game that feels the most repetitive.  I wish there could have been a little more depth to it.  Rather than having 1 correct response out of 3 while questioning someone, there should have been more ways to respond with varying degrees of success.  I know that would have required more recorded dialog (The amount of which is staggering already), but it would have been more than worth it since this is what you spend a majority of your time in the game building up to and doing.

The parts I didn't like in the game were the ""tailing"" sections.  Especially the ones on foot.  I'm sorry, Team Bondi, but your cover system is probably the worst I've ever seen in a game.  The controls feel unresponsive and ""sticky"" and I hated using the system entirely.  I wish you had just put a dedicated crouch button and left it at that.  Along the same lines, the ""incognito"" mode is almost totally worthless, as I was never able to use it correctly at the times that I needed to.

However, going through the story is a lot of fun.  It's mostly well-written and the characters are engaging and well-acted.  I actually cared what happened to Cole as I was progressing, which is not something that I normally do when playing a game.  Seeing that the majority of the game is cut-scenes and lengthy dialog, this is obviously the most important thing to consider in reviewing the game, and I thought it was quite good.  The setting, the clothing, the music, the period-slang, and the gritty noir cop-drama style hit a homerun for me.  I think in this aspect, the game did exactly what it set out to do.

I bought the game on Steam for peanuts, so I don't regret the purchase at all.  I doubt I would have regretted paying full price for it either.

Most of the big-name console RPGs these days are heavy on dialog and graphics, and have adopted the so-called ""sandbox"" style of play where you can make moral decisions that affect the game world. Those are all good and well, but for those looking to just plug in a game, go kill stuff and collect sweet loot, this is the game for you. Here, you don't have to worry about selecting the right dialog option, or whether to help one side or another. You just take a quest and go kill stuff. Not only that, but you don't have to spend extra money on downloadable content to make this game worth it. With the multi-player aspects, this  truly brings back the revelry of Diablo II. You can play online or with a friend on the same console, even bringing your characters with you on a Memory Unit. Most multi-player RPGs these days are MMOs which require subscriptions and/or heavy time commitments and guild politics. Sacred 2 is great because it caters to both casual and hardcore players, where you can pop into a game for an hour or so, whenever you want, or stick with a close group of hardcore players with long sessions. The game scales enemies based on your level and how many players are in your party, so if someone joins you, then has to leave later, you can keep playing without worry. The closest comparison I can think of is Marvel Ultimate Alliance, but Sacred 2 offers more depth in terms of building your character

The game world is HUGE, I'm 8 hours in and have only uncovered 5% of the map. There is also a huge selection of items, and different ways to distribute attributes and combat arts focus. Each increased difficulty level raises your level cap as well, providing tons of replay value.

Honestly, I was surprised that I was able to get this game used for less than half its original price in the first year. After reading some of the negative reviews, I think most of the complaints were fixed in a recent patch. (The negative reviews for the PC version are mostly anti-DRM fanatics who didn't even review the game). Anyhow, there are a few issues which kept me from giving this 5-stars. Once you get into the game, these are really minor annoyances, rather than game-breaking flaws. First and foremost is the lack of a proper trade window. When you trade with another player, both your inventories pop up, and you just select the items and it instantly gives it to the other person. There really needs to be a secondary trade window like in most RPGs(including Diablo II), where you can confirm a trade. Fixing this alone would go a long way to increasing multiplayer interactions. The other issue is the button configuration. I think this was just poor porting from the PC. For example, to trade you click the left bumper while in range of the player you want to trade with. But, LB is also what you click to pick up items, open containers, talk to NPCs and get on your mount, so you will often unintentionally open the trade window. While we're on mounts, to dismount, you have to hold down the right bumper, bringing up the menu, and then select ""Dismount,"" and hold down the A button. This takes entirely too long. Dismount should be a one-button push. The other annoyance is the inability to pause the game, even in an offline single player game. I don't know why they did this, but it is really annoying.

Anyways, I would like to state the enjoyable aspects of this game far outweigh the minor flaws. While most RPGs have gone the way of Oblivion or Bioware-style dialog, Sacred 2 brings back the instant gratification and multiplayer fun of Diablo II to your console.

4.0,False,"01 28, 2015",AVVIJ7EBPS4EI,B00D2ZK1IG,Casey,"The combination of a well developed Parkour movement system and a large open city that supports a tremendous amount of traversal possibilities is what immediately sets this game apart. It just makes sense that adding vertical movement is the perfect response to your shambling and mindless zombies (during the day that is!). Of course things change at night, which is another huge plus for the game as the challenges of navigating in the dark, combined with far more agile and developed infected create an extremely different and many times scary reality. The game rewards the risk to brave the night though, which is a great design aspect.

The city is well developed with a lot of details, tons of fully implemented and explorable spaces. There's a wide variety of materials and objects in the world, which makes it very immersive. Valuables and resources are spread throughout, so exploring is worthwhile. Collectibles are not highlighted by silly game highlighting - they just look like the sorts of things that you would expect in real life: e.g. Closets, refrigerators, police cars, and cash registers hold appropriate items and are always worth checking.

Zombies are not easy to kill. When you first start the best way is to push them into massive spikes that someone has left throughout the city for some unimaginable reason. Kicking zombies off ledges at height is great fun, as well as shoving them into fire. There is a great emphasis on environment awareness and interaction, which is necessary especially for larger groups which are dangerous even in the day. A lot if this is really not plausible, but thankfully it's fun enough to ignore while playing.

The leveling system is very well implemented, with an Elder Scrolls use-it-to-advance-it mentality. Meaning the more you fight the better you get at it. The more you parkour the more agility exp you get and the faster you get new agility skill points (very worth focusing on!).

It's too bad you cannot create, or at least select, your own character. I know it would be an investment to add a second set of voice acting and a new character model, but it seems like a game that could have easily implemented a playable female character. Especially with four player co-op options, this would have been really nice.

Weapon mods get annoying as the animations and noises of fire and electrical modded weapons are persistently in your face. The effects are cool and necessary in combat, but it's too bad you don't have any sort of holstering, especially as you're focused on free running across the city. Weapons break far too quickly, and it isn't clear why an already crappy knife needs to be constantly repaired with metal pieces in order to keep going. The notion of items breaking adds realism and resource management, but it's hampered by the silly repair process which happens constantly. To repair: step back, hold a button for 5 seconds and magically everything is in pristine condition again.

One of the larger disappointments is the plot/setting. The premise, in my opinion, takes a lot away from the immersive reality of the game. The notion that the outside world has walled up a single, massively infected city, and does nothing to help the survivors is not completely unbelievable... but once they start consistently air-dropping in supplies you have to wonder. If they care enough to randomly carpet bomb supplies on the city, why not, well... try and save anyone? There's certainly a conspiracy theory aspect to the game, which accounts for some of this, but it is cliche, poorly written, and the voice acting only brings it down further.
Along the same lines, most of the dialogue is rather ridiculous. The main character, still essentially a stranger, walks into an in-progress meeting, says ""I'll do it"" and off you go! I'm excited to get back to the action, but The Last of Us proves that with good writing and characterization, a game can turn into something much more than just some fun mechanics and graphics.

Switching between Kharg and Darc means you don't have to deal with the same characters throughout the whole thing and the story is quite intriguing once you learn all their secrets.

When I started playing, I thought I was out [$$]because it's very difficult to aim your weapons with the right stick, and I couldn't figure out where I needed to go or what I needed to do to finish this level.  But once I pressed the select button for hints and got off of the beach, I found this game to be much more enjoyable.  Most of the missions have to do with spy work, sneaking behind enemy lines, paratrooping in and going through villages after Nazis, and so on.  This stuff made the game great - I could take my time, sneak around, listen to the guards yelling in German (...) and snipe the enemies off from a distance.  The play varies from working with groups to sneaking into strange situations, like blowing up a U-Boat from the inside or sneaking through a German resport disguised as a waiter.  It's fun stuff, and doesn't require the kind of high-test hand/eye work that only a 13-year old Mario addict can muster.  The realism is decent; if you saw Saving Private Ryan, you'll recognize the style of the villages and soforth, and the gun sounds are more realistic than your average blam-blam effect.  It's also hard to see guards when it's hazy and they are on a rooftop.  But it's not 100% realistic, and your exploration options are limited (which I think is a plus).  The controls are the worst part - it takes a lot of work to get used to the aiming with the right stick, and sometimes I spend forever getting shot at from a three foot range because I can't get the stupid gun moved over.

4.0,False,"05 16, 2017",A2N60VDBR10N18,B01GW90XFY,Tyler Johnson,"Prey is a difficult game to review. Despite delivering a tremendous experience, one that every fan of games and sci-fi should get in on, said experience is marred by the ""game"" part of the package. Now before I dive deeper into Prey, I want to be clear, this is a game you should experience. I am recommending this game. That recommendation however, comes with caveats.

You follow Morgan Yu, who can thankfully be a man or a woman, as they delve deeper into exactly what is happening at the company Transtar. I dare not give more than that away because the story of Prey is, unquestionably, its strongest point. You're thrown an early curve ball and quickly find yourself in over your head and scrambling to survive. You will be exploring every inch of the incredible station, Talos 1, a stunningly gorgeous environment that never gets boring, with enemies, secrets, and stories dripping from the very walls. You'll never get too comfortable exploring because in Prey, the main enemies are mimics. They can be most thing's in the environment and they will be hunting you the entire game. This makes the beginning of the game tense and exciting. You never know when one may appear or even if that shiny item you're reaching for its really what it appears to be. Unfortunately, the novelty of this wears off VERY quickly.

You see, BECAUSE Prey's story is so strong, because Talos 1 is such a joy to explore, and because said exploration is so satisfying, having to constantly be on the look out for enemies that could be anything in the environment, or larger enemies that spawn at random ready to ruin your day, the immersive feel of Talos 1 is never able to be fully realized. Halfway through the game, I began to tire of having to deal with the distressingly constant stream of increasingly powerful enemies everywhere I went. By the time I began backtracking to places that I had meticulously cleared of enemies, only to find said areas filled with a greater number than before, and far more powerful, I actually began to resent the game.

That's because the world of Prey is deep, rich, and immersive. All I wanted to do was lose myself in the story of those who came before. Their hopes, dreams, relationships, fears, and eventual downfalls. The world of Prey is alive despite being nearly devoid of life. I came to care for certain characters that I'd never met, and knew only though the audio logs I found along the way. That is a rare and precious thing to come across. The constant threat of enemies might have been more tolerable if you actually gained anything from combat but the meager reward for slaying a foe is far offset by the price you pay in overly precious ammunition, medpacks, and psi ammo you'll burn through fighting them. Hell, I could even excuse this if the combat itself was satisfying but the enemies are one trick ponies. Once you see what they can do, they'll never surprise you again. It's simply a matter of getting their pattern down and killing them. Combat becomes stale, mainly because while your enemies pay no cost in attacking, every shell or power you use costs you in some way, and it becomes increasingly expensive to replenish your dwindling supplies. Sure you could just melee everything into oblivion but unless you're willing to sink precious mods into making the wrench effective, you're going to be using a weapon or a power.

Mods power everything about you in Prey. From how fast you run, how far your throw, to more exotic feats like blasts and shape shifting, all of it is accomplished through mods. While there are more than enough mods to, eventually, make your character a force, the scarcity of ammo, and high number of mods needed to be truly effective coupled with the fact that by the time you reach this point, every square inch of the game will be crawling with hordes of high leveled enemies, you're never allowed to truly explore without fear, which is a shame. The game says you can play it your way, running and gunning or stealthing it out, but the stealth mechanics are slow, boring, and ineffective. Simply running from all your problems is far faster, less effort, and saves on items.

Prey suffers from wanting to be tense and scary throughout, while also trying to have an interesting and engaging story throughout, and unfortunately the former interferes with the latter. For me, Prey is never truly scary and tense quickly becomes tedious. But the story only gets better, with an ending that I didn't see coming and made me crave a sequel very badly. That may sound odd, seeing as the tone of this review seems negative, but as I said, despite all these criticisms, Prey manages to deliver an amazing experience through its setting, characters, and story. The game mechanics, while irksome, are more than functional, and I truly believe this game is worth experiencing, even if that means only renting it. While I can't say this game is a buy, I implore you to rent or borrow it because Prey is a worthwhile experience.","Amazing experience, mediocre game",1494892800,7,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

K,"As you could guess, being a film student and all, that I prefer slightly the cinematic fear of the Biohazard/Resident Evil series over this, much more eerie style of fear, but that doesn't mean that this game didn't scare me as much, if not more.
What's so great about Silent Hill is that the danger has a sense of reality to it, unlike in Resident Evil where you really just fight some monsters who jump through windows at you and watch some highly entertaining scenes. The fog adds a new element of fear, in which something might be out there; and with the radio, you KNOW when there is an unseen terror lurking in the shadows or precipitation. Real life is more like that: where you can't see your enemies, not where they are just big enough to withstand several direct shotgun shots.
However, enough comparisons to the horror-king series, because this game is neither better nor worse. This game is simply different. Your hero isn't a cop, and the disaster is much more philosophical and fantastic than scientific, which isn't just Resident Evil, but also Parasite Eve. This isn't as much X-Files as it is the Twighlight Zone.
The story is about Harry Mason, an average Joe, coming to the resort town: Silent Hill, with his daughter. What he doesn't realize is that at that very time, the forces of darkness are struggling, almost fighting one another. As a result, there are many dead people around, and the town itself is now pulsating with evil. Sometimes he'll leave a building, where the time of day, or the design of the town will change within seconds, right before his eyes. However, after each boss battle, all the super-levels of darkness will subside, and the daytime will come about again, where the danger is much more scarce; it's kind-of like Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (a true classic), where there are times of light evil, and times of overwhelming evil. However, unlike Simon's Quest, you cannot just wait it out.
The main point that I'm trying to make, is that this game is easily as scary as Resident Evil, but it's less in the real world; yet, it has a strange sense of familiarity to it. However, if you were brought up with the other survival horror world, than don't expect this to just me one of the better entries; this is it's own unique bloodline (well, Fear Effect was similar, but THIS is MUCH MUCH BETTER!!). I know horror players who have given up on this game due to the fact that it is too scary. I have myself, and I'm sure all these other reviewers did as well.

Some new things in terms of scenary. LL really has a lot of new themeing types, which is always fun. The CF features that carry over are new entertainers, music choices, painting colors and section painting.  If you are really into the whole themeing thing then this is truly the expansion pack for you.
Rides: CF gives you a lot of new gentle rides, and a few thrill rides.  Around 10-12 new rollercoasters really add to the gameplay as they are all different, and fun. One new thing you'll see alot of with LL is water rides. Jet skis, water coasters, raft rides etc. are all brand new which is a good change.  In terms of ride improvements you get a lot of new rollercoaster cart types which is cool.
SHOPS: There are tooooons of new shops so if you wanna make more money this is an easy way.  There is everything from tee-shirt and hat stalls to fried chicken and coffee shops.
BAD THINGS: Some major bummers: you can no longer charge admission to your park, which is wear [i think] a lot of the money comes from.  Also you can't research ride improvements which I guess is OK cuz you get the stuff you'd be researching then.

4.0,False,"03 30, 2013",A2P6GX8V66XLAD,B009SPZ11Q,Eric H. Lee,"This might be the most hyped game I can remember in recent history, with the majority of published reviews giving 9/10-10/10 scores.  You would imagine the game is absolute perfection, which in my book would involve 1) a compelling story, environment, and character development to invest the player into the game, 2) beautiful graphics, 3) introducing a novel gameplay strategy, and 4) giving the player a unique experience where decisions matter.

Pros:
Nice graphics and exterior environments of Columbia are mesmerizing
Skyhook is fun and adds a new strategy to the game
Elizabeth as a non combatant sidekick is very clever

Cons:
Completely non interactive environment and NPCs - for such a pretty game, they really struck out in making the environment even minimally interactive - it has absolutely zero life or character
""Sidequests/optional objectives"" are a joke - the game is effectively 100% linear
Poorly fleshed out villians - you neither like them nor hate them, they are just there to reach (but you do not directly defeat them either)
Decisions don't matter, because the game doesn't ask you to make any
Rather shallow backstories for all the main characters, even after the ending is revealed
Low replay value - your decisions don't matter, the plot is completely linear, so why replay it other to say I beat a higher difficulty setting
The game is quite short - you can beat it, taking your time to explore everything, in 10-15 hours max.  If you fly through it, it is less than 10 hours.

The long detailed version:

1) For those who have played Bioshock in the past, part of the appeal of the game is the immersion into the dystopian setting of Rapture.  I have played Bioshock 1 but not 2, and admit, the dark and claustrophobic environment of Rapture never appealed to me much because every environment looks the same.  The flying city of Columbia remedies the closed in feeling - every single environment is wide open and even the indoor environments have impossibly high ceilings, so you never feel that closed in.  The exterior environments in Bioshock Infinite capture the turn of century Victorian style quite well; however I have to admit most of the interior environments look exactly the same.  Am I trekking through Fink Industry's headquarters, a warehouse, a train station, or a museum?  Well, it is tough to tell since they all have the same stairways, hallways, service desk rooms, etc..  The same goes for the bad guys.  There is little difference between Comstock's bad guy police force and the Vox Populi terrorists.  The ""big hitters"" make somewhat rare appearances, and while it is kind of neat shooting the heads off the chaingun robots, for the most part the villians lack a shock and awe of bosses from other games.  The Handyman is a pretty neat villian, and being given the ability to electrify the skyhook rail was a nice addition.  However, the named villians such as Fitzroy and Comstock end up as antiheros rather than true villians - there isn't a boss fight with either of them.

I would have to say the biggest disappointment I had with the game was the lack of interaction with other characters.  You can't even have a conversation with Elizabeth short of programmed cutscenes where something traumatic has happened to her.  And I do not think there was ever a direct conversation with any of the other named villians such as Comstock, Fitzroy, or Fink.  I know this is supposed to be a shooter, but given the excellent shooter/RPGs that have come out since the original Bioshock, you would think the development team would have learned that interactive conversations with the main characters in a story help to flesh out both the protagonist and the supporting characters.  Think Mass Effect or Dragonage for an example of where conversations with the secondary characters add tremendously to the scope of the story.  This is completely lacking in Bioshock Infinite, and as a result, it is difficult to invest in the game or feel any emotion for any of the characters, even Booker or Elizabeth (maybe Elizabeth a little bit because of her long term forced confinement).  Also, none of the NPCs are interactive at all, and all they do is stand there doing nothing.  When 4 year old Oblivion has NPCs walking around going about their daily activities, and even living in their own homes, the lack of interactivity with the environment in Bioshock Infinite is a big letdown.  I know Bioshock hasn't traditionally had this, but being able to explore a little bit more would have been fun.  Even Borderlands 2 has more exploration, and you can at least talk to the various NPCs and hear unique replies.  None of this exists in Bioshock Infinite.

I won't spoil the ending here, other than to say that the big twist that the reviewers mention is kind of there, but kind of not.  There is a twist, and I did enjoy the extended ending chapter which advanced the plot - why couldn't they have had four of five of those segments during the actual game?  They actually advance the plot more than hearing a voice over the elevator speaker or listening to a recording.  Overall I found the plot rather contrived, and when they are dealing with rifts in space-time, they could have come up with a much more clever plot.  It was like they wrote on a white board the ideas of - maiden in tower, racism/exceptionalism, rips in space time, ye olde 1900 setting, and came up with a mishmash story.  It is neither coherent nor sweeping, and without the extended cutscenes like the final chapter of the game, it doesn't draw the player in.

2) The graphics are excellent, but not cutting edge.  Even on my three year old rig with SLI GTX470's, on maxed out ultra settings, the game runs without a hitch - however this may be due more to driver optimizations than the actual demands of the game.  It would have been great if the NPCs had unique designs and faces - but they don't.  At the beach scene, I think there were two female models and three male models, to represent the dozens of people scattered on the beach.  Simply boring and lazy on the part of the design team.  If Sanctuary in Mass Effect could be filled with hundreds of people, and come off looking as if they were actually unique NPCs, why can't Bioshock?  Five years development time?  What were they doing, taking a nap?  That said, the graphics are appropriate for the game - the exterior environments are beautiful and the interior environments feel spacious.  As stated above, the interior environments end up looking a little generic though.

3) Unique gameplay?  Well there is the skyhook which is fun to use.  It does add a ""killer app"" dimension to the game which other games do not have, and I think this is a very nice addition to the traditional shooter.  The vigors are a rework of the traditional plasmid, and have similar effects although they are rather more spectacular in Bioshock Infinite.  The chaining effects for shock jockey, and hurling the bad guys into the air with bucking bronco are pretty fun to use, and do spice up combat somewhat.  The weapons are less spectacular, and it would have been nice to see some change in their firing effects when you upgrade them.  Borderlands 2 has set the standard for having a ton of neat weapons to motivate the player, and to only have a standard set of weapons in Bioshock Infinite (and rather limited ammo) is adequate but not that exciting.

The addition of Elizabeth as a non combatant sidekick is terrific.  The designers nailed it that she does not use a gun, and does not actively fight.  She is not completely 100% support either, because in addition to magically finding ammo and salt during combat, she also unlocks doors for you and finds the occasional lockpick or spare change.  I know the development team made a big deal of how complicated her AI is, and if they applied the same to other NPCs in the game (instead of having them stand around uselessly) it would have really made the game more fun and interactive.  As such, Columbia doesn't really feel like a living city, more of a static one. Even the Vol Populi allies you fight with at some point seem rather static - they will fight but not actively advance beyond where Booker is.  The combat AI in Dragonage was so much better.  Furthermore, while Elizabeth has keyed moments where she interacts with the environment, these are few and far in between, and the preview video where she thinks a cheap statue is gold or where she puts on a Lincoln mask are absent from the game - more moments like those would have introduced some fun and levity instead of making Elizabeth always seem conflicted, brooding, and two dimensional.

4) Do your decisions matter? Nope.  Not a single one.  Well there is the one where you can throw the ball at the stage presenter, and you get a present from the interracial couple later on.  But that is all I can remember.  Five year in development?  Give me a break.  Mass Effect and Dragonage have mastered plotlines where decisions lead to forks in the main plot, how can a team spend five years on ""the greatest shooter story ever"" and not come up with at least a few instances where individual decisions matter?  As such, everyone playing Bioshock will see the exact same game, with the minor difference in weapons and vigors employed.  Otherwise, the plot is the same, the combat is the same, the environments are the same, and the ending is the same.  The side quests of finding codes and ciphers are very limited, and I would not even call them sidequests.  As such, the game is very linear with the only incentive to explore being to acquire more coins and gear, but not really to add to the plot.

4/5, or 80% seems appropriate to me.

Edit: after thinking about it a little more, 4/5 is generous.  As Amazon doesn't allow half stars, I'll go with 3.5/5 in text but will stick with the four star rating.

Taking the Resident Evil series out of it's survival horror roots and turning it into and action-adventure series is one of the best things to happen (in my opinion as I never found the original Resident Evil's all the scary). Resident Evil 5 is a very impressive follow-up and while it doesn't really stand too far apart from RE4, it's a very engaging game in it's own right.

The story of Resident Evil 5 puts you in the role of series character Chris Redfield. After events separate him from his former partner Jill Valentine, Chris finds himself teaming up with Sheva Alomar in investigating a bio-weapon threat in Kijuju (a fictional African town). The story plays out in an action-oriented manner as Chris and Sheva fight their way through zombie-infected townspeople, soldiers and monsters  while discovering the truth behind the outbreaks and puts Chris face to face with an old nemesis. While the plot is an exciting one (and very much like Resident Evil 4) it's the African setting that keeps you engaged and unnerved with a few elements (issues of bio-terrorism, illegal experimentation on native peoples, anti-colonial themes) that come surprisingly close to reality...for a video game. The voice acting in this game is also very solid and the voice-actors playing Chris, Sheva and Josh Stone (Sheva's mentor who bails them out more than once and gets his own DLC starring role) are very likeable and engaging.

The gameplay in Resident Evil 5 is very fun, though borrows a bit too heavily from RE4. You still can't walk when you aim and unless you're running Chris and Sheva move somewhat sluggishly. The quick-button inventory is a good idea and I liked how you can see your items on your characters even when you're not using them, but I would've preferred a bigger inventory pool (similar to RE4's briefcase). There's no reason they couldn't have mixed and matched this. Also, while I like the co-op idea of having two characters at once I would've liked the opportunity to switch between controlling Chris and Sheva on the fly instead of just picking one at the beginning and giving orders to the other.

Resident Evil 5 is very much an action-adventure game and a good one at that. There were some miss-fires with the gameplay and some missed opportunities but that hasn't stopped me from coming back to it. Now with some good DLC packages (and a nice price-drop) I recommend Resident Evil 5 to any action fan.",Fun yet familiar gameplay....,1294531200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

You can choose to sneak around in the dark or arrow blazing but you are limited to how many you can carry plus other items such as choke arrows to knock out dogs and birds, 2 types of lethal spearhead arrows, blunt arrows (very cheap) for distant buttons, stun grenades, water arrows for lit torches, flame arrows, blast arrows, rope arrows and a few others.

These items will be used to make the game easier such as a less populated path would be accessible with a rope arrow that you can attach to a beam and get across, easily travel in the dark if you launch a water arrow into a torch and knock out some guards with ease, if guards bunch up and stand over a dead body then you can launch a blast arrow and kill 4 goons at once.

There are different settings in the game and the most important would be custom settings, which is an achievement and it should be.  You can customize your game and not use your focus ability which is like telling you some helpful hints and collectable locations.  Other settings that you can adjust are the ability to be detected, take damage and not be able to knock anybody out or kill anyone.  If you are spotted or knock someone out, you have to restart the last checkpoint.  Also with these settings, you won't be able to equip lethal arrows so they can be sold off for money.  All of these setting can be adjusted by turning them on or off but its all up to you.  My first playthrough was 25 hours with custom settings and it was very challenging.

My second playthrough was 16 hours which was collectables and challenges which are other achievements.  Each mission you are given secondary objectives such as getting headshots with arrows, don't be detected, collect all the loot, don't take damage, and don't kill anybody, pickpocket enemies and so forth.  If you complete these, you will be given extra money at the end of the mission.

What to do with all of the money that you earn? You buy upgrades for you armor, Blackjack damage (club to knock people out), your Bow, Arrows, carrying capacities, more arrows, health and such.

This game is just like Deus Ex but without the options to pick the conversation responses and all the side missions are given by three people.

After playing the game for a couple hours, it became clear to me that most media site reviewers didn't spend more than an hour, maybe two, before lazily writing the game off, as they so often are won't to do with Sonic games for the past half-decade. This is painfully evident when you compare the cringe-inducing lack of comprehension or skill in their video reviews with gamers with actual ability and aptitude who have posted their own gameplay videos online. This is a new Modern Sonic, totally different from most 3-D Sonic games thus far, and it requires a lot more than squirrel-tier ADHD and a harsh deadline environment in order to get down the basics of the game. When you devote the time and energy to become acquainted with the new gameplay mechanics and level design, however, you'll find that Sonic Lost World is a modern Sonic gem. Sure, it has its flaws, but overall, it is approximately as good as the stellar&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-Colors/dp/B002I0IIPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic Colors</a>&nbsp;was for the Wii, at least in my opinion anyway. For the sake of actually giving the game a fair chance and being informative, this is going to be a long review, written by a lifelong Sonic fan for all the Sonic fans out there. Either buckle up or jump ship now, you've been warned.

The game begins with Sonic and Tails chasing Dr. Eggman (*sigh* I miss Robotnik) in the clouds, where they discover ""Lost Hex,"" a floating world that looks like Little Planet from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-CD/dp/B0009OGJ02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic CD</a>&nbsp;meets the fractured world from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-Unleashed/dp/B00178AT00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic Unleashed</a>, made from Hexagons. After being stranded on this world, a new group of villains called ""The Deadly Six"" take over Eggman's forces. This impels Sonic and Eggman to form a tentative partnership in order to stop the Deadly Six from destroying the world and that's all I'll say about the plot to avoid spoilers. The story in Sonic Lost World continues in the narrative tradition set by the lovely Sonic Colors and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-Generations/dp/B004X56PWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic Generations</a>. That been said, expect a plot that would stand out and shine in any Saturday morning lineup. The writing is truly funny and heartwarming, the cutscenes are well done, and the voice acting is top-notch. I genuinely loved every bit of the story in this game. As lighthearted as it tends to be, there are some surprisingly dark moments as well, for a Sonic game anyway. Seeing Eggman bicker with Sonic and Tails, taking jabs at each other while trying to work together, is an absolute joy. Most of the new Deadly Six villains are not nearly as likable or unique as the main characters, but all fit the role of cartoon villains well enough I guess. I must say, this is the most bad@$$ depiction of Eggman since Deem Bristow's Robotnik from the Adventure games. Awesome. As with most Sonic games in recent memory, the game opens and ends with a breathtaking CG cutscene that makes me yearn for a Pixar-esque Sonic movie.

Speaking of high-quality visuals, boy is this game gorgeous! Much like everything else in the game, the art design and graphics are clearly designed to emulate the classic Genesis titles. The levels are breathtakingly beautiful, full of vibrant colors and jaw-dropping vistas of Lost Hex. Each section of the game has unique themes with tons of variety within. Of course, this is a Sonic game, so there will be  levels reminiscent of Green Hill Zone, as well as levels themed on casino nights (complete with pinball machines), icecaps, mystical caves, and sugary delights. It's all a joy to take in. Character designs are also a delight, featuring many of the classic badniks that we've all known and loved from the Genesis days, complete with trapped flickies and other cute animals inside, as well as the more recent egg-pawns. What a joy it is to see those baddies make a return. The game runs very smoothly at 60 fps as well, which is a big boon in its favor. The sound design is equally nostalgic. Many old-school sound effects make a return that adds up to the classical mood of the game overall. Best of all is the delicious soundtrack. Sonic games always have noteworthy soundtracks, but this one is incredibly good. The tunes are varied, catchy, and all are equally superb. Some tracks even sound like the beautiful, uplifting music from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NiGHTS/dp/B00002STUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NiGHTS</a>&nbsp;series. I could listen to Tropical Coast Zone 3/Lava Mountain Zone 2 all day long; what a breathtakingly beautiful song! This game has stupendous visuals and audio, for sure.

The biggest change to this game over Sonic's last installment is the gameplay. How does it work? Deliciously, for the most part. To be honest, I have never played a 3-D Sonic game that is as faithful to the 2-D Genesis classics in concept and execution as Sonic Lost World is. Seriously, I'm a lifetime fan of the blue blur.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-the-Hedgehog-2/dp/B00002ST7F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>&nbsp;was my first ever video game and is still one of my all-time favorites, and ever since then I've been a huge fan of Sonic. SLW feels like the classic Genesis Sonic titles played from Sonic's perspective in a (mostly) 3-D style game (similar in concept to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-3D-Land-World/dp/B00DC7G0GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario 3D Land/World</a>). Much like recent Sonic games, however, there are plenty of 2-D sections as well that are just as fun.

Rather than being the ridiculously fast ""boost to win"" Sonic of the past several years, SLW is much more about acceleration and maintaining momentum through skillful platforming. Liberal, intelligent use of the spin dash is essential if you want to experience Sonic's trademark speed. Controlling Sonic himself actually feels akin to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-Adventure/dp/B00000K3X9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic Adventure</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/its-amazing-sequel/dp/B000059Z7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">its amazing sequel</a>, with more layers of complexity added in. Sonic can use a double jump similar to the one from Sonic Colors, but SLW does it much better in my opinion. There are two types of homing attacks. One is the more traditional homing attack, the other causes Sonic to punt an enemy into others to take them out. Pushing the L-stick by itself causes Sonic to break out in a leisurely jog similar in pace to Mario. Press the R-Trigger while moving and Sonic breaks into a good paced run. This R-Trigger also causes Sonic to perform parkour moves in certain contexts, such as near walls or up trees, etc. To be sure, this control scheme is rather complex, even for a Sonic game, and it will take a bit of time to get used to its intricacies and nuances. When you do so, you'll find the control mechanics are extremely pleasing to use. Chaining together a long line of rapid wall runs is super satisfying. Some sections feature Sonic running at break neck speeds. Believe it or not, these are a lot like the mach speed sections from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-06-shudders/dp/B000G0LE0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic 06 *shudders*</a>, but MUUUUCH better. In fact, they're very refined and ridiculously fun here.

These control mechanics are also complemented very well by levels that are, for the most part, extremely well-designed. I would go so far as to say this is some of the most thoughtful, insightful level design from Sonic Team in years, perhaps the best since Sonic Adventure 2. Much like Sonic's best classic games, levels are filled with multiple pathways that are designed to cater to players of almost any skill level and play style. Some paths may be for people who like to explore, others utilize Wisps (more on that in a bit), others are all about extreme parkouring, others are for newcomers to the series, etc. Many of the cylinder-like structures you traverse actually feature at least  two or three different types of pathways. Several Eggman capsules are in every level, waiting for Sonic to come and rescue the animals within (which you need to do to unlock later levels). Collectibles like red star rings are expertly hidden and super satisfying to acquire. Comparison to Super Mario Galaxy is understandable when you see the planetoid structures, but the way Sonic Team crafts them around Sonic's unique gameplay mechanics make SLW a wholly unique experience. Seriously, I am incredibly impressed by the aptitude of Sonic Team's level designers in this game. I'd even go as far as to say there's a subtle brilliance in the level design.

The game is a Wii-U exclusive, and as such, expect liberal use of the gamepad's special features. Some of it works fairly well, some not so well. Wisps return from Sonic Colors, and all feature some sort of motion/touch controls. Sometimes this is great. The orange rocket wisp, for example, feels much like the canon from recent Mario 3-D games, where you use the gyroscope to aim. This feels great. On the other hand, in order to use the Cyan light-speed wisp, you have to aim and flick your finger across the touch screen; the problem is, it just doesn't always work so well and it feels like a gimmick, to the point of distraction. SLW's status as a Wii-U showcase is a mixed bag, honestly. This is more of a core Sonic showcase in general, and I think that aspect should have received more focus from Sonic Team during development. Don't view this as a killer app for the Wii-U, just view it as a great new Sonic game.

Make no mistake, the core game of SLW is truly thrilling and a refreshing breath of fresh air, but it's not a perfect game. One thing I both love and loathe Sonic Team for sometimes is their insistence on throwing as many ideas into their games as possible, even when it's unnecessary and at the expense of refinement. I applaud the level of enthusiasm and creativity they poured into this game, but some ideas just don't work so well and result in a ridiculous amount of frustration. For example, there's an ice level where you have to roll Sonic around a death-trap obstacle course while encased in a giant snowball. The physics are wonky here and the level design can be downright cruel, resulting in frequent cheap deaths. Talk about infuriating. Some of the wisp powers feel unnecessary, with painfully shoehorned motion/touch elements that take attention away from the core game. I hate gimmicks like that. Sections where you have to bounce from super small trampoline clouds are annoying because of a bad combo of floaty controls and poor spatial awareness due to the camera. Other design choices are jarring for the franchise and poorly conceived. Collecting 100 rings no longer gets you an extra life. Are you kidding me Sonic Team? Why?! Also, much like Sonic Colors and Generations, there can be some brutal, I-want-to-chuck-the-gamepad-into-the-wall difficulty spikes at times, especially later in the game. While that isn't necessarily a massive flaw, things like this can add up and steal away the big doofy grin the rest of the game has given you. Undeniably, one of the most disappointing things about the game by far are the incredibly lame boss fights. You'd think with the name ""Deadly Six,"" there would be epic boss battles in SLW, but no. Many are anti-climatic because of how ridiculously easy they are, taking seconds... wait seconds? Yes, SECONDS, to beat. Even the bosses later in the game are a joke. Most of the bosses seem to be inspired by boss concepts from the Genesis titles, transposed into a 3-D game, which is a great idea, but the execution here leaves a lot to be desired. Some are genuinely thrilling and well designed, but for the most part, they're nowhere near the level of awesomeness that Sonic boss fights have been in recent years, sadly.

All things considered, Sonic Lost World is a great Sonic game, at least equal in quality to Sonic Colors. It may have its flaws and some of the game will infuriate you, but I find that for every moment that enrages me, there are four or five that slap a big doofy grin on my face. The game is beautiful and as a new modern Sonic platformer, it is a truly great start. I hope the jaded, cynical, and hypocritical reaction of the gaming press doesn't condemn this new formula for Sonic games into an early grave. If Sonic Team sticks to this formula in future installments, they could truly refine it to a level of perfection that could be as high-quality as Sonic's very best 3-D games. So don't be shy, and don't let many of the unprofessional ""professional"" reviews dissuade you from giving the game a chance. Much like The Wonderful 101, this is a game that rewards players for taking the time to learn the game and master its level layouts and gameplay mechanics. Every Sonic game has been like this. I guess the ""pro"" reviewers forgot that. If you're still not convinced, I implore you to look up footage of people who are decent at video games playing it online and try to tell me the game doesn't look fun and isn't at least worthy of your consideration. As for me, I'd definitely recommend this game to Sonic fans and Wii-U owners alike, and find it to be a solid 8/10: It's a great new direction for Sonic with room for improvement in (hopefully) future installments. Give it a try, and you may be surprised at just how much of a good time you'll have with Sonic in this Lost World.

*Update 12/29/13*

It appears Sonic Team was listening to fan feedback the last few weeks. I'm not exactly sure when, but Sega has released a patch for Sonic Lost World that actually corrects some of the poor design choices I originally cited as negatives for the game. Now, 100 rings DOES net you a 1-UP. Great! You also get ten lives after a game over instead of five. The difficulty many people have complained about is really not much of an issue anymore, as these changes make extra lives much more abundant. Even better, the new upgrade now makes it an option to control wisp powers via traditional button inputs instead of ONLY using some sort of gamepad gimmick, thank god! The game is now noticeably better because of these changes. They have also released FREE (for now anyway) DLC that lets you play through a few levels with a Yoshi's Epic Yarn theme as Sonic, complete with Shy Guys and everything! In the future, there will be another Nintendo DLC level or two, widely believed to be centered on the Zelda series. That. Is. Awesome. Can't wait. Because of the things I discussed in this upgrade, I increase my score from 8/10 to a 8.5/10. BOOM! I've noticed that Sonic Lost World has been pretty polarizing in the fanbase. Some fans love the game (I myself fall into that category), others hate it with a passion (for some reason). If you are still on the fence, there's a DEMO you can play of the game on the eshop, so you can see if it's for you or not before spending your money. I implore you guys to at least give the demo a shot. What have you got to lose? You may just end up liking the game.

4.0,True,"08 13, 2013",A20UU4506ECYTV,B000VOE466,Rich56,"The first thing I'll say about this keyboard is that the price is right! The board is very well made and laid out. I'm not a gamer but I do need, and use, hotkeys. The ""Smart Technology"" programming software that is offered with the item is relatively simple to use.

In fact, I'm a flight simulator hobbyist, (FSX and Prepar3D), with several thousand dollars of hardware and software invested. When I fly the aircraft that are controlled with yolks and throttle quadrants, I use the Saitek yoke and throttle system, (along with the Saitek switch panel, additional throttle quadrant, and rudder pedals), and use the Saitek SST programming system.

I mention this because I, for one, was afraid that the Cyborg V7 programming software and the Saitek flight system software would collide. But not so, they work together and I was able to use the Cyborg V7 keyboard's profile I had set up for the flight simulator alongside the custom Saitek Pro flight system profile for the same simulator with no conflicts.

Because there's plenty information regarding the more 'in depth' specifications of the board, (macro keys, key positions, etc.), broken down in detail in many of these reviews and manufacturer specifications, I'll just say that the motherboard fit comfortably on my slide-out keyboard shelf in my desk.

The keyboard is 21 inches wide, just under 8 inches deep, and stands about 2 3/8 inches high when the built-in, foldaway stand ups are used. The keys feel very good when pressed and the lighting of the keyboard is very nice. So why did I give it four stars?

Because for one, I have yet to figure out where I need to go to get the software, (or maybe it's the firmware), that I need in order to make much of the board's ""other"" options work! It may be that if I don't have a game installed other than the flight simulators, these other lights and controls will not operate.

But I don't know that for sure, and have read in several of the reviews that there is some form of special, hard to get software that you need to get those parts of it to work. Frankly, I just haven't had the time to hunt down these ""special"" software locations and I think Mad Catz could have included and or directed the buyer to this information with a bit more clarity.

But the big deal to me was first and foremost; the keyboards USB cord!

It is not detachable and I imagine at some point I'll have to buy a USB cable and solder it in place of the cable that's there now. I hate the Cyborg V7's cable because it has three additional cables coming from it that plug to the headphones, microphone, and for an additional pass-through USB port. NONE of them are removable and I'm sure it won't be much longer before I take my wire cutters out and just cut them off.

But that still leaves this big, heavy, 'junction block' in the way so I will be replacing the entire cord very soon I imagine. The other thing I didn't like about the board was the way the volume is controlled.

It's position on the upper left-hand corner of the board and it's not very sensitive. In fact, sometimes when you press it, it'll respond instantly and other times it'll take forever if it all to respond. Also it seems awkward in that position on the motherboard for a right-hander. When you try to reduce the volume using your right hand, you can't see the bar graph and frankly, I would rather see the volume level indicator pop up on the monitor the way that my previous Logitech keyboard would display it and then disappear automatically after a moment or two.

Overall, the board is a very good investment and as I said in the beginning, the price is great. I do recommend this motherboard for those of you who don't tend to pick things apart detail by detail. Personally, I don't see a perfect world and so I don't expect one. If you're looking for a good keyboard that's programmable to some extent, the Cyborg V7 I do recommend this board.

I was on psn and happened to run across a video about it (a month after it had already been released), I was impressed and thought it might be a pretty cool game so I decided to look on both Game stop.com and Amazon to see if the collectors and ultimate editions were still available for purchase. the ultimate edition wasn't available at Game stop.com and was waaaaaaay too expensive (ranging from $300.00-$400.00 new, a whole lot more than its original price) from Amazon and sellers on Amazon, the collectors edition however was available on both but surprisingly enough I found it new on Amazon for about $10.00 less than what Game stop was selling it for so I ordered it from Amazon with next day delivery.

The Game Boy player was no doubt intended to draw the masses to the waining Gamecube. The strategy was in how to use the popularity of the GBA handheld, to get consumers to also consider the Gamecube console. Nintendo actually had created a Super Game boy device for the Super Nintendo some years ago. So this is nothing original however, but is vastly improved upon from the previous device. Technically the Game Boy player is a literal Game Boy Advance system without the ability to load GBA carts on it's own. It has been manufactured to match the measurements of the Nintendo Gamecube exactly and is equipable to the Nintendo Gamecube's high speed port located directly below the machine. 4 bolts can be fastened down with a coin to secure the Game Boy player. The device adds just 1 inch in height to the Gamecube and is programmed to accept all regional Gameboy Advance games as well as most Game Boy color and original Game Boy games just like the original Game boy Advance handheld. This gives gamers greater than 1,000 options making it a very large library of games to play with. No batteries are required since the Game Boy player powers off of the Gamecube anyway meaning it becomes more cost efficient than the handhelds were. The Game Boy player accepts Game Boy cartridges near the bottom and has a sliding ejection switch located on the right side of the player, used for popping game carts out when desired. The player itself requires a boot disc found packaged with the device in it's own protective hard case. The disc is exactly the same size as a common Gamecube disc, (3 inches in diameter) and must be placed in the Gamecube along with the GBA cart being placed in the player, before powering on the system. Once on, the disc can be removed at will without the need for disrupting gameplay. In fact, players can opt to load a Gamecube disc into the Gamecube during gameplay, shut down the Gameboy player via a menu, and load up the gamecube disc all without ever actually turning off the console itself. The same action can be applied when gamers decide to play a different Game Boy game pak. So no need to reboot a second time unless you shut the system down. The Gameboy Player was designed to behave in most every way like an actual Game Boy Advance unit. It supports most Game Boy Advance accessories like the Nintendo E-Reader device which is used to scan cards. It can accept the Game Boy Advance Game link cable for multiplayer purposes though a second Game Boy Advance will still be required. You may access the cable link port right in the front of the Game Boy player device. Simply plug the game link cable to the Game Boy player port, then plug the other end of the cable right into a Game Boy Advance unit. Check your manuals for GBA titles that may require more than one game pak as well before attempting this of course! Actually the Game Boy player fully supports the Game Boy Advance wireless multiplayer adapter as well. Gamers can plug up a common Gamecube controller in port 1 or use the Game Boy Advance/Gamecube connectivity cable along with a Game Boy Advance or even a Gameboy Advance SP to serve as a controller. While the Gamecube controller is usable, the button layouts are unique given the complexity of the controller versus the simple button layout on the Game Boy units. Both the Y and X buttons found on the Gamecube controller for example, are mapped to the select button on a Game Boy unit. A menu option will allow the player to choose between a few different button control layouts with the Gamecube controller, though I have found it best to leave it as is. You get used to it believe me. The Analog stick will function along side with the directional pad on a controller as a character movement tool. pretty cool stuff. The Game Boy player has an options menu accessable with the tap of the Z button at any time during game play. Be warned however as this function will not pause actual game play. From here players may choose new button control schemes, toggle between normal and full screen views, play with a screen filter for richer picture during on screen action segments, even set an in game timer of up to 60 minutes, choose from over 20 different wallpaper views in normal screen mode, and are able to quit the current game. The game screen itself is roughly half the size of the actual TV screen, and is presented in a centrally located box complete with a decorative wallpaper hanging over the background. players have over 20 wallpaper options to choose from but if the wallpapers aren't for you, you can always stretch the image to full screen via the Game Boy player menu options. You'll loose some clarity however and the images on screen become a bit blurry. They still look nice however and it probably won't bother people too much once you get used to it. There is a screen filter option offering three levels of filtering; sharp, normal, and low. This option set on sharp will keep images looking crisp and nice while players are moving around on screen or during chaotic action sequences where there may be quite a bit going on on screen. this comes at the cost of frame rate and in some cases can drastically slow the game down. Actually this will never happen much as most games never have these lag issues on the Game Boy Advance anyways. Some people may NEVER incure these problems so it's really no problem at all. The timer is there just for fun. You can set it to count how long your playing in some games or use it to have the children share time on it...just to name a few a suggestions. The Game Boy player unfortunately will not work with the Nintendo Wii as the Wii lacks the high speed port found at the foot of the Gamecube. Besides, the size and shape of the player in comparison to the Wii would be impractical. There are also some minor cases where certain Game paks are found to not work right in the Game Boy player. Namely it's the unique titles that require certain conditions for gameplay to work properly. Games like Yoshi Topsy Turvy required players to tilt the game left to right to have the character move on the screen. You probably won't be in the mood for hefting the entire Gamecbue left and right all day as this might get a bit heavy LOL!There is the Boktai series on GBA as well which required solar energy for certain gameplay settings, meaning you'll need sunlight. Also there are a few GBA game garts with a unique shape to them. Considering that game carts are loaded at the bottom of the player, this would mean that the Gamecube would have to sit on top of the game pak to work. In this instance however, if you simply tilt the Gamecube part ways over a table surface so that the cart can lean over a ledge, you might remedy that issue entirely. These rather bizarre incompatibility issues are few and really nothing to worry over as most Game Boy games are played in the conventional since. An issue involving Game Boy Advance movie series game carts is also present. For copyright purposes, Nintendo disabled the Game Boy players' ability to view these special cartoon shorts. They feared that people could somehow burn copies of the toons from thier TV's. Also incompatible with the Game Boy player is the Game Boy Micro hand held. you can't use the Micro as a controller because it's ports for cable connections have been reworked for the purpose of ""proprietary conversion"" to a consumer product. So the Micro cannot connect with the GBA/Gamecube cables. If you purchase the Micro/GBA conversion cord from Nintendo's web site, you could use the Game Boy Micro as a second player in multiplayer titles by hooking the micro conversion cord into the GBA game link cable, then plugging THAT into the Game Boy player device. Having said all that, The Game Boy player DOES offer a unique rumble pak like enhancement using the Gamecube controller in select titles like Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga for example. Too bad only a hand full of games supported that feature though. The Game Boy player comes in jet black color only in the US. However, in Japan I here they had platinum, Indigo, and Spice colors to match the colored variety of Gamecubes respectively. (Japan has a Spice or yellow colored Gamecube also not found in the states) The Game Boy player was available for retail around 2003 and was priced at 50.00$ US currency. So if your looking into this item try and use this MSRP price as a basis to go on so you won't lose too much money on a bad deal... Game Boy player units have since been discontinued and are becoming increasingly harder to find as the years move along so I suggest quick action if the product really excites you.

PROS:

...Overall the Game Boy player really is a value and a pleasure to own and to play. The picture quality on your TV set looks very nice even at a seemingly disproportionate size. The ability to power itself off of the Gamecube means zero batteries. And that means this becomes very cost efficient if your still running your original Game Boy Advance unit. There are more options available to the gamer in regards to controller use with the Gamecube controller offering one more way to play your games. The ability to see everything without having to squint is obviously a welcome addition. Espescially true for text heavy titles like Final Fantasy and when it comes to people that have troubles seeing small text. I liked the way the Game Boy player allows you to switch between game carts and even into using the Gamecube on the fly a bit more easier than powering down the hand held all the time. Volume works on the TV speakers now rather than those tiny little things you spot on the GBA device too.

CONS:
It limits use of some unique games due to the shape of the cart or certain gameplay factors like requiring solar energy or motion sensitive titles. Some games really look terrible on your TV and it's not the Game Boy player's fault! The programmers sometimes don't pay attention to detail work and boy does it ever show up on a TV set! Game Boy Advance sound is enhanced on the TV because of the speakers. But it's overall quality is lackluster in many titles. This is apparently true on older Game Boy or Game Boy clor titles where all those bleeps and blurbs will drive you batty. Some folk will find it annoying to say the least. Game Boy movie carts are a no no on the device due to fear of some happy hacking rascals out there. [RANT ON] Really, who the heck wants to steal RUGRATS or FAIRLY ODD PARENTS cartoons? And don't they understand hackers are likely going to just rip off DVD versions anyways? HERE'S YOUR SIGN! [RANT OFF]

OVERALL:
Realistically this product is worth the price of admission. It retailed cheaper than a Game Boy unit and yet functions just as well as one in most respects. It's hard to knock this stellar product even if it were Nintendo's way of wanting you to maybe think about it's Gamecube too in that cheesy little way. A word to the wise... this device works best on 32 inch TV's or below. Anything bigger and the picture gets a little uglier than some may be able to deal with. It never gets too bad though. It's easy to afford, install, and use. If you own a Gamecube that your shelfing due to the Wii console here's one good reason to shine up the cube and keep it around a bit longer. Even if you own multiple game boy units or the DS, The Game Boy player still holds it's own as a unique experience. And I doubt the Wii will ever recreate another similar device. All said and done I have to recommend this device, it's really worth it.",The Game Boy without the Batteries,1174953600,7,,

You can interact with the animals, put on demonstrations and drive a buggy! The graphics... oh my gosh!!!! We just love this game.

The only downfall is that there is a limit on your zoo. You have to figure out how to keep building it up and leveling up while staying under your space limit. I hope that they take this off but they probably wont. The other thing that I see a lot of people complaining about is because of the limit they cant put many animals or they are having to trade some animals off in order to get others. My thinking is, REAL zoos are always trading, buying, selling or releasing animals. That is how they grow and get other animals.

This is not really a game for young children unless you help them maintain the zoo. There are challenges and things you have to do to maintain your zoo and keep visitors happy. Once you have the zoo built and everyone (including the animals) are happy, then there isn't much to keep up on and you have play with the animals. The game is about maintaining and owning a zoo. Basically having a business. So, just make sure that you check your ratings and keep everyone happy! You will love it, there is no doubt about that!

If you're as bad a shot as I was in the arcade, you'll make up the money in about 10 minutes worth of play. :)

If you've never played the game but are looking for a new title to use your snazzy Wii Zapper on, then this is also the game for you. It's super responsive and accurate, and gives you lots of satisfaction based on the sound effects and gore.

For those expecting something new and fantastic for the Wii release, you may be disappointed. The graphics are the same as the tried and true versions, and the voice overs are still the very poorly-acted (but admittedly nostalgic) ones you love to hate.

Parents, fear not. You can ""censor"" the level of gore if you're still OK with your child playing this type of game. (It's rated M for mature, i.e. 17+). You can make the blood be green instead of red, and also minimize the amount of gore in the options menu. Accessory-wise, you don't need the Wii Zapper or other comparable shooting peripheral. It works fine with the controllers as they come out of the box, but since the arcade version had guns, it's nice to have this extra.

Here's what you get with the game: House of the Dead 2, with arcade and original modes, boss mode and training mode. You start with the basics, and as you get further and further into these modes, you unlock more and more things. House of the Dead 3 has arcade mode and extreme mode, with the same ability to unlock more and more as you go through the game.

The only minus for this game (which still doesn't affect my rating of it) is the occasional lag you may experience during zombie-intense shooting moments (maybe once or twice during an entire start-to-finish game). It doesn't affect game play, but I'm sure some of you avid gamers out there would find it very annoying.

Overall, getting 2 games in one for 30 bucks is a great deal, and I'm a very, very happy camper that my arcade fave has made a return for Wii.",Look Out Zombies! Get Ready for Total Annihilation!,1206144000,67,,

At the time, I was just introduced to Magic, The Gathering and this game was described to me as a mashup of Magic and Monopoly.  Well, after five years, this is one of the few video games that I would go back and play again.  In fact, I just dusted it off the shelf recently and had been playing it over the last few weeks.

The game is basically deck building followed by hours of playing against either AI or human multiplayer on a board.  Like Monopoly, you place creatures on locations on the board and when opponents land on your locations, they either pay you or fight your creatures.  Winner is the first to get to the castle with however many predetermined points needed to win.

There's some sort of story, but it's easily forgettable.  As others have pointed out, the graphics aren't awesome, the voices aren't the best.  It's definitely not a game to get if you want to be wowed by the latest technology and be immersed in the graphics and story.

However, if you like card games like Magic, this is probably a good variation on it.  The highlight is the varied gameplay.  Since you build your own deck, there's a whole lot of combinations of things you can do.

I'll be a first to admit that I at first only bought this game for Tetris. I didn't play Dr. Mario on the original NES but I knew that Tetris was down right ADDICTIVE!  So I was a little reluctant to play Dr. Mario. But when I did that was fun too and just as addictive.
First Dr. Mario.  The game shows Mario throwing pills in a jar and you must match the color up with the virus until three of the colors in a row are stacked up. Then the virus disappears.  Yep, that's all.  20 levels that you can select right away but the game goes on with no real ending either...just like Tetris.
Tetris, I'm sure many of you have played it before. Whoever thought that making lines could become so addictive? You just place your blocks down until you form a line and then voila the line disappears.  What was best about this game for me? THERE IS NO ENDING! You select up to nine levels and there is actually a level 10...and 11....and 12...and 13 etc. The second best part. If you ever lost in Tetris it was mostly YOUR fault not the games fault!  It's you who must find the proper place for the block. And please tell me I'm not crazy when I say this, but did anyone else look at tiles in buildings and form pieces from Tetris? Also, did you dream of these blocks falling too? Well, I did because the game was just something branded in my mind and it's really nice to see it released for the SNES.
Both of these games are great in another aspect. The fact that they're both simple.  Anyone could play these games and expect to have some sort of mastery at them.  I think a lot of video games are actually aimed at male players such as myself and a lot of female gamers can't get into them as easily. Well, this game is easy for anyone to get into.

First of all the details:
You get the wheel and foot controls and a long cord to connect it to the PS3
The Wheel is rumble compatible
The wheel IS Officially licensed by SCEA
The Pedals are analog, not digital, so I think they are more sensitive and realistic.

The Wheel has ALL the buttons you can think of, so if you don't want to use the pedals you don't need to.
Wheel Controls on Left side of wheel:
L3, L1, TRIANGLE, SQUARE, L2, SELECT, power indicator, and finally L2 also On Back paddle
Wheel Controls on Right side of wheel:
R3, R1, CIRCLE, X, R2, Programming LED, Start, and finally r2 also On Back paddle
In the center is the directional pad ( where the horn would be)

The Pedal control is L pedal = SQUARE R pedal = X

** the L Paddle, R Paddle, and L Pedal and R Pedal can be reprogrammed also! ***

Like I said you don't need the pedals if you aren't used to them or don't want to use them.

It is a nice size, and has a nice feel to it, nice a firm grip with suction cups,
OR you can strap it to your lEG with the included velcro strap and use it that way.. pretty cool!

It has a nice long cord. ( no it is not cordless which may be a reason why it is a bit cheaper, but who cares!)

Ok.. How does it work... GREAT! I tried it first with Grid, it is SO much better than my other wheel controllers.. I was drifting so much easier than before, and the demo-derby was a blast!

I then tried it with GT 5 and NASCAR 2011  and yep worked like a champ! I have to get used to the foot pedals, I think that is the same story with other new steering wheel users, I still rely on the hand controls.

I really can't think of a drawback on this.. OK.. it is not cordless.. there I though of one tiny thing.

As far as the single player experience goes, Blizzard has help up to their standard of both great story telling and fun game play. They've introduced hero units again, in the form of Sarah Kerrigan, much like the heroes of their Warcraft III game. I'm having a great time with it, and I think the company/developers have done a good job of balancing challenge with accessibility. I'll say I'm no where near a pro gamer, but I found the missions challenging while not being so difficult I get frustrated.

This expansion also introduces evolution changes the player can make to their units, both on the level of changing for each mission, and permanent change splices. As an example, you can evolve your zergling to have fast attack speed, fast movement, or another option, which you can change between each mission, and as a permanent change, you can choose between fast spawning 3 units-at-once zerglings or zerglings that can jump up cliffs. I really like this new feature.

Beginning, there is LOTS to collect and explore. So you will be very busy. As a fan of history, I like how in depth they went about ancient Japanese culture.

It looked really good on the PS3 while my cousin played it on the 360. She said the PS3 version was sharper, so yay me =). As for Lara, I like the new model, more because she is more realistic and believable. Thus, making her very beautiful despite being just polygons lol. I grew to like the characters and dialog, like something that could be written as a film (like Uncharted). I have not tried the multi yet because the single player is what i came for, and I have not been let down at all. The art direction, characters, gameplay dynamic, graphics, all go well in this game.

One look at the intro into this game and you will be absolutely stunned by the graphics. Finally something that can rival Crysis, and in my opinion, this game looks just a little bit better. The gameplay is incredibly smooth, the AI is very competent and the overall story/campaign experience has been very rewarding thus far (the voice overs are even good!). This is definitely not a kids game, the game is filled with horrible (but lovely) language, lots of blood etc... Anyways, single player is very fun, but nowadays, who buys a shooter for just the single player?

The multiplayer aspect of KZ2 is absolutely sensational. It's hard to describe, you really just have to play it to believe it. Once you adjust the controls a bit, and play a few hours, this game feels great! You start to unlock weapons, abilities, join a clan, get in some tournaments, get on the ranking boards, the whole experience is just a blast. It's the most fun I've had with a shooter since CoD4 (probably more fun). The multiplayer features quite a few maps with incredible thought and design and lots of objectives to achieve. The only negative thing I've heard is that the controls are ""sluggish""...that's because this game is supposed to make you feel heavy. Make you feel like you're actually lugging around armor, but once you get the feel for it, the controls are very tight.

5.0,True,"05 6, 2017",AXA12TVIINQ7H,B01CEFEMFW,SPoon,"What an awesome product from Logitech. Well built and designed splendidly. From the nice audible mouse clicks of its buttons to how light the mouse actually is this is a very well thought out product.

The mouse responds instantaneously on wireless as far as I can tell. On an older wireless Logitech mouse I had to click multiple times for the click to register. Not being attached to a wire also means more freedom. There is no unnecessary wire pull that may occur with a cord. You can use the mouse while tethered to reduce the response time, but wireless has worked perfectly for me so far. The cord is quite sturdy and has some heft to it. If you are using the mouse while tethered you may not want the wire to dangle as it can cause wire pull due to the heftiness of the cord.

The mouse has a matte finish which is a nice touch, but Logitech also decided to throw in some glossy pieces which is very susceptible to scratches and fingerprints. The DPI buttons, scroll wheel button, forward and backward buttons, and parts of the underside of the mouse utilizes glossy plastic. For a premium product I would expect a manufacturer to use premium materials through and through so the choice for Logitech to use such a material is a mystery to me. Especially on buttons that are frequency touched it is let down for an OCD person like myself. However, this is just a minor cosmetic problem and has no affect on the performance of the mouse itself.

The left and right mouse clicks have a very fulfilling feeling when pressed. It does not truly matter where you click these buttons as it registers just the same. The scroll wheel has a nice rubberized finish and provides a bit of grip while scrolling. Hyperscroll can be activated and disabled by pressing the button directly beneath it. The slower scroll provides a tactile feedback as it has a ""click"" with each subtle turn of the wheel. Under the scroll wheel button are the two DPI buttons for quick profile switching. For some the DPI buttons may be quite small, but for me the buttons worked as intended. You can have up to five different DPI profiles. The profile you are using is indicated by the light bars directly beneath the buttons.

Although the DPI on this mouse have a rating of 12,000 I have yet to come anywhere remotely close to that figure. At about 3,000 DPI the mouse can easily zip from the left to the right of my 4K display with little effort. You can adjust the DPI for more precision or speed at a finger's touch readily.

The mouse may be awkward to hold at first due to its size and ambidextrous design so it make take some time to adjust. The forward and backward buttons are placed a bit too high when I have my hand resting on the mouse. Depending on the size of your hands and how you grip the mouse this may or may not be the mouse for you. On a side note, the forward and backward buttons can be completely removed or added to one or both sides of the mouse. The buttons are magnetically attached so swapping the pieces out are easily done.

On the bottom of the mouse, dust can easily get caught along the edges of the glide stickers so cleaning it regularly is a must. The matte finish on the majority of the mouse also provides a nice resistance to fingerprint and sweat.

The programmable RGB indicators are also a nice addition. Keep in mind if you are connected wirelessly with the lighting on you will get up to 24 hours of battery life compared to 32 hours with the lights off. There is a power switch on the bottom of the mouse so do not forget to turn off the mouse when not in use.

Overall, I really enjoy the looks and feel of this Logitech product. Price may seem a bit excessive, but having something I enjoy using on a day to day basis may outweigh the cost. This mouse may not be for everyone so I recommend giving it a test drive before purchasing. If you do decide to purchase this mouse you will not believe how light this mouse actually is. I can lift and readjust the mouse with little effort.

The packaging is also worth mentioning as it should with a premium product. Logitech has designed the perfect box for presenting such a premium device. Side the top cover off and you are presented with a box. Open the box like a piece of jewelry and basting in all its glory is your precious new mouse. What a sight to behold.","Mouse with a few cosmetic flaws, but offers awesome performance and design.",1494028800,,,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X3yFY8psL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61bRkDUscaL._SY88.jpg']"

And by this point we already know that CD Projekt Red knows how to deliver on their RPGs.  The Witcher is a huge game that takes about 37 hours to beat the main story and over 150 hours to 100% complete the game.  We're going over the highlights.  Let's take a closer look at the Witcher 3 and how this game stands out from the crowd in this quick review.

The Witcher 3 is a very in depth RPG that's easy to pick up and hard to master.  The tutorial is very step by step and explains all of the complex mechanics that allow you to play the game properly.  But at the same time, it's intuitive.  Even during the first few moments, the game flows well.  From the first hour of the game the story teaches you basic combat and introduces you to the open world.  Objectives are very directed and easy to get to on your horse.  All of these features make the game seamless and that's what makes the Witcher 3 so amazing.  It never takes you out of the gameplay.  You rarely find yourself stuck whether it's due to the lack of directive, the story, or the challenge.  That's why it's one of the game that you can't put down.

The story and the world of Witcher is continually pushing the boundaries of immersion.  The Witcher's story is complex, ongoing, and properly woven into the gameplay.  Each cutscene and each mission is very specifically directed and evokes emotion.  The way people react to your character, Geralt,  gets you lost in the story.  You really feel for Geralt and his troubles as being a Witcher.  It's the battle of every hero.  He's got great power, but a lot of responsibility.  People demand him to do dirty work for them, but see him as an outcast and a killer.  And of course Geralt has always been a ladies man, and his romance scenes are a story of their own.  Even conversation trees keep you on your toes and expose the true emotions of the characters.  It's not the type of game where you put your controller down during a cutscene.

The graphics in Witcher 3, especially on the PC version, are really top notch.  And it's not just about how many effects it's pushing.  It's the way it's used.  The day/night cycle is the most detailed out of any game.  It literally tells you the time and weather condition in the upper right corner.  And the weather gradually changes from cloudy to rainy to sunny again.  Looking up at the sky, you get lost in how attractive it looks.  Traveling through the world, it really feels alive.  Not just in towns, but even between towns.  On the roads there are small homes, traveling soldiers, and many areas to explore.  It contributes to the seamless nature of The Witcher 3.  Nothing feels like filler.

The combat in Witcher 3 is straight up fun.  Who doesn't like swinging a big sword in melee combat?  You engage in close quarter melee combat as well as fighting huge creatures.  You also have spells and potions to modify your attributes.

CD Projekt Red is also one of the most honest game devs.  The PC version has no DRM if you purchase on GOG.com.  And they are one of the few publisher who will release a high amount of free DLC.

The Witcher 3 is a massive game with high ambitions and it gets almost all of them right.  It's beautiful to look at, it's fun to play and it's accessible to almost anyone.  Unless you are highly averse to RPGs, you definitely want to pick up the Witcher 3 and start slayin!

But it really feels like this lasts longer than the original one in my New 3DS XL when it was new. I know for certain it will last longer in the solid red light state before the red light starts to blink. My old battery was at the point I was getting about 2-3 hours per charge, and it would go straight from blue light to blinking red light and then turn off in under a minute. With this battery (which was very easy to replace), I'm able to play for much longer and I have longer before I have to charge it. That's all I need, and at the price, I couldn't be happier with this battery.","If you need it, then buy it. There's nothing to think about!",1499472000,3,,

The 2 character system isn't bad at all, with the new characters in the game (plus 4 hidden characters), I think 9 more characters total than in Mario Kart 64.  At first you start with 3 grand prix, 4 races per grand prix, but you can unlock another one early in the game, and then a second one with a twist, as well.

Took the chance anyways and boy am I glad. I'm simply loving this game! I dunno why people rated this so poorly. The controls handle smoothly, the game looks great and supports widescreen, the story is awesome, the cast is cool, it's packed with above average speed action. I'm having fun all the way through. I've seen alot of new school cats who don't know about their gaming roots talk about how they messed it up by not making it a first person shooter. Oh please lol. I've been playing Metroid since the NES and let me tell ya, it was NEVER a FPS. Metroid was a 2D side-scroller. Only the Prime series adopted this FPS crap and to me, it ruined the game if anything. Anyone who knows where Metroid came from would love this game. You other guys should stick to Call of Duty. Don't get me wrong, I've played the Primes and it's good, but don't talk like that was Metroid's style. They've gone back to 3rd person gameplay and thank god! That FPS stuff doesn't appeal to everyone, they just made the game the way it was suppose to be originally. They even added in some FPS action into the mix which feels great. I've missed seeing Samus' entire body as she sprints and flips, dodges and battles. Prime pretty much destroyed that but it's back and it's better than ever!

Another thing people have a problem with is the fact that this game actually has a story line lol. C'mon, seriously? They believe that Samus should just be this dark mysterious mute without a past, present or future as long as she's blowing stuff up. Again with the Call of Duty mind set. Samus isn't a robot, she's a girl in a suit for crying out loud. A GIRL. If you don't expect some sort of tenderness or frailness underneath that mask, you're in the wrong room. Go make a Rambo version of the game and play it instead. The story doesn't make her come across as a wuss, it just shows that even the toughest warriors are human just like everyone else, and have the same worries and problems. I'm very happy they shed light on Samus in this game. She never says it out loud, so she's still the strong silent type, they're just finally telling you what she's been thinking. She has more reason to pull the trigger in this game. Go out and get it people, it's a wonderful game, ESPECIALLY if you haven't played any Metroid game before, or haven't played any Metroid Primes to confuse your perception of what a Metroid game is.","Don't Get Swept Up In All The Negativity, It Rocks.",1331510400,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It was like NOTHING else and it was brilliant. When the first sequel came out multiplatform (PS3 and PC got it same day as 360) I was there Day One as well. I watched as newcomer PS3 fanboys that had been trashing the game/series/license jumped on and some that claimed to have hated the first said they now loved it. Many others said it was too confusing and boring (obviously they hadn't played the first one so they were lost and rightfully so- BioWare had their hand forced by their new masters- EA) The sales were very low on ME2 on the PS3 because of the lack of the first Mass Effect. but at least they had something.

I say ALL that because we're talking about ME3- the final chapter in a trilogy. If you want to experience, TRULY experience the ME series- buy it on Xbox 360 or PC. It's the only way to fully grasp the magnitude of the game. There is not only nothing wrong with the ME3 ending, but I thought it was truly brilliant. When I see the level of anger and low ratings on the stars here- it makes me furious. Any PS3 gamers or 'just coming in' 360 or PC gamers shouldn't be allowed to complain about a 3rd game in a trilogy they didn't play all the way through. And I'd say that you new buyers that read this- Don't Start Here. Buy ME1, beat it, then 2, beat it, then 3... beat it. It makes all the difference in the galaxy.

And as for that ending that is so mixed up in the so called community. It's very thought invoking. There aren't monster explosions. There aren't fireworks. This makes it somehow NOT for kiddies, and that makes it bad??? it's a great ending. If you're a reader- especially if you've read the ME books- you'll really love the ending as much as I did. It makes you think. It makes you earn it and it's worth every second of it (and every praise the media has given it). These angry kids or just plain ignorant adults acting like kids, shouldn't be a reason to miss out on this amazing game.

If you have Kinect- you'll love it with this game. It adds a whole new level of fun to the game. If you don't have Kinect- think about it. If you can pick up the Col.

The game is easy to pick up and play and the story is very well told and easy to follow. The gameplay is familiar to anybody who has played 3D adventure games, and the overall quality and polish is just great.

And to top it all, the game is FREE. Yes, it's free, and brand new, sealed with the original PlayStation seal, you only pay for the shipping, which is [...]. I'm not kidding. My guess is that people were too busy with the PlayStation 2 and other consoles back in 2002 to give PlayStation games any attention anymore, so there are so many new copies of this game they're just giving them away.

Controls:
Typical Resident Evil. For new RE players, a learning curve is involved, but fans will be well used to the layout.
Visuals:
Breathtaking cut-scenes and character movements. It stays in league with the RE remake and also expands in certain ways. Japanese model & singer Ayumi Hamasaki modeled for the character of Rebecca, so anyone familiar with her will know the charater is gorgeous.
Gameplay:
Typical RE gameplay, search, explore, unlock puzzles. I'm not going to go into great length on this review simply because most of us know what to expect by now.
Gameplay II:
The buddy system is like a double-edged sword. It's clever to add the new aspect to the game which helps in tough spots. You can have a character explore one part of the passenger train and the Umbrella Research & Training facility while the other explores another area. Team the two up (Rebecca Chambers and escaped convict Billy Coen) and you've got double firepower to take down the various creatures (both new ones & old ones, some of the newer are very interesting.) Certain situations will leave one character needing the help of the other, i.e. trapped in a room and the only way to get out is to have the other character solve the problem.
Sound:
One of the creepiest sound settings in RE history. Turn out the lights, put the headphones on, and play away. Every movement, natural sound, and haunting music was placed into the game.
Overall:
A great new prequel to the Resident Evil series. With RE 2, Nemesis, and Code: Veronica due out in 2003 for GameCube, the series will live on. Don't forget, the all new continuation Resident Evil 4 is due in 2003 as well.

I first played this game on an emulator, and it was the fan-translation. I absolutely loved it, and I wanted to purchase a copy of the game because it was so great. I have no regrets whatsoever. The English voice acting isn't quite the best (and it's kind of humorous at times, too), and the Japanese sounds as though there's a lot more emotion to it (or in my opinion). There are a few translations that were changed (some of them were really awesome, some not so much. I really miss xxx's: ""Do I smell homo? Are you two lesbians?"" part during one of the investigations. Or how Hifumi was originally the ""Otaku,"" and here, he's the ""Fanfic Creator."" Otaku was much more suiting, due to his... Rather creepy... Behavior.)
Anyway, as for the story, if you're looking into buying Dangan Ronpa, but you don't know much about it. You play as Makoto Naegi, a pretty ordinary kid. He's just got invited to a super-prestigious highschool, where only the best of the best may be. Everyone in this school has a super-duper high school talent (or, in this case, they're an Ultimate), and they all seem like your average high school kid. Most of them come well-equipped with impatience, a foul-mouth, a short temper, an ego... Some of them are rather ditzy, or they're shy, and so on. These kids enter the school, find each other under strange circumstances, and then discover they have two options: They can commit the perfect murder and be granted freedom, all the while their friends/classmates accept a cruel punishment... Or, they can live their lives peacefully within the academy.
Some of them are reluctant to believe their circumstances, others start making use of themselves by exploring and trying to find anything out that they can. Things seem really peaceful and normal for awhile, and then the next thing you know, drama starts, all because of that little teddy bear. You would think the little fella is pretty cute, right? Yeah, no, complete psycho, even worse, they try to persuade everyone to commit murder by means of personal connections, envy, greed, fear, and all of that jazz. You wouldn't believe who is behind all of it, either.

I'll admit, there are some grammatical errors in the English dub of the game (""But whatever they used to killer her...""), but they really don't affect all too much.

As for the game quality, I purchased it used, and it came through as though it were new! How spiffy, right? But yeah. This isn't a game that can be finished too quickly. If you want a really nice, complex story, with nicely detailed characters, p funny antics, despair, and a broken heart, here's a good game for you.",Still a favourite.,1397952000,2,,

Over the years, they've gotten progressively better, culminating in Double Agent, which I truly thought would be the absolute best entry in the series.  Then came Conviction.  Conviction is not necessarily better than Double Agent, rather it's different.  Double Agent gave you the feeling that you were, well, a secret double agent.  Conviction has more of a Bourne Identity feel to it.  It has more of an emphasis on hand to hand combat and rewards you with instant kills or ""executions"" when you take someone out at close range.  This also in emphasized while interrogating enemies.  Sam Fisher basically beats the crap out them until they talk...and it's very fun!  Stealth is still the name of the game and there are a couple of missions that are instantly lost if you are spotted.  So, this game doesn't completely veer from what Splinter Cell is about.  The bottom line is that it's a fun game to play.  Sam Fisher makes you feel like a bad ass and you'll have a great time showing your enemies that you are just that.  Oh, and did I mention that the story line is great?  The story line is great.

PROS
 - Great graphics
 - Great voice acting
 - Great sound
 - Great controls
 - Balanced difficulty
 - Good replay value (just based on how much fun the game is!)

CONS
 - Enemies - particularly those who are aware of your presence and are actively searching for you - tend to repeat themselves over and over again, which gets a little annoying.  ""I know you're here somewhere, Fisher!  Are you too scared to face me??"" gets old after the doucher asks it 10 times.

Although the dialog is basically the same, the cut scenes and stages are different.  I'm glad I own and have played through both versions as the challenge is different for each version.

Based on my experience, I give the nod to the Wii version as the ""better"" verion, mostly because it's fun to use the Wii-mote to fight the ghosts (which I found to be more interactive than using the X-Box controller) and because you can play with two players in the Wii version.  This allowed my wife and I to play together, which was a blast.  It is still scary at certain parts even though it is more cartoonish than the highly detailed X-Box version.  Either way, if you like Ghostbusters, this is an extremely fun game.

If you come in expecting it to be like the ""old"" Most Wanted, then you need to do more research.  There were plenty of reviews and interviews about this game that should have made it clear what it was.

This game is basically about speed and having fun driving unrealistically.  If you are looking for a sim or a game where you can mod the slope of the carbon fiber hood and test it in a wind tunnel, then you will be disappointed.

Fantastic game, this is.  It would have been worth the original 60 dollar price tag but I got it on Black Friday for 25 bones.

UPDATE 12/3/12

I've heard a lot of people complain about rubber band AI in this game.  I haven't noticed this problem.  As a matter of fact, I was far ahead of the pack last night and crashed within sight of the Finish line.  I stil won the race by a comfortable margin.  Burnout Revenge, also a Criterion game, had bad rubber band AI but I really don't see it in this game.

People have complained about the police constantly being a problem.  I find that I actually like the fact that I have to be a tad more careful driving around town, makes it a little more challenging.  They're really no worse than something like GTA where they will come after you if they see you hit somebody, blow a toll booth, etc.  I've found that they don't bother with me unless I hit them or pass them going more than 100.

I've heard someone complain that they couldn't figure out what to do in multiplayer.  This might be a valid complaint, it is hard for me to judge since I am so familar with Burnout Paradise.  You are given challenges and depending on who you are playing with, it can be hard to complete them.  The mini map is clearly marked and there are giant signs that say ""meet up here"" ""starting line"" and ""jump over"" so really you should be able to figure it out.  Also, unlike Burnout Paradsise, the challenge does not abort if someone quits multiplayer.  I can't tell you how many barrel rolls I performed through the concrete pipe in vain on BP because somebody decided to bail.  Another difference from BP is that when a challenge starts in multiplayer in this game, it will eventually relocate everyone to the starting line.  In BP, you could start all the challenges you wanted but some idiots would just drive around and ignore them.",Burnout Paradise and Hot Pursuit had a baby!,1354320000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

You take control of the action like in a regular RPG, but there is no world map and you have to go where the story has taken you.  There is all the usual stuff with building up characters' stats and abilities, using items, save points, etc.  I usually don't like RPGs that tend towards movies because I favour traditional RPGs.  But this game is an exception.  The story is so intriguing and the graphics so nice.  I am a huge sci-fi fan, so I love playing the game.  It's like an interactive sci-fi novel.  Lots of fun.

I found the battle system fun.  Lots of characters can switch to the robot (like using a Guardian Spirit in FF8).  I think this was meant for boss battles.  The story is very extensive.  You can go into the database and pull up loads of info on keywords mentioned during the plot.  I felt 'immersed in the gaming experience'.  You can also take your time and explore every nook and cranny of the places.  There are secret rooms and hidden items.

A lot of the battles, regular or boss, can be really difficult.  I think that's to account for the enormous range of abilities the player's characters have.  They can switch to robots, use spells, and use tech attacks.  You can escape from any regular battle, and once you have died once to a regular or boss battle, you have a much better idea of what to do next time.

Another great feature is that you can pick and choose what special skills, spells, and attacks you want equipped in a certain area.  For example, if you are in an area with monsters that use poison, you can equip Poison Guard while you're in that area.  Another example would be if you are in an area with alien monsters, you can equip tech attacks
that are specifically meant to deal with aliens.

There is quite a bit of Christian religious imagery that is subtly woven into the storyline.  Haven't finished it yet, but I get the impression that everyone in the game universe is Christian.  One example is that the main character uses a phrase from the Bible as a computer password.  I actually found the combination of subtle Christianity with futuristic sci-fi to be intriguing.

Also, there was a scene that reminded me a lot of rape.  It was really difficult to watch.  Luckily , you can skip any scene by pausing the game and pushing the triangle button.",Excellent,1245888000,,,

(10)Plotline: Rahu, a being that ravaged the world a few hundred years ago is back.  Rahu evolves so he has 3 forms in the game.  When Rahu is defeated, the Z Sindicate take Rahu back to their hideout.  You apply for a bounty hunter job and go through all sorts of tournaments and jobs and finally raiding the Z Sindicate and destroying Rahu.(I tried not to give too much away about the story)

(9)Graphics:  They could have done more with the world graphics because the actions and characters are pretty crappy.  But  holosseum graphics are real good.  The holosseums are designed very well so there's a lot of cover.  The robos and explosions look great.

(10)Sound: For starters the music was great.  The sounds of all the guns bombs, pods, jumping, and explosions were great too.  What more could be said?

(10)Control:  A to jump and you can press A again and again to jump or air dash depending on your robo, B to shoot your gun, R to shoot your bomb, L to launch your pods, Y can change your target(Two on two battles only) or exchange your current robo for another(Tag Battles only), and X to charge.

(10) Multiplayer:  Play any robo and choose any part that you unlocked in one player and do several game modes.  Battle Royales, Tag Battles, Head to Head battles, 2 on 1 Handicap Battles, and more.

Some weapons are good against players because players are unpredictable.  Play in all 50 levels(If you unlocked them).

(9)Glitches: A few glitches like chracters going through the floor when they get knocked out.

(9)Entertainment:  This game is great because you have a lot of variety.  It's not like those games where you face a lot of the same enemies over again.  You face no one combination twice.  You might face people with the same gun or robo but they'll still be using other parts.  You always have to change your strategy if you're facing a new robo.

(10)Replay Value:  I've beaten the story mode at least 25 times and if you beat it you get arcade mode and Grand Battle.  Grand Battle is part of the one player and each place has a tournament or several tournaments including all the places in the outside world.  To beat a tournament you have to get one of three trophies but sometimes you have to get a certain trophy for most of the places to get a new tournament.  After a battle, you will be rated from your health, time, if you used illegal parts, how many robos you defeated, and etc.  You get points when you're rated and your points will be added up to determine if you win a trophy or not.  Arcade is where you face 8 robos in a row and you can change your parts through it.

Right away I noticed the game has probably the best sounds of combat I have ever heard in a game.  From the sounds of weapons firing to the sounds of armored vehicles running, the game is great to listen to.  The sounds of mortar shells coming down and exploding around you is just unbelievable.  When I walk through forests and fields, I can actually hear the sounds of birds chirping, dogs barking, and cows mooing.

  The graphics in the game are just great too.  I love looking at the water in streams and rivers.  It looks very real.  The forests and villages in this Eastern European setting are really beautiful to look at in this game.

I like how you can jump in different vehicles to drive around in and there is a car radio in the vehicle to listen to while you are driving around.  There are several different radio stations to listen to.  I love the music in this game.

The AI in this game is pretty smart.  When enemy soldiers see me, they immediately run and hide behind something.  They have try to out flank me and they have tried to sneaked behind me a few times. I love the part where a enemy soldier runs into a building to hide from you and you can use your weapon to blow a good size hole into a building to waste the enemy soldier. It is also so much fun to just take your weapon and shoot down all the trees that enemy soldiers are hiding behind.  You can do so much damage to the terrain with your weapons in this game.

The maps to this game are huge.  The maps are ten times bigger than the maps to Call of Duty 4.  I love the sandbox settings to this game where you can go any where on the maps.

5.0,False,"07 6, 2008",A26ZHZTAGP81BL,B000FQ2D5E,Wagnbat,"IGN gave Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots, a perfect 10.

The only other game on either platform to earn a perfect 10, has been Grand Theft Auto 4, which also came out recently.

So that puts PS3 and 2 perfect 10 games, and the Xbox 360 at 1... With the 360 having the same perfect 10 game as the PS3, so the PS3 is truly 1 up. But if you go to the next tier down, scores of 9+, the story changes. Xbox has nearly 50% more 9+ games which results in??? A more quality gaming base maybe? Or is it just that 360 has so many games due to being launched nearly a year earlier, that they just have so many they have to have a few gems in there somewhere?

I think the latter is somewhat correct. But GTA4 and MGS4 are perfect 10s? Ya, I think so. I played GTA4 on the 360, and had a blast. Very good storyline, tons to do, and it keeps you interested whether you're in it 24/7 or just a couple hours a week. The same goes for MGS4. I had to put it down for a few days, but when I picked it back up I was immediately immersed in the storyline which I'd forgotten back to MGS1... But they did an awesome job of reminding me of the key points I forgot, which was extremely helpful in getting caught back up... Especially since I pretty much skipped MGS3.

Now the question to me is... Now that I've seen some of the power of the PS3 tapped in MGS4, with character textures, eyes, and facial expressions that look absolutely a-fricken-mazing, combined with a very very solid in depth storyline, combined with deeply immersing gameplay... Is GTA4 really a perfect 10? Am I comparing apples and oranges? I think I am. They are two very different games, with two very different goals. But I think that MGS4 is made so well, that when put next to GTA4, people who've played both would seriously have to consider which to play. I think the only thing MGS4 really has over GTA4, is polish.

Is it the PS3? Or is it just attention to detail? I think it's Blu-Ray. I don't think the same level of graphical candy can be attained with the 360. Not because it's a weaker machine... But because I'd be willing to wager the visual texture files in MGS4 probably take up two or three DVDs worth of information. There is so much data, you even have to wait 2-8 minutes between some acts for the new data to load to the hard drive. I like this. This prevents loading/lagging between scenes, cutscenes, and storylines. Very very smart Konami's behalf.

The only disappointment... at least for others... is the ending is kind of anticlimactic. How so? If you played GoW1 you know the final ""boss"" was pretty darned tough. The last thing you beat in Gears2 is relatively easy. The boss before that is tough, but nothing close to the first game's.

There are also a few old characters that could have made it into this one like the Berserkers.

None of that necessarily makes the game any less awesomerest. Just things that could have done that would have added to it.

I must admit I was a bit skeptical when I first heard about this system.  A system with two screens and touch-screen interaction.  It seemed a little gimmicky.  (Anyone remember the ill-fated Virtual Boy?)  Rest assured, however, that this system delivers in every area important to the enjoyment of the gaming world.

The first thing on everyones minds is the controls; do they really work?  Well, in short, yes.  They are a bit awkward at first, but work remarkably well with a little practice.  Take Mario 64 DS for example.  There are three methods of control.  The first is using the control pad which isn't particularly effective, but recall that the original game was played with an analog control stick.  The second and most effective way is to slide the included thumbpad over your thumb and move it around the touchscreen.  The point where you put it on the screen is considered the ""center"" of control.  Sliding it away from the center of control simulates using an analog stick.  The only complaint here is that it's a bit awkward with no actual stick to provide resistance, but it still works remarkably well.  The third way which is also useful is a ""dual-hand"" mode.  It allows use of the stylus (pen-like apparatus) with either hand for movement.  You can then use the A,B,X, and Y buttons or the control pad (which functions as the A,B,X, and Y buttons for lefties).  Definitely different but fully functional.  Overall the controls for all the games I have played work very well with a few minutes of practice.

The graphics on this system are superb.  Mario 64 DS looks much better than its original counterpart.  It's a 96 bit system so it falls halfway between between the N64 and Gamecube, but do bear in mind that it IS a portable!  A+ all the way here.

The sound on the system is simulated surround sound.  It is very clear and crisp and really doesn't sound ""tinny"" at all.  You can even tell if something is coming up behind you.  No complaints here.

The system overall is lightweight and durable.  It comes with an internal rechargeable battery and an adapter to charge it with.  The battery life seems to be about 8-10 hours depending on what you're doing.  It takes 3-4 hours to fully charge.  It has two fully backlit screens so you won't have any trouble seeing the action.  (Play Castlevania: Circle of the moon on a GBA and then on this and you will see what I mean!)  It has fully wireless multiplayer capabilities and in most cases it only requires one game for the entire group! (VERY COOL)  My only minor gripe here is the size of the game cards.  They are about half the size and thickness of a GBA cartridge so if you ever misplaced it...

Other things worth noting are that it is backwards compatible with Game Boy Advance games ONLY (not Game Boy or Game Boy Color!).  It only plays single player mode (DARN!) on these games and is not compatible with the Game Boy to Gamecube link cable either.

The possibilities of the touch screen are almost limitless.  Imagine playing a basketball game and touching a player to pass him the ball or anything else your mind can imagine.  In my humble opinion we will see some very creative and ingenius uses of this screen in the future.  As a whole the DS has breathed new life into a gaming world that has gone a little stale.  It has given games a new direction in which to grow and evolve and a whole new way to experience a favorite pasttime.

5.0,False,"10 27, 2015",A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00X87BLK0,Bella,"If there's one thing I'm almost always up for, it's trash-talking Assassin's Creed. That sounds a bit bitter and vindictive, sure, but we're talking about a series built on broken promises and unfulfilled potential, yet one that is perennially defended as ""innovative"" and ""educational,"" both of which it only is occasionally. Sure, there are some fantastic games in the series. I count Black Flag among the best open-world titles ever released, and Liberation has one of gaming's most interesting female protagonists. The first one, practically a retro game at this point, even holds a special place in my heart.

That said, the series almost ran itself into the ground last year with the release of Unity. To date, it is one of the most embarrassing, laughable pittances of a AAA game ever dropped onto the market, and it seemed that even some of the most diehard fans were put off by the abhorrent lack of quality displayed there. It would have been wise, then, to maybe nix the whole ""crank out a game every year"" thing and take some time to figure out what went wrong. But Ubisoft didn't have time for that. So here we are again, less than a year later, with Assassin's Creed Syndicate.

This time, though? I actually quite love it.

It isn't for lack of trying to go in with a healthy dose of cynicism, I can tell you that much. As awful as this sounds, part of me wanted another excuse to go on a tangent about Ubisoft, to rail against annual releases, to tear into the same-ness of AAA titles. Alas, I'll have to get my ya-ya's out about that elsewhere, because as it stands, Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a stellar video game, warts and all.

Even the narrative, one of the historically weakest parts of the franchise, tries some new hats on and took me by surprise. Yeah, we've got the Templar and Assassin conflict still waging, Abstergo still doing evil corporation things, a cocky male lead in the middle of it, so on, so forth. But this time, there's a welcome breath of fresh air in terms of narrative variety and depth. Twins Evie and Jacob Frye travel to London to carry on their father's legacy and take down the Templars, then find themselves forced to start a fearsome gang in order to topple the Templar-backed crime syndicate known as the Blighters, who practically govern all of the city and the surrounding territories.

This time around, however, there is a distinct lack of the old ""one person against the world"" hat that this series has historically loved. More so than even the heavily ensemble-based Black Flag, Syndicate's narrative is driven by a stellar cast of characters who are among the most memorable in a title this year. Aside from the compelling leads, the rogue's gallery of original characters and historical figures assembled here is a dynamite one, not to mention relatively diverse. It's a blast to blow up factories with a wise-cracking Charles Darwin, or to hijack a train with the aid of Ned Wynert, the franchise's first transgender character. From body types to genders to backgrounds, the only diversity checkbox left unchecked here is pretty much the racial one, and even then, it says more about the time period (Victorian London) than it does any racial prejudice on part of the developers. For Assassin's Creed to have more than gruff men and a few token sexy women comprising its roster is a welcome change from most of the past entries, and it's an exciting step in a more progressive direction for the franchise as a whole.

The effect this diverse and interesting cast has on the overall story is a positive one, and makes it into one of the more authentic, genuine entries in the series. With Unity, III, and pretty much any game with Altair or Ezio, we only got to see the emotional journeys of the protagonists, who were often presented as stoic moral pillars, and were typically as generic and flat as Sunbeam Bread. Here, we get to see Evie and Jacob butt heads. We get an insight into how the rest of the cast factors into the larger conspiracy of the plot. We get both an in-depth exploration of the time period and a glimpse into how this story fits into the grand scheme of the canon (there are several interesting callbacks to past games here.) And, on top of all that, we get some of the best bits of the whole ""future"" meta-narrative that have been in the series thus far, which actually present us with compelling, interesting modern-day characters that are easy to start caring about.

From a narrative standpoint, Syndicate is a definite high point for the franchise, and is of such a high quality that I genuinely hope Ubisoft can pull a hat trick and not start slumming it again next year.

Speaking of slumming it, that was probably my biggest fear for this game in terms of gameplay: an unwelcome repetition of old mechanics that grow stale after the first few hours. And, make no mistake, Syndicate does very little to rock the boat in terms of gameplay. This still controls and acts very much like what we expect from an Assassin's Creed game in 2015. Free-running, air assassinations, some novelty form of transportation (horse-drawn carriages here,) free-flowing combat, some ranged combat, yada yada yada.

That said? It works better here than it has in the past, and personally, I feel like it represents a honing of fundamentals for the franchise. Unity tried too much stuff and did it all horribly. Black Flag had an amazing world and great navigation mechanics hampered by some unpolished combat and finicky gunplay. Pretty much anything before those games had their own niggling little flaws too. Here, it feels like a developer has finally nailed what it takes to make this franchise work. Outside of the occasional ""why in the world would you jump off of that in that way"" issues, everything works like a dream here, especially the smooth and polished combat, and the fun, fast zipline mechanic. Navigating the world and beating down thugs, not to mention assassinating targets, works with barely any hang-ups.

Also, I must say it was wise for the more elaborate, Hitman-esque stealth assassinations from Unity to be retained here. There's a certain charm to navigating large arenas and discovering bonus, silly ways to take out targets. For instance, it's much more fun to pretend to be a corpse and kill a doctor in the middle of an operating theater than it is to just storm in, swords swinging, and take him out with brute force. Much more polished than they were in their initial introductions, these elaborate kills add a great deal of charm to the overall experience.

That charm is easier to enjoy in Syndicate, too, because the game doesn't perform like trash. Everything looks stunning, outside of some of my usual complaints of Ubisoft games (no dynamic reflections, questionable distance draw, etc.,) and runs at a respectable frame rate. No, it's definitely not 60 FPS (at least on consoles,) but with how much stuff is often going on at once in Syndicate, that's pretty acceptable. And considering that the last game operated at around 10-15 FPS for a month or two after its launch, it's a major improvement.

Insofar, I realize that a lot of my praise for Assassin's Creed Syndicate has sounded pretty backhanded, and I apologize for that. Overall, I really do think this is a pretty great game. It's not going to set the world on fire in terms of gameplay, no, nor does it really do much to stray from the patented ""Ubisoft Open-World Game"" progression mold. That said, it does all of that relatively rote stuff very, very well, and is paced in such a way that actually makes me feel motivated to not only progress through the story, but to go out of my way to do all the side activities, which are all engaging and entertaining in their own right. In other words, yeah, it's very much what we all expected in many respects, but done so well that I don't particularly mind.

What really sets this one apart is the little things. The ability to switch between Jacob and Evie. The excellent roster of characters. The engaging and memorable set-pieces. The in-depth upgrade system. The merciful lack of aggressive immersion-breakers like reminders for micro-transactions and companion apps. The overall atmosphere of Victorian London. All of these things add to a solid, if somewhat predictable, package, resulting in a game that is half ""pretty good,"" half ""astonishing.""

Assassin's Creed Syndicate represents a sort of compromise. It's still firmly rooted in its increasingly archaic systems of progression and navigation, yet shows a distinct willingness to try out a lot of new, polished mechanics that have managed to suck me in and keep wanting more. It's the best Assassin's Creed since Black Flag, and I daresay the second-best in the franchise next to that one.

Here's hoping Ubisoft keeps putting out games that work as well as this one. Or, you know. Work in general.

Hey, I needed to get that shot in somewhere.

Pros:
- A dynamic, immersive world.
- A roster of memorable characters.
- Stellar aesthetics and music.
- Solid gameplay that satisfies.

Cons:
- Still stubbornly rooted in series traditions.
- Feels very much like an ""Ubisoft Open World"" experience.
- Horse-drawn carriages are often more janky than fun.
- Has some pretty jarring glitches at times.

However, most internet connections in the US have slower speeds than this, so that's the bottleneck and going wired won't increase your speeds.

I lean toward games that are engaging, difficult (not unfairly so) and rewarding when you do accomplish something.  This game covers all three.

After starting the game, you find yourself without too much story or instruction, but don't worry.  Be sure to realize this is a steep initial learning curve and once you've played, I'd say about 5-10 hours, you'll really have the hang of things.  You die often & sometimes suddenly and will have to start over from the beginning of a stage, but each time you do die you learn something and, with dedication & adjustment to the way you approach that death, can generally get past that point without too much difficulty the next time.  Boss battles are epic and sometimes take a decent amount of time, so give yourself plenty of time to play through since there is no pause function.  Some people don't like this; I personally do since I find that it helps you immerse yourself in the game (or Boletaria, the name given to this fictional land).

In closing don't expect to breeze through this game.  If you are a casual gamer or don't prefer some of the nuances I mentioned, pass it up.  But if you enjoy some of the same things I do, I doubt you'll find a more enjoyable or rewarding game! :)",best game in a long while,1260489600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I found the single player dull, and very very short (about 4 hours if you have it on normal and take your time, 3 if you put it on easy and zip right through).  The local Multi-player is also pretty dull.  I would assume that the system link would be alright if you could get 4 XBoxes with a total of 5-8 people in a game, otherwise it's very boring.
If you have XBox Live though, it is an entirely different story.  Mech Assault is by far the BEST Live enabled game so far.  It experiences generally low amounts of lag, and is amazingly fun to play.
As always, there are some people who are out to ruin the game for everyone else by taking advantage of certain aspects of the game, such as the ability to shoot someone half way across the level with the most powerful weapon in the game, but you quickly learn how to avoid such people, especially with the use of your Friends list.
The Friends list allows you to easily find... well... friends!  You can add and delte people as time goes on so that you don't wind up with too many people with bad attitudes playing in your games.

These headphones are solid, and built like a tank. They feel as though they could survive a drop from a 3-story building. My guess is they will make it the few feet from your desk to the floor if necessary. Despite their impressive build quality, they are not overly heavy. Not featherweight, by any means, but not heavy.

The fit is outstanding. Perhaps the best I've seen on any gaming headphones. This is important to me, because it bugs me when my headphones shift around just because a pencil rolled off my desk and I reached over to grab it. The other reason is because (don't laugh) I have a large head. (Okay, even I laughed just then, so go ahead.) Seriously, my hat size is large, and medium is way too small. Because of this, most headphones, particularly the cheaper ones, which these are not, fit too tightly on my head. That death grip means they get hot and uncomfortable before they should, and pretty soon they are off my head and hanging on their little hanger, unused.

These headphones have a feature I haven't seen before, the ability to adjust how tightly they fit on your head. It is controlled by two sliders on the top of the headband, and is easy to adjust, even while wearing them. Why someone hasn't done this before is beyond me. Perhaps all the headphone designers have average-sized heads. I will say that there isn't a lot of difference between their top and bottom settings, though, so they aren't quite as good as they could be.

The ear pads are thick, soft, and comfortable. They do a great job at blocking outside noise. This is an area that most headphone makers seem to have focused on, and because of that, they've pretty much perfected it. These have another feature I haven't seen before, too. It is a way for eyeglass stems to comfortably slide under the cushions. Genius! I wear reading glasses while at the computer, so this is a problem for me and many others. The way it works is there is a little adjustment buried under the ear pad covers that pulls the cushion away a little, right where the stems would normally hit. It works well, but because the adjustment is under the covers, you won't want to change it back and forth. Something to be aware of if you only sometimes wear glasses or if you are sharing these with someone else. Overall, though, I'd say it is pretty much perfect. If you never wear glasses, you can leave the adjustment as-is and you'll never notice it is there. If you do use it, there will be a little gap where the eyeglass stems hit that you might notice, especially when not wearing glasses. It is only a small gap, though, so it is unlikely to be an issue either way.

The microphone is pretty typical, and does its job. This is one of those areas you only notice when there is a problem with it, and there isn't a problem with these. They use a flexible stem, which is superior to a solid arm because it is easier to adjust.

Sound quality overall is excellent. It isn't bass-heavy like a lot of current models, but it isn't too bright and fatiguing, either. A very nice neutral, which makes vocals particularly clear. No complaints on that at all.

Price. Well, this is something that is very subjective, as how much they are worth really depends on a lot of personal factors like how important the fit, finish, and sound quality is to you. This model hits it out of the park on all three, but there is a cost for that. In my opinion, they are reasonably priced for what they are. Not inexpensive, by any means, but also not overpriced. If you can afford them, they are worth the money you will pay.

Recommended.

5.0,False,"03 29, 2015",AHL35XZ3OND2Z,B00KVR4HEC,Amazon Customer,"If you are curious about Bloodborne and think all the talk about combat may be your thing, think carefully.  Bloodborne is not a DmC game.  This is not a God of War game. There are absolutely some similarities superficially to DmC but ""timing"" in a From Software game is not the same thing as ""timing"" in a DmC game.  For the curious, despite some deviations from past From Software games, Bloodborne is still very much a Souls game.  If anything, there's more here to tie Bloodborne to Monster Hunter and especially that first time you played Resident Evil 4 than anything else outside of From.

After 45 hours, I have completed the main game and a few chalice dungeon levels. There are absolutely some cheap tactics from a few bosses, but the game is totally defeatable. Don't give up. Yharnam is a beautiful, haunting and tormented mess of a world to explore.  Despite the wild framerate hitches in a few places - Amygdala and Rom battles can be painfully chopoy - your journey is a mostly fluid experience full of environmental details missing in Dark Souls.  While I never made it through Dark Souls - the PS4 arrival interrupted my progress on PS3 - I did like the game a lot.  Bloodborne is absolutely challenging.  There are some times you may feel gutted after losing 10,000+ of your blood echoes. There are other times you will be highly upset the camera flipped out at the wrong time costing you more blood echoes.  You may even get tired of grinding the same enemy loop in the endless pursuit of stat increases.  Yet, I still believe it all to be worth it.  The element of challenge is just enough to keep you coming back.  No matter your struggles, you always believe there is a chance for your hunter to finally succeed. And so you push on and yes, you eventually do succeed.

Bloodborne is absolutely not for everybody.  If the Tomonobu Itagaki Ninja Gaiden was not your cup of tea on difficulty, this may not be your game, or maybe it is.  From Software games are just as challenging, but perhaps more fair, if more opaque. You may play this game for 10 hours thinking, ""Is it supposed to be this hard?"" and you will not realize there are, in fact, better ways to go about your journey.  Never approach Bloodborne thinking your goal is to clear enemies quickly or to run straight to a boss without looking around.  Though you would be advised to run past many enemies in the game, the number one strategy or concept I would offer a new player, is this:  Exploration is your finest asset.

In terms of difficulty for those who haven't touched Dark Souls or Demon's Souls, I would - very roughly -  compare the pacing and difficulty to playing something along the lines of Metal Gear Solid 3 on Hard without a previous play through or even The Last of Us on Survivor.  The differences here are naturally that grinding character stats will help cut down drastically on your suffering but never get lazy.  Even if you are high level - ANYTHING can kill you.  Also there are tricks for some bosses if you are adventurous and embrace experimenting.  Don't punish yourself more than you have to.  Most areas have alternate routes and shortcuts. Taking on enemies one-on-one, by luring them away from a pack is the way to go. Hone your combat. Take your time. Onward.

Bloodborne offers very little loot for your troubles and little to no exposition to motivate you through suffering, but it is surely fun, challenging and interesting.

For gamers, this system offers excellent games that allow you to play in an innovative way. What's better than actually aiming to shoot something?  Duck hunt anyone? This would be enough of a reason to get it, especially considering the price compared with the Playstation 3 and X-box 360. Zelda: Twilight Princess, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, Super Paper Mario and Super Mario Galaxy (and more) rival the best games on any system. In addition to these new games you can get Super Nintendo classics for $5 a piece and Nintendo 64 classics for $10 on Virtual Console. Super Mario World, Super Mario 3, Donkey King Country, Mario 64, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, etc. Are you kidding me? These are some of the best games ever made! And you no longer have to break out your old system and spend 20 minutes blowing the dust out and tweaking the cartridges to get them to turn on. When you look at the other systems, their games always have a bunch of hype and then, with the exception of a handful, the games are disappointing. You read those reviews and they all have the same continuing theme: the graphics are great but the game isn't very innovative or it's so big that it gets redundant. The Wii keeps bringing out high quality games with variety. Also, more and more developers are concentrating on the Wii because of its popularity and the creative opportunities, so the games will keep on coming.

This system has really been marketed for non-gamers and for good reason. My Dad actually played tennis and had a good time. He's never gone near a video game in his life. My non-gamer friends also love coming over and playing. I must admit, although I've been an avid nintendo fan since the days of the original nintendo, these casual get togethers are by far my favorite type of gaming. The Wii offers a ton of games for getting groups together: Mario Party 8, Wii Sports, Mario and Sonic Olympic Games, Smarty Pants.

It should be noted for those who haven't owned a video game system before (who are good candidates for the Wii) that it only comes with one complete controller (remote and nunchuck) and the rest have to be purchased separately. At $40 per remote and $20 per nunchuck, it adds up. With any system, you have to buy extra controllers, but a complete Wii controller is slightly more expensive than controllers for other systems since it has the complete motion sensitivity. Unlike other systems, there is enough in the box to start playing right away for one person at a time. If you are planning on taking advantage of the virtual console games (and you should) they may require a $20 classic controller as well.

Another thing worth mentioning is that the motion-sensor bar simply consists of a couple of infra-red points (read: heat). It basically would work the same of you put two candles in the same location (which has been tested by people successfully). Therefore any other concentrated points of heat are going to interfere with the motion control including candles, and in the case of my apartment, the heat being on (the radiator is only a few feet from where I sit to play). This is something that has only recently became frustrating as it's gotten colder. I imagine that for many, this wouldn't be an issue, but something like a space heater will likely be a problem.

I have to hunt for it a few seconds longer but at least I know that I'm not going to lose my stylus very easily.

So I want to get the bad out of the way because there's only a few things that threw me off or I thought was kinda weird.
-First off, Wakka's new remastered face now makes him look like someone off of Jersey Shore. I understand that's part of how his character was designed, but I felt they went a little too far with his changes.
-The eyes sometimes throw me off. They are more detailed but look more flat and fake. So there is kind of a tradeoff.
-The remastered music is awesome, but I would've really liked the option to go the classic soundtrack as well.
-At the beginning of the game they have an option for an advanced Sphere Grid, but doesn't really explain what the difference is between the original! It would've nice just for a little information on it.

So those are the only things so far that I've noticed that drive me crazy. Things I do love the changes to though:
-The Sphere Grid looks amazing! It looks very detailed and I love the new almost ""translucent"" like coloring for each character. It's a really small thing but it's really detailed.
-New menu is smooth and I like it as well.
-Finally the international version in the US! I get to play some new stuff that we never had the chance to play before! So that is really exciting there.
-Overall the characters look great and Spira overall looks great remastered for a PS2 game! There's still some jagged parts, but I wasn't expecting perfection.
-Story is still just as memorable as it was before and holds a lot of extras and replay.

As for FFX-2, it looks great and the battle system is amazing. But it's still not my favorite. I'm happy for $40-$50 I got all the international stuff and 2 games though. It's a great deal.

I do feel the extra audio that was included was to try and reel people into wanting a FFX-3. I won't give any spoilers, but if Square makes a FFX-3 and it comes out before FFXV and KH3, I am flying to Japan and slapping some execs at Square Enix!

Get this game if you played it before! If you're new to the Final Fantasy series, this is a great game.

Using the environment as your camouflage Snake makes his way to a small defunct post to rescue the man, but after you rescue him things suddenly turn for the worse.

Your mentor, instructor and lover, only know as The Boss, has betrayed you, using a special forces unit, called Cobras, that goes beyond the fantastic, has crossed over and defected to the Soviet Union, taking along two ""Davy Cocottes"" recoilless rifles that can fire nuclear warheads. One of these weapons is used to destroy the weapons factory; sparking massive crisis. After Snake has thoroughly been beaten the crap out of, he is quickly patch up and sent out into the field again, this time to stop a third world war. He has three objectives: Rescue the Scientist, destroy the massive machine that scientist was building (a tank that is able to launching an ICBM) and finally, kill the traitor, your mentor, mother figure, and partner in bed, The Boss.

MGS3: Snake Eater is a worthy prequel to all of the Metal Gear games, the Snake Character you play is none other then the Big Boss in the old NES games.

Some of the unique features in this game are stamina for character, you don't need to use any health packs as long as you keep your stamina up (by eating snakes...and other things), you can also perform surgery on yourself to remove bullets, fix broken bones and mending cuts. And similar to Splinter Cell, you can use the environment as your camouflage, also change what uniform you are wearing and apply face paint. With five levels of game play you can challenge yourself with tougher enemies and less weapons.

MGS3 has all the thrills of Japanese Anime, along with all of the plot twist, the slight feel of a James bond movie (a Bondish theme song and love story) and all the American Gun Ho-ness you can digest.

By night I am hardcore gamer, and I need a keyboard that will perform and give me an edge. My previous keyboard was the Ideazon MERC. The thing I liked about the MERC was that it operated well as a standard keyboard, but was still advantageous as a gaming keyboard. Most gaming keyboards are either just regular keyboards with useless bling, or so strange and game-centered that they aren't useful for everyday use. The MERC keyboard layout is well suited for gaming and everyday use.
While I found the standard MERC to be a good keyboard for gaming, I found it to be lacking in feel and illuminated keys.... I set out to find I new illuminated keyboard and I discovered the MERC Stealth.
I was hesitant to purchase the MERC Stealth because I was concerned that the touch/feel of the keys would be similar to the standard MERC - I greatly disliked the feel of the standard MERC because it felt the same as a super-discount $4.95 keyboard from the mega-computer-store. Upon removing the MERC Stealth from the box, all my fears were put to rest. This keyboard is heavy and feels of quality. The cable to the computer feels much more heavy-duty than the original MERC.

The MERC Stealth is everything I wished the MERC keyboard was and more: Responsive keys, illuminated keys, and as a bonus: 2 addition USB ports and microphone/headphone jacks.

The keyboard has 3 colors: blue, red, and purple. And it has 3 backlight levels, in addition to OFF!! which seems to be lacking from many lighted keyboards. While I prefer blue color aesthetically, red seems to be the most useful in low-light situations. My wife loves the purple color... I only wish the color could be changed automatically upon login to Windows.

My only complaint about this keyboard is about the onboard USB ports. These ports are next to useless for most USB flash drives as they do not provide enough power for any of my flash drives >1GB. They don't even supply enough power to run my high resolution laser optical mouse. They do, however, work with my Forcefeedback 2 controller which supplies it's own power... but big deal, more cord to coil up from the controller. It would be nice if these ports could be used for anything other than USB devices that supply their own power.

I can't tell you how much fun it is to play PVP and attack other castles with your friends. It is such a blast, and I think that alone makes this game worth a purchase. Just amazing. The PVE is simply okay. So far the story is kind of mediocre, but I am sure it will improve and it just starts off slow.

First off, like the other video games I own, I wasn't the first to play this game. I read online reviews and most of them criticized this game because the screenshots were misleading and because the game was merely overrated. Well, I'll admit, KISS Pyscho Circus: The Nightmare Child isn't a major breakthrough but the story line is fun and in a while it gets addictive.

The plot revolves around a child of evil that has been born. Not to take this statement literally, it means that a new evil has just been stirred by the close-to-defeated Nightmare King. As a last resort, this spawn of Hell as been awakened. Also, during this battle with the Nightmare King, the 4 elders have been scarred and running out of strength.  The only person aware of this is Madame Raven, a sorceress, who must devise a plan to ovecome this seed of Satan as well as choose 4 people (to substitute the exhausted Elders) to carry out this task. Meanwhile, 4 band members (with their band name being Wicked Jester, which you will remember was the first band of Paul Stabley and Gene Simmons) arrive at The Coventry, a roadhouse. Of course, they're surprised to find it desolate and deserted. But then Madame Raven, out of the blue, informs them that everyone has gone to see the circus and maybe they should too for the ""Grand Finale"" (something of an allusion to Armageddon). Then, she offers them 4 tickets to which they readily accept since they have nothing else to do. All of a sudden the four of them are surrounded by mirrors and beyond the looking glass she fills them in on ""the path they've chosen"".

You have these 4 characters to choose from each representing the personage of the band members itself: Pablo Ramirez (Starbearer like Paul Stanley), Patrick Scott (Beast King like Peter Criss), Andy ""Spades"" Chang (the Celestial like Ace Frehley), and Gabriel Gordo the Demon like good ol' Gene Simmons. Also notice that their first names begin with the same letter as the band mambers' first names, so that's a hint by itself.

I've read and heard that it's preferable and recommended to start off this game by playing as Pablo Ramirez, but it's no big deal. I picked Pablo because Paul Stanley's my priority (I was lucky enough to have him on the cover of the box). You'll start off the level as Pablo at an abandoned cafe of some kind, and like the typical first person shooter, monsters'll soon start to jump out at you. Pablo's quest, just like the other 3, is to find every piece of his armor (and also stumbling upon new equipment), with the Starchild mask being the last before getting to the real nuts and bolts of it. The final piece of armor, the mask, will then complete him and transform him into the Starchild himself. Even though this has often been related to the humurous Doom and Quake, KISS: Psycho Circus is feverishly difficult even on the Easy level setting, so saving and loading will be done very frequently. I know that there are those classic cheats of having longer lives and completing your armor without having to really look for it, but I've never tried those and it's said that they're not of much help.

Also, this game, like the name suggests, has a circus-related theme. Information on guns, ammunition and armor, will be in the form of circus pamphlets and flyers strewn all over the place, and a few monsters will be in the form of half mechanized clowns (the other half is human. Stephen King's It, anyone?). Plus there are many KISS easter eggs: Jukeboxes play KISS songs (a very robotronic version is to be expected), and there some items and equipment even named after KISS songs like Black Diamond and this drink warehouse called Cold Gin. Also, in this one level, you'll arrive at a pool place and there'll be pictures of individual members of KISS all around room.

The graphics aren't very stunning, but fairly good. While they're not completely 3D, they're not very pixelated and boxy either.

-Enemies hit like freight trains on hard mode, so no more ignoring bats, birds and medusa heads like in Symphony of the Night. Also bats and birds have insane tracking if you try and just jump over them.
-Lots of levels. Bunch of linear stages like the old games AND a full castle like Symphony of the Night.
-Monster Variety, lots of new ones and some of the old ones have new moves.
-Quests, Go on fetch quests for recued villagers. It's like what Castlevania 2 was meant to be.

What's Whack:
-Some of the levels are sort of ""pallet swaps"" (like Subzero and Scorpion).
-Some of the level music is almost annoying, but you can buy old school ""records"" to play on those levels.
-Those hard hitting, tracking bats and birds I was talking about earlier are darn hard to see on some levels with dark backgrounds.
-Spiders! FAST spiders! FAST TOUGH spiders!
-Lot of wandering around when you are looking for those last villagers...",The Bats! THE BATS!,1364947200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It more then exceeded my expectations, though it did have some annoying faults (which have since been fixed).
The Stuff I Liked:
-The Pets!-  Besides the fact that you get a TON of pets to choose from (plus if you go to the Sims website, they have more pet skins available to download), it's a lot of fun to play with and train your pets.  I couldn't be happier with how the pets themselves work - they are awesome!
-Old Town-  Old Town is a fun place to take your Sims!  You can shop for seeds to make a garden at home, enter your pet in a show, hang out at the coffee shop.. It's a lot of fun - excellent addition!
-New Items- You get a TON of new stuff in this pack, mostly related to pets!  There are lots of cool dog/cat houses, toys, scratching posts, you name it!  There are also some fun new skins and clothes.
-New Neighborhood Design- I like the newer neighborhood design.  Old Town is part of the overall neighborhood, giving you more lots to choose from!
Ok, the stuff I didn't like:
-Stray pets!- These guys are super annoying because they constantly pee all over your lot and come in your house and eat your pet food!  Luckily, there is a fix to this which you can download from the Sims site, or I believe it comes with some of the newer expansion packs.  It's a little ""no stray"" sign you put on your lot.  It fixed all the problems for me!
-Pet Family Members- Dog and cats take up a family member ""slot"", so you can only have a certain amount.  I tend to have huge Sim families, so this was a minus in my opinion.
-Old Town- You have to take your entire family (pets included) whenever you go to Old Town.  If one of your family members is at work, no one can go until they get back!  This is annoying to me and hasn't been fixed with any of the new packs.  I wish there was an option to take only the family members you want to Old Town.
Overall - I give this expansion 5 stars.  Bottom line - even with bugs, it's still a lot of fun to play!!",Great Expansion Pack!!,1070150400,23,,

Playing GT in cockpit view almost seems like I am racing in Daytona.  The feedback this wheel gives makes me feel the road and what I may be doing wrong or right.  This wheel is set apart with it's shifter and clutch.

Of course a big plus is the complete compatibility with GT 5 Prologue.  The learning curve is actually steep if you are used to using a regular controller as I am.  Although I guess if you want to learn how to be a semi pro this is about as cheap of an investment you could make.  This does make racing games a lot of fun.  The components are rather heavy and well made.  Now you may be asking, Where would I put this stuff?  A desk or table would work fine.  Although I am betting most of you don't have a table high enough or a desk available in your t.v. room.  That's where the Playseats Evolution Gaming Seat comes in.  I don't want to sound like an advertisement but if you are going to buy the wheel you will inevitably need this set up.  Of course Amazon has it available and it makes the experience that much greater.

I would advise any racing fan who either has a PC, PS2, or PS3 to get this wheel.  It really adds that experience you could only find in an arcade.  And at one buck a pop that really adds up.

* a challenge? In Fifa 06 the AI is much improved, and you will need to utilize strategy in order win. Basically, this isn't a game that you will simply pick up right away and beat opponents 4-0. It is competitive but not so challenging that you will throw down the controller in frustration. Obviously, the more you play, the better you will become, and you can always change AI levels to suit your taste.

* fun? Whether it is a single match or head-to-head play with a friend, Fifa 06 will have you cheering outloud when you score the go ahead goal. It really doesn't matter if you are a fan of soccer or not, you will enjoy this game.

* replay value? There are plenty of game modes for your entertainment: manager, dynasty, tournament, practice, etc. Plus, contrary to another review I saw, there are many, many teams to choose from (international and regional leagues).

* graphics and gameplay? The graphics of Fifa 06 really pull everything together quite nicely, and the realistic touch controls allow for smooth gameplay. Add in the stadiums, the crowd, and the announcers, and you have a real winner in Fifa 06.

Bottom line: Fifa 06 is a great game that should be in your collection. Feel free to rent it first, but you won't be disappointed if you buy it.",A solid game all around,1139875200,5,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},
5.0,False,"05 19, 2006",A2EA8BYRODWRAK,B0007VDF22,OmnilimbO,"Just when you thought there were no more possibilities for a NEW puzzle game - Lumines provides a mix of interesting visuals, great music and very solid, compelling game play that creates an extremely fun, challenging and utterly addictive entertainment experience.

One of the first things you'll notice when you load up Lumines is that it has a somewhat retro set of graphics, borderline primitive. In fact, at any given moment you'll be looking at a tile of small blocks of two different colors or patterns and a neat background. And that's it. But that is part of the charm - it's a very sharp looking game as the colors and patterns are nice and vibrant as well as interesting without being overly distracting.

The music is one of the real strong points of Lumines. In fact, the soundtrack is one of the most appealing aspects of the game. As you play the game, the music is generated a bit differently based on how well you're doing.  This keeps things from being too repetitive and makes for an enjoyable gaming experience even for extended periods.

What about the game play? Well this is where Lumines really shines. It's a wonderful game even for those who don't usually enjoy puzzle games. The game consists of two main modes. One of them, called Puzzle mode has you tasked with building assigned shapes. This provides a nice challenge and change of pace from the main mode. In this mode you're tasked with racking up lots of points by forming blocks of 4 out of the same color. The kicker is those blocks aren't instantly cleared out they're cleared out by a bar which is set to the rhythm of the music so there is a deeper level of strategy involved.

All in all, Lumines is an absolute must have game for any PSP owner.",A new breed of Puzzle,1147996800,,,

It's honestly got nothing ""new"" or ""innovative"" about it.  Battle system is semi strategic turn based with the standard physical, magical (called orbaments), and over limits.  Story is almost standard jRPG faire, with main characters going on a journey that ended up being a much bigger deal than when they first started.  Music is absolutely lovely and fitting, but I didn't find myself wanting to listen to it outside of the game (there are a few game OSTs that are so absolutely outstanding that even when i heard it without having played the game, haunted me).  Graphics are soso for the PSP, in fact it looks like a PS1 game.

In short, there's not one category that it's ""outstanding"".  However, instead of only picking one category to be ""fantastic"" at, it just does EVERYTHING incredibly well, so that when I finished my 50 hours of gameplay, I left wishing XSEED(who did the localization, and btw it is one of THE best localization I have EVER seen in western released JPRGs, including FF series) would hurry and announce the release of game 2!

If I really have to pick one thing I loved about the game though, it has to be the characters, character interaction, and dialogue.  Here XSEED seriously over-excelled themselves.  This game is incredibly text heavy, to the point of being obnoxious for anyone who's not a fast reader.  However, every single dialogue and character has so much charm to them (with the cutest face portrait!) that I can't help but look forward to every new dialogue and scene just to crack up!  XSEED, you don't know how much I adore you right now for having done one of the best localizations ever.  Move over Final Fantasy, even if you got better voice acting, you don't make me crack up like Olivier does~ <3

And honestly, I have NEVER laughed so hard over a game.  There are just so many quirky (Olivier) and adorable (Tita) characters who all speaks with their own personality that most of the time i spend a lot of the scenes giggling.  For that matter, every JRPG I've played, typically there's a few characters that I dislike, and a few that are my favorite.  This is one of the exceptions where I literally adore EVERY character.  There's certainly not a weak link in the bunch!

The story itself can be rather easy to figure out, and some plot twists aren't much of a twist when I sort of guessed who the bad guy is back in chapter 3, but who cares!  the pace (which started a bit slow in the prologue, but thereafter became very even and well paced) was good and each story makes perfect sense.  there's no convoluted-ness here (*coughKingdomHeartscough*)  The game difficulty is fairly balanced as well, but hey, if you're more the story type and doesn't want to mess with the gameplay too much, battles can be easily avoided by avoiding touching the monsters, AND there are multiple difficulty modes, allowing those who want more challenge to just change the difficulty instead.

My only regret is that this game is so little known in the US (when it was released, I literally picked up out because i wanted to BUY something, anything).  That, and the 2nd game doesn't even have a release date yet.  UGH.  I WANT SO BAD.  I actually spent a ton of money buying Second Chapter in Japanese to play while I wait for the US version to come out.  And I REALLY hope XSEED is doing the localization again, because i cannot commend them enough for the job well done.",one of the best JRPGs to date!,1332028800,10,,

It's sad. You think I would know Vince from IGN because I was right - I don't and had no prior knowledge of his review. He gave the game a 6.7. Because he didn't like the open world elements and not enough Darkzone. Like any bad fan fiction where author - think the story they have told is just awesome because it's what they wanted. When the real material doesn't match they believe the real thing is bad.

Update* 3/16/16 IF we get even get a IGN review. It has been 7 days and still nothing. Where as Gamespot and Polygon have given this game a 8 and 7 respectfully - I don't really agree with those scores but they are fair reviews. There are people with full time jobs. Who have made it to level 30. I myself only write reviews for fun but I also work on a novel and I managed one. This is Vince's job, he gets paid to review this game and can't even manage it.
Unprofessional and classless. I don't care how busy you are - you get paid to review the game. He is still stuck around level 24.
But I stand by my original claim the review will be horrible I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a 5-6 for all the idiotic fanboy reasons I always claimed. I have a feeling this will be one of these games reviewers are mixed about and many gamers love or like.

Update* 3/12/16. Be prepared for a horrible IGN review. The guy reviewing this game thinks the game should have been the Darkzone only. He gets extremely bored with the PVE aspect of this game which I consider the best part. He sounds like a Call of Duty player or typical online shooter fan hating this game for not being exactly like those.
Also he is talking crap on the game for not being an MMO. This is not a MMO. It doesn't claim to be one. It is a single player game, with multiplayer options in PVP and it has multiplayer safehouse hubs. I can't believe this guy gets paid a living wage being a reviewer. I have read better reviews here, and forums - where people do it for free.
He also gave Evolve a 9 - a game many consider average at best. I expect more from a professional reviewer. Yes he is welcome to his opinion but he isn't accepting this game for what it is. That would be like saying, ""Hmmm this apple isn't that good. It doesn't taste like chocolate cake at all.""
Here is what many who are not paid critics don't seem to understand. As a Critic it doesn't matter what you want a game to be, nor does it matter what you like. Say you hate Superhero movies. Too bad, you go there and judge the movie based on what it offers, and the demographic who like that type of movie. You must look outside your own tastes for a fair review. IGN won't be doing that here. I have no idea what the score is but I just know it will be a 7 or even worse. All because they want a multiplayer gank fest PVP only game.
Here is the deal. If you want the Darkzone to be the only element of this game? Then stay there and just do that! Why hate on a game for offering things beyond a trolling gank wonderland?

My Original Review
Military shooters are a dying interest for me. You could say shooters are too. If they aren't mixed with another genre - like RPG. Because the reality is, at best you are looking at a short campaign and a series of hamster wheels offered for multiplayer (in various map sizes).
I am glad people enjoy ""just shooters"" as I call them. I enjoyed them for a time as well. My problem isn't with you. My problem is big publishers offer very little on the market for a player like me (Battlefront, Call of Duty, Battlefield - well after 2, ect). Destiny tired to offer such a RPG but the reality is I am a PC gamer first. Destiny would have added a lot to the RPG online shooter genre if handled right. But with all the lore cut out (at the last minute) it was a grindfest shell.
Watch it will be a 6.8 score and they will say, ""Not all Darkzone. Not people running around PvE.""
If you want to pick apart any game? Make it fair, pick apart bugs, pacing, story, graphics, soundtrack, mechanics, and character creation options. Try to be objective beyond, ""I don't like the game it is CRAPZ!!!!""

Sure there are RPG shooters (Mass Effect 2 is my best game of all time). But what about just a military shooter set in our current time and a believable story? Where multiplayer is certainly an option, Co Op too, with multiplayer hubs, all the things that make it a great change of pace. But is merely an offering to the PVE. We have been crap out of luck until now. That is what The Division offers.
Much of the critizing launched at this game were by people who don't really understand what this game is not because they are stupid. Because they are used to the typical shooter offerings on the market (I do exaggerate their opinions to show how unfounded they are).
I would like to go over some of the more dramatic type of issues of complaints. The top three.
""DERE IS 2 MUCH RUNNNIN AROUND GUIZ! I jusss wanna shoott otha playas or stufff ta shoooot.""
This one is probably the second most common issue I have read everywhere. The reality is there were a lot of enemy NPCs for the beta. For testing issues. Not to mention so much pve was sealed off. Not to mention PVP is in the Darkzone
""OMG PEEEPPOL TROLLL IS DA DARKKSONE! DEY JUMPP IN FRONNT OF MEE WHIN KILLIN DA STUFFS! PEOPPLE RAOM IN PACKS AND IT IS SOO UNFAIIRRR! NEEDSSS AUTOAIMMM!""
Are you trying to tell me online shooters have trolls? I never would have guessed that! Look the Darkzone is supposed to be unfair and an unforgiving place. If that is too much for you? Do not go there. The fact anyone can betray you, anything can happen, and it is without rules makes it interesting and fun. Make friends and bring them with you.
""I WASSS JUST SO BORED HORRIBULLL GAME LOLZ""
The type of shooter The Division is comes down to taste. This isn't call of duty, this isn't battlefield. Those games are great for you. But just because The Division isn't doesn't make it bad it just isn't for you. I think Game of Thrones, and The Walking Dead is so boring I want to cry. But millions of people love those shows and my opinion doesn't make it bad. So you don't like the game's story? Open world? City setting? And gameplay? Those things are all opinion.
Here is the reality. If you craved for a military shooter with a long campaign that happens to have pvp elements? This is the game for you. If you are interested in such a game that tells a story and isn't thrown out before launch like Destinty? Again this is your game.
I play this game at 1440p and it is simply stunning to play. I also have played it on console and looks amazing as well. Simply beautiful. I really feel like I am running around new york and just the details on the clothes themselves shows immense care was put into the smallest details.
There is hundreds of hours of entertainment here with no microtransactions to speed up how fast you earn things offered (who knows that could change but great so far). Great value without a doubt regardless how much you paid. There are some reasonable complaints.
There is only a few types of A.I. and the way they move doesn't feel very inspired. The skill system could be deeper and even though safe houses will have stashes. They could really use one closer in the Dark Zone. Back at the DZ entry point. The character customization could use more depth.
But overall this is a sensational game. I'd argue at worst a slightly flawed masterpeice. When I sat down in the early 90s on a computer and thought about what PC gaming could be like. This is the game I wanted. I certainly hope this paves the way for other games like it and becomes the standand going forward. Hopefully Desntiny 2 take away some aspects of this game.
Because simply put this is one of the top games of the year. Like Witcher 3 that came out around this time last year. This will be a hard game to beat for top honor.

The Dark Zone
Customization and outfits
Graphics
Simply yet interesting game play
Open world
Plenty of hours to invest
Building up your own base
In depth and changing in game vendors
Interesting story and characters

Cons
A.I. could use more variety in both appearance and voice acting. The main voice acting is fine. The supporting cast voice acting for enemies isn't good at all.
Could be a tad grindy for some - but I love it. If you dislike grind and hate gank style PVP - run away from this game fast. (No it isn't as bad or even close to destiny grind - I enjoy grinding got to level 30 in 27 hours and DZ 30 )
Character creation could use more depth - seriously this part of the game really sucks. There are limited options. Too many people look the same and with a deep customization system this could have been a legendary game.

This is, by far, the best video game on the planet....hell, in the universe.

That's 59 total levels of mayhem....an immersive quest that you can NOT tear yourself away from.

Sure, by today's standards, the graphics are primitive and full of sprites and look a little blocky when you're up close....the enemies and items are modeled in 2D, meaning you can never look at their backside....and heck, you can't even jump....but....WHO CARES?

Microsoft did Xbox One users a huge favor in securing exclusivity rights to this title. The game rounds out a nice profile of games for Xbox One and is making my PS4-wielding friends jealous.

Pros:
- Graphics are bright, colorful, brilliant, and smooth. No drop in frames in this game.
- Tight controls. The game slowly transitions you into more advanced moves. You start with the basics, but quickly ""earn"" higher jumps and dashes. There's no training mode, so this approach is more than welcomed.
- The story is funny and witty. Expect the game to make fun of not only itself, but other games in general. I've laughed at more than just a few of the jokes.
- I love how when the ""OD"" explode and ""boom"" or ""pop"" is spelled out in the explosion. Attention to detail is amazing.
- I never quite find myself thinking the side missions are boring. They're all fun and finding new ways to blow up ""OD"" is entertaining.

Opportunities:
- Sitting on my couch from 10' away, some text is hard to read...specifically when it comes to descriptions of weapons and upgrades. (My eyes are just fine.)
- Upgrades are fun to apply, but tedious to compare and contrast them all. Maybe I'm missing a second screen opportunity, but it feels like leveling up is a little too frustrating to me.

Sure we have games like Banjoe Kazooi, Ocarina of Time but this game was the first to come out and is still an instant class and started many many famous game rippoffs(Like many people say Banjoe Kazooi was a ripoff but I DIDN'T SAY THAT so don't flame me!)but that's beyond the point, this game is still one of the most beloved video game ever.  When Super Mario 64 launched with the N64 it was indeed a very revolutionary game, it was the first game to present 3d platforming, state of the art graphics and some of funnest/best gameplay you'll see in platforming/action games.  The game is HUGE!  In Mario 64 you WILL be going through many, many stages to collect stars so you can unlock more areas for more stars and ultimatley put the evil bowser to an end and once again save Princes Peach.  I was one of many people who first played this game back when it launched with the Nintendo 64 and when you compare it to todays games the game(to many, but not me)looks terrible but you gotta understand, the time this game was released(96')it was INFACT the best looking video game ever.....period...and even today when I play this classic, it still looks amazing!  Call me crazy but I seriously still think this is one of the best looking video games of not only the mid 90's but even today, it is still marvalous!  The music in Mario 64 was just plain perfect, the music blended in with the games levels and star hunting, words cannot explain how well Miyamoto and Nintendo did for the music,it's just plain good!  The controls are also tight and well focused, I especially love the array of moves Mario has and although the controls may feel abit clumsy at times it never bothered me once!  As for camera, yes there were times were I wanted to break the tv but the reward and satisfaction of getting a star after that trouble feels so good!  Audio, controls, graphics are all A+ and as for gameplay?...Well it depends..Do you like platforming/action/exploring/collecting games because you will be collecting pretty much for the whole game(Stars, duuhhh)and if the answer is yes then this may be the best game you've ever played!  Now for me the gameplay was truly fun and innovative, I never got bored once in this game.  It's so fun, hunting for stars never gets annoying or frustraiting!  Speaking of difficulty the game is perfect, it's not hard nor is it easy like pie(acctually I take that back, for many people this game will be easy if you wanna just beat the plot)but it just gets it right on difficulty, I don't remember ever being frusraited or angry with the game(then again I never did try to get all 120 stars)and just having a great time with the game...it seriously is one of the funnest experiences I've ever had with a game and as I said before....this game is revolutionary!  Now that I'm done ranting and talking about this game I'll just get to it quickly...

The Good
-One of the best and most revolutionary game ever..period
-Back then and even today it is still one of the best looking video games ever made
-Loads of things to do
-Not hard, but not too easy, it's juuuust about right
-The game is just plain fun, the moves, the platforming, collecting, ect
-Collecting stars is really fun!
-The music in this game is just plain fun to listen to!!
-Though the bosses are easy I still think they're just classics!
-Will take a very long time to get all 120 stars, and collecting 120 stars means spending lots of time with this amazing title
-The worlds and places you visit are all so different and an amazment to look at

The Bad
-Some may feel that game is feeling abit dated now(the game is pretty old now!!)
-Some will find the graphics to be ""terrible"" or just ""bad"" which I find hard to believe
-People who just want to beat the games plot and nothing els shouldn't even touch the game(because the game doesn't take too long to beat for plot and if you're planning on not having a fun time with the game and just wanting to beat the game and getting it over with, what's the point of that?)
-Some will be angry with the camera
-Alot of people today or in the future may get this game and probably nag about how easy the bosses are well cry me a river, if you want a hardboss go play something els....other then that get ready to play one of the best games ever...

Overall Super Mario 64 stands up on its own.  The game was indeed revolutionary and braught us amazing visuals, superb gameplay and great controlls aswell as a fun adventure/like plot with lots of collecting to do.  The games music was just great to listen to, the places the game takes you are just so fun and innovative and the moves/mechanics that are enabled for Mario(though limited)are great!  The game is just plain great!  As I stated before, it is one of the best video games ever made and it indeed gets a perfect

5.0,True,"10 9, 2013",A3OZ8IB8I0VSO1,B00009ZVHU,Solid Pawn,"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is the first installment of the Sands of Time trilogy. As a reboot of a classic PC game series it is brilliant and very well made. The game follows a young and arrogant prince who, after the successful conquest of an unnamed maharaja, is tricked into unleashing the sands of time by his father's traitorous vizier. The sands kill and transform the prince's friends and family into an army of sand demons. With the help of the maharaja's daughter, the prince sets out to seal the sands again and defeat the evil vizier.
The gameplay is fluid, for lack of a better word. The prince is very acrobatic and capable of performing impressive parkour off the scenery. When fighting you can combine the free running tricks to get around enemy defences. These tricks are also key to solving puzzles and getting around the traps of the ruined palace you are trapped in. The gameplay mechanic de jure is the Dagger of Time, a magic dagger that holds some of the sands. With this the prince can manipulate time. He can slow down his enemies, he can freeze his enemies in place, and he can turn back time to undo damage and fix mistakes in combat. Turning back time is the most useful of these since the platforming can lead to instant death, balancing the difficulty perfectly. The only fly in the ointment is that the combat. It tends to get repetitive and you'll feel like the fight are small variations of the same thing.
Visually the game looks amazing. The environments are beautifully constructed. Some areas in the game are so large and breathtaking that you just have to stop and admire them. To complement the visuals is a great soundtrack with fitting ambiance while exploring and intense rock during combat, all with an appealing middle eastern twinge.
This game was released on all platforms PS2, Game Cube, PC, but I highly recommend the Xbox version for one reason. In all other versions you can unlock the original PC/Mac Prince of Persia game. In the Xbox version not only can you unlock the original Prince of Persia game, you can also get the sequel Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame. This is unique to this version.

I can not recommend this game enough. The story, the gameplay, the unlockables all add up to a sublime gaming experience. As many people as possible should play this game. I recommend this for gamers young and old, retro and contemporary. Play Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.",A Timeless Classic,1381276800,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},
5.0,True,"02 20, 2002",A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B00005MI42,Jeff Johnson,"This game is amazing, especially to me, because I did not like Wario Land and the Mario games have been done to death. Wario, who is a bigger bullying version of Mario offers a whole new game to play. Rather than Mario who jumps on enemies, leaps to punch blocks above him and collects mushrooms and fire flowers to power-up; Wario uses the direct method, ramming straight through enemies, blocks and collects hearts for energy. You can even pick up enemies to throw them. So what makes this game different than a Mario game? Because a Mario game was simple, where you go right and find the end of a level. With Wario's land, each level is a miniature maze, where you enter a level through a portal where you must then find four pieces of a stone, which are scattered in the level, then you must find the key. They key is unique, because they key is a bird who's beak is the key and it actually flies behind you and bigger enemies can steal the key and hold it hostage. You can leave the level, but the key is needed to get to the next level. To top it all off, you can't just finish a level, you must find and activate a bomb! The bomb then sets a timer at the top of the screen for you to exit the level by. Each level is very detailed and the graphics are completely different, such as a Desert, a Haunted House, a Lake, a Raining Swamp, Paradise, and a Sunflower Field to name a few. To make sure you don't get bored, there are coins, jewels and gold to collect, in which with all of this cash, you can pay to play mini games, like Roulette, Homerun Derby and Wario Hop. The graphics are great and Wario is full of tricks so there is great gameplay.","A whole new M(W)arior World, more like a puzzle challenge",1014163200,27,,

First off, for those of you who may worry if this game is the same as the console version or not, no worries, this game for the PC is identical to it's game console counterparts, with the exception of the Collectors Edition which includes an unlockable Goblin character.

Now about playability and performance on a PC.  I've also played this game on the Sony PS3, and on my computer, not only does it look just as good, it most definately runs better.  I have the game set on 1900x1200 reolution with all the detail options maxed out and the game runs flawlessly.  Also much to my surprise, I didn't even need to program my Logitech Rumble Pad 2 (PS2 Style Controller, as the game already had presets for it already made.  So not only does this game look and run better than on the console, it controls identically as well.

Now you may be asking, what kind of PC do I have that it runs so well, good question.  I'm running an AMD Athlon 64 4000+, FOXCONN Geforce 8800 GTS 640MB version (the 320 MB version should do fine for those of you running below 1900 resolutions), 3 Gigabytes of PC3200 DDR RAM, Soundblaster 2 ZS, and my HDD's are in RAID 0 (Yes, Raid is the way to go for improved Hard Disk Speed), and I have a 21"" CRT Monitor.

Okay, now that I've got some of the technical stuff out of the way, here's a little about the game.  I havn't completed the game yet but here are my impressions thus far.

Game Play:

The game play is awesome, New York City is rendered wonderfully, and is the best looking so far in the series.  This game is ""Sand Box"" Style, meaning it's completly free roam leaving you to do whatever missions or tasks you want to do, in any order.  The web swinging is amazing and not hard to get used to.  It really gives you the feeling of what it would be like to web swing around the city.

Controls / Fighting: The fighting, if you'd like to learn the combo's can be great, or you can just button mash your way through the game, if you don't wish to memorize the various combination of button pression for specific combos.  As Spider-Man you also have something called ""Spider-Reflexes"" which when activated, slows everything down and enables you to dodge enemy attacks and unleash more devastating combos.  There are also come parts of the game, to get through specific areas of the game or cut scenes, the button number of a specific button will flash on screen, and you will need to hit the buttons in sequence as they appear, or fail.  It may take a couple of trys sometime, but it's not hard.

Missions:  There's quite a lot to do in this sprawling city, and not only can you go around the city, you can also go under it, yes you heard me right, there's the full NYC Subway system, as well as sewer systems in the game, for more free roam and mission enjoyment.

Pulling up the map screen shows you where to go to see where the missions are, if you select a mission (to find it more easily) an arrow will appear when you exit out of the map, showing you how to get to that location and the distance to it.  The Map view also shows you where various challenges, and races are in the game, as well as what are good areas for crime fighting.

There are many mission types in the movie, some that are related to the story line of the movie, as well as original mission story line / content.  The missions can be fun, diverse and challening.  You also have puzzles like bomb disarming.

Final Thoughts and Conclusion (for now):

So here's the summary, if you have a decent computer / video card then don't hesitate to run out and buy this for the PC, don't dispair if you don't have the best computer, because you can change the resultion, and various detail settings to better suit the needs of many computer types / configurations.  1 GB of RAM is required and at least a 2.8GHZ P4 or equivelant.  The game runs beautifully on my system, and looks and controls better than the PS3 verion I tried.  The missions are fun and varied and gives you plenty to do in the game.  The fully rendered city, and web swinging / wall crawling is within it self so much fun it's worth getting this game.

On a side note:

For those who comment about PC Games needing patches, may be true of some games / programs but certainly not all games / programs.  Als also more and more console based games have been needing ""Pathes"" themselves lately.  I personally would much rather be running a PC game where I have more flexability to do what I want with it, and have more easily available upgrades, patches and upgrades to a program if and when they should become available.",You can do whatever a Spider-Man Can!,1179100800,8,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

5.0,True,"09 13, 2012",A1PY7278VXKI8V,B003O65TXU,Alan Dingus,"in no way is this game a 'simulator' really.  it's got more in common with GTA/NFS Underground or the like.  nevertheless, the car selection is pretty good, the driving is entertaining, damage looks pretty darn good, and the missions are fun and not terribly repetitive.  some of the challenges are HARD too.  a perfect blend of difficulty and satisfaction.  they are also structured so that you can't have a one-size-fits all car that will just tear through the events with ease.  this gives you an opportunity to experience driving lots of different cars.

the one major thing that's kind of weird is also one of the cooler/more innovative features of the game.  the premise is that you can jump from driver to driver at will.  you push a button which puts you in a flyover camera that allows you to fly over the roads and find a car you want to drive.  push the button again and boom, you're instantly driving the new car.  you can use this to your advantage in races and things by ramming your opponents with oncoming traffic.  it's really cool and keeps things interesting since you can drive any car you see, it's just hard to weave this bizarre power into a storyline that makes any kind of sense.  then again we're talking about a video game so whatever.

more pros, there's very little load time between events, cutscenes and freeroam.  so far there's been plenty to do and i've been playing it for 2-3 weeks.  the engine sounds are at least believable.  i haven't found major aspects of the game's mechanics i don't like yet.  a small improvement would be to add the ability to set waypoints on the map so that you could drive with a destination in mind instead of just warping everywhere you want to go.

overall a good impulse buy on my part.  i was a big fan of the original driver and this one is at least as fun as i remember the original being so good job driver people!","good game, kind of weak story but who cares?",1347494400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

5.0,True,"04 14, 2013",A1B5X7X3HENNJR,B0050SYV70,Michael Mac,"Many reviewers have gone into a blow-by-blow review of the game so I won't bother here. I'm a 50-something casual gamer that likes first person shooter/role-playing games that aren't overly hardcore. To me, the perfect game lets me do a lot of exploring and a lot of blowing stuff up. Far Cry 3 mostly fills the bill; it's a Skyrim meets Resident Evil 4 game where pirates substitute nicely with the zombie-like folks of RE4. The game is more linear than Skyrim but the story is less buggy. The FC3 world isn't as big as Skyrim but is far bigger than any RE world and you are pretty much free to roam and do side-quests at will.

The mission is fairly simple over-all. You are a putz travelling with your putz-brother and putz friends to a south Pacific island where you are all then kidnapped and held for ransom (and then to be sold into slavery anyway after the ransom is paid). You escape and learn combat and survival skills as you rescue your friends and do battle with the bad guys. You align yourself with the island natives and are ""helped"" along by the beautiful Citra.

Fairly early into the game the Medusa mission stumped me. In it, you are tasked at taking out 3 or 4 teams of guards/radio-operators using stealth techniques. In frustration, I abandoned the mission and began doing side-quests in an attempt to become stealthier. If you are using this review to make your decision: save yourself some grief and don't try to do this mission with your knife...bring a stealth weapon (a silenced sniper weapon or a bow-and-arrow).

Far Cry 3 has its glitches but they are mostly few and far between and are mostly of little consequence. Whereas most games of this complexity seem to have at least some freezes, this had none whatsoever. I did see a vehicle coming down the road vanish into thin air and observed a few other quirks. The only real gaffe was in the fuel depot mission near the end: a seemingly translucent vehicle had me stumped and I had to look online to see that the translucent vehicle was a placeholder where I was supposed to drive another vehicle to. That was a bizarre and purposeless artifact.

Far Cry 3 takes place mainly on and around two fairly large islands however only one is accessible until you defeat bad boss #1 -- Vaas. I think that is supposed to be the half-point of the game but because I had spent so much time on side missions avoiding the Medusa mission, I think I was better armed and more powerful than I was supposed to be when I went to the second island and thus the remainder of the game went quickly. Over there, you infiltrate the inner circle of trade-slaver and *really* bad guy Hoyt before the final showdown.

You can continue exploring the island after you make your choice, observe the consequences and wade through the closing credits.

Complaints? Not many. The biggest would be that once a mission is started, you have to see it through. Though checkpoints are taken at key moments, if you quit the game before a mission is completed, you have to start it from scratch. There are a few missions that were fairly protracted and so you need leave yourself ample time.

I should note that I've only tried multiplayer mode once without much luck.

** SPOILER ALERT **

There is an odd ending after you've left Hoyt gutted and his compounds a smoldering ruin: Citra has re-captured your friends and you are left with the final decision...a roll in the hay with her or loyalty to your friends. If you are a female, it's probably an easy decision to make. If you are male, you'll probably choose Citra but in a moment of weakness, I opted for loyalty to my friends.","A Lot of Bang For Your Buck (and a lot of explosions, too)",1365897600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Well I rented this gem and let me tell you...what fun!  I had never before in my life played any Tomb Raider  title, I knew that they were quite popular so I thought that I'd give it a  try.  At first I was really mad-I own a N64 so I was used to a certain kind  of game control, and it wasn't the kind that Tomb Raider The Last  Revelation uses.  I kept thinking ""What is the big fuss-you can't even  control her!  What is everyone thinking! .  This is so twisted and  sick"".  I worked at it and soon found out why Lara's adventures are  wildly popular.  They are so fun!

Perhaps its simplicity is the key. That, and the delightful narrator who sounds suspiciously like Sean Connery. The premise is that you get an area map of the kingdom with all kinds of quests or challenges that you must complete -- from wiping out the monsters, to reclaiming your crown, seeking the holy chalice, to rescuing your son who's been kidnapped by evil elves. The beginner levels will get you into the game and understand how it works; it's fairly intuitive and a fast learn. The advanced levels offer some challenge; some more difficult than others, and will test your ability to logically figure out solutions. I've yet to get to the expert levels.
While there is fighting in this game, once you build your ""army"" (consisting of necromancers, wizards, warriors, rogues and explorers), they automatically fight any enemy that enters your domain. They will also go off and fight enemies at greater distances. You can set reward flags up to have your army target and destroy one enemy camp over another.
Another great aspect of this game is that you get to build up your little kingdom. You place your wizards' guild, your rogues' guild, your warriors' guild and then magically houses begin to sprout up and pad out your town. You also upgrade your levels with gold, research new attack methods with a library or through the guilds, and create marketplaces and blacksmith's shops. Upgrading will get you new types of buildings (like temples) and you can watch your castle grow along with your kingdom.
You get, in this package, not only the original game, but the second release add on of the game for further adventures and quests.
It's a fun, addictive game. The quests can be short or long, not requiring a high demand on time that some games do, and is fairly straight-forward to play. I could see both children and adults enjoying this game (there's no vulgarity, but there are some jokes and humor with dialogue).

Pros:

 Gorgeous, original, & creative environments.

 Solid platforming gameplay.

 Nearly everything, from the main character, to NPCs, to the levels themselves is customizable.

 Light-hearted humour almost guaranteed to make you smile.

 Loads of collectibles to find.

 Instructions for how to create objects and characters from the game in the real world can be found throughout the game.

Cons:

 No real multiplayer (competitive or co-op) to speak of.

Conclusion:

Games like Tearaway are gems that usually come along only once every 4 or 5 years. Tearaway is beautiful, delightful, and a breath of fresh air in an industry where creativity no longer seems like a priority. If you own a vita, you owe it to yourself to get this game.

This time you are Corporal Shepard, a soldier tasked with hunting down Gordon Freeman while fending of aliens at the same time. It soon turns out that in general chaos everyone fights everyone, including new alien species and black ops soldiers.

There are a few new weapons (alien lightning gun, Desert Eagle) and some new features. You get to lead other soldiers with various specialties: engineer who can cut doors, medic who can heal you. You learn to climb ropes and at one point you can use alien technology of grappling gun.

Graphics is not great, but it's cool enough and the level design with brilliant color schemes and lighting styles makes up for it.

Music sets the mood nicely, especially dynamic themes when something serious is going down.

It's 2015 and I definitely enjoyed playing Half-Life: Opposing Force!

I'd avoided KI Gold on its initial release because it got mixed reviews and was horribly expensive (remember those first gen N64 games? Exactly.), but since I owned every other Rareware game, I decided to grab it. After grinding the controllers to a bloody pulp in all-out tournaments with my roommates, I'm left wondering why Rare never followed with a KI3.

The fighting engine in KI Gold is completely insane. It's ridiculously fast, brutal, and fully animated. KI really puts other N64 fighters (particularly the Mortal Kombat series) to shame. The engine has some pre-programmed combos and also allows you to invent your own. I'll admit it's not as deep as Street Fighter - mindless button mashing can create some intense crowd-pleasing combos whereas Street Fighter is more skill-based - but you'll need all the help you can to survive. There are a slew of one-hit finishing moves that can instantly deplete your second energy bar, and the AI isn't shy about pulling these on you every chance it gets. What's also interesting is that while the fighting is strictly 2D, the arenas are full 3D, and certain moves such as throws will change your character positions in that space.

The graphics are excellent - it's a little odd at first seeing 2D sprites on a 3D arenea, but you get accustomed to it. The soundtrack would've been worth releasing another CD for (like they did with the first game), and the controls are sharp. If you're like me and still go for a little retro gaming, Killer Instinct Gold is probably the best fighter you can get for the N64.",Fight on!,1102118400,5,,

There are already a bunch of reviews for this, so I just want to throw in my quick 2 cents:
From a complete empty to full charge, it actually takes about 1.5 to 2 hours (the 2.5 hours listed is if you have both controllers charging at the same time).
That's VERY quick in my book, considering other battery chargers I have can take anywhere from 4 to 8 hours.
It also has 2 USB charging ports if you have more than 2 PS3 controllers (just connect them via the mini-USB to USB chord, like the one that came with the controller that's included with the PS3).
The LEDs are bright and cool, which glows red when charging, and green when done.

5.0,True,"04 14, 2016",A16C5YUGBYWT5N,B00Z9LUDX4,J. P.,"This game is fantastic. I played the old one a little bit back in its heyday, and a few of them since. I didn't get into any of them really. I liked jak and Daxter better at the time, and of all the Playstation platformers I prefer spyro the most.

That said, I don't have much nostalgic feeling for this game. I didn't invest the hours and time I did with other series. So what I'm feeling isn't entirely rose colored glasses for a series reboot from my youth. The nostalgic value is there for old school platformers though.

All the awkwardness of weird jumps and bad camera angles from generations of gaming gone by are not present here. Everything is fluid and I'm having no frustration navigating the game.

I like how everything is constantly leveling up. There's always something new unlocking, and there are a lot of secrets to keep you occupied.

Consider the discounted launch price and I'd say this is one of my favorite games on the ps4 so far. It scratches the itch knack failed to satisfy for me, and will very hopefully open doors to reboot crash, spyro and ape escape.",This game is fantastic.

This console was in dire need of a solidly built, reliable and responsive third party option: enter the Madcatz Dream Pad. The first thing you will notice about the Dream Pad is that it feels solid. All of the buttons, triggers, and even the handles and chassis feel of a much more rugged and solid quality than you will find in the stock Sega controller. It also has slightly flared grips with non-slip overgrips, as compared to the plastic only Dreamcast controller with grips that went straight down. This makes the pad (imo) more comfortable to hold for lengthy gaming marathons. If you have very tiny hands, this may not be the controller for you though because it is a bit on the larger side. Given its features and layout, I don't think it could have been done better and believe most would find it very comfortable.

Aside from all of the buttons, analog stick and directional pad being highly responsive and accurate, my favorite feature of the Dream Pad is the fact that both trigger buttons are also featured on the front. This allows you the option of using either the triggers, or all of the 6-buttons on the front. This layout makes this controller especially exceptional for fighting games. If you enjoy some Capcom or SNK fighters and want your power punches and kicks quick and accessible, the Dream Pad is your answer! All moves are easily executed with the highly responsive controls on this Madcatz offering. These are also fully programmable, but I have found no use for that additional feature and haven't attempted its use. If you own a Dreamcast, but are not a huge fan of the stock controller, I cannot recommend this third party option enough.

Seems like everything is here too: All the games, all the hostess quests, all the quirky sideshops, the japanese culture, tons and tons of side stories.
I've put in about 16hrs and I'm like 3.99% done...unreal. There is SO freakin much to do in this game it's crazy.
The upgrade system has changed a little, you now get the 'soul points' per level that you can use or save for the moves/abilities that require 3+ soul points.
And with more 3 new characters to play come new fighting moves, and the heat moves are nastier than ever.
I probably only have so little completed cause all I do is run around looking to unleash these moves on these guys who don't like the way I just walked by them.
Another to mention are the cutscenes. They're kinda deep. Some of the things they talk about aren't about the game at all but about life, social issues, economic issues, political stuff...I'm not a cutscene kinda guy but I've always enjoyed the ones in Yakuza for whatever reason.
There is one major problem I've encountered with this game...your first fight in Okinawa. It could just be a mental thing but after 8 tries I couldn't do it and refused to lower the difficulty lol.

This bugged me so I took two rubber bands and attached them to the adapter and the GameCube port to hold it together more tightly. I haven't had a single problem with my Wii Motion Plus Wii Remote, Adapter, and GameCube controller combo so far. The only thing that may irk some people is that the triggers are not analog. You need to press most(if not all) the way down to activate the shield or dodge(personally its not bad at all and made me better at wavedashing when I DO have the analog triggers on the Wii). Also there is no rumble support. For me, this is not a big deal because I play without the rumble anyways. Bottom line is. It does work. It puts a smile on my face knowing I can play Smash on my Wii U with a GameCube controller.",Smash Bros.(Project M) on my Wii U with a GameCube controller,1393372800,,,

http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Cancelling-Boomless-Microphone-TBS-7010-01-Mac/dp/B00EDNLO32/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1415659170&sr=1-1&keywords=i30+turtle+beach

As of this writing, this model has not been released to the general public so this will be a little bit of advanced info for those interested.
Many of the features for the 500X also appear on the i30, such as noise cancellation and individual adjustments for the mic and headphones. The i30 is pretty easy to explain: you can use it wirelessly exactly the same way you would use any Bluetooth headset. One difference between the 500X and the i30 is that the mic is completely hidden on the i30; there is no mic boom. Once you connect by Bluetooth, both the headphones and mic will be active unless you turn off the mic. The internal rechargeable battery is charged by a USB to microB cable. You can also just plug the headphones into any device with a standard male to male 3.5mm audio cable.
The sound is absolutely topnotch! It doesn't get much better. Some have said that the 500X has poor volume. Well, that definitely is not the case with the i30. It can be extremely loud, so be careful! I had it plugged into my computer and I was listening to youtube and had to turn the volume down to less than half of max. I then went to a different website and a message came on that almost blew out my eardrums! Very painful. So, these can be so loud as to cause damage, so please be careful. If you are not sure of the volume, check it with the headphone a few inches off of your ear first. The headphones are also very comfortable, being fully adjustable in every direction. These are a great choice in high-end headphones.","This review is for the new Turtle Beach i30 Headphones, not the 500X",1415577600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Treyarch have done something very clever as they have taken everything from the old series and enhanced on it, apart from the campaign mode that is, but I'll go into that in a minute. The graphics and basic intense working engine are increased to an epic scale which I honestly can't describe, you get close to 50 AI soldiers on the screen in the more intense battles. This year the Call of Duty series goes back to its roots with the world war 2 depictions. Some said it was a bad idea given the success of the last installment, but this was quashed when we were introduced to possibly the coolest weapon of the game, The Flamethrower. This presents a more graphical and realistic quality to it as the behaviour of the flames and the interraction with the environment only add to the experience.

I mentioned about the campaign mode and feel I need to clear something up. Don't get me wrong, the campaign mode is awesome and is something quite enjoyable, but like the last installment it was way too short. I would say it could easily be completed in about 5 hours, if that. The missions are excellent and quite impactful and entertaining, but unless you're playing it on veteran difficulty, you're going to end the game feeling a little robbed. Like the last game you play through two seperate campaigns. On one side you're an American soldier entering into numerous battles with the Japanese, on the other side you're a soviet soldier retaliating against Nazi forces and eventually take Berlin.

The Multiplayer features much like the old COD4 multiplayer system with its perks for excellent gameplay. Much like COD4, when you're in a multiplayer game, you're rewarded for kill streaks.

3 Kills gives you Recon
5 Kills gives you an artillery strike
7 Kills gives you dogs

Dogs are particularly awesome as you can set them free to attack and kill your fellow online player.

The graphics are really pushed more in this game as well, I mentioned the flamethrower but also the general gore of the game is something to smile about. Say for example you torch someone with the flamethrower, you will witness their charred remains as they lay dead on the ground. Also the use of quite powerful shotguns or even rocket launchers on your enemies blows them into tiny and satisfyingly gory pieces.

Overall I would still highly recommend this game as it's certainly a franchise that will get better and better over time, especially as they push the PS3 processing power further than ever before.","It's Great, But I Expected More",1227916800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

EA Canada, with the exception of the NBA Street games, has generally always been second fiddle to the EA Tiburon Development team. With this effort they have made the best baseball game ever and a game that is impossible to put down. It's similar to Tiger Woods 2004 in that it's a sport most gamers don't really follow but it is crafted so brilliantly that you want to learn more about the real game if you to dare put down the controller and stop playing.
EA Canada has taken the big improvements they made in MVP 2003 and upgraded considerably. The hitting and pitching interface IS BASEBALL!! It can be difficult on the default Pro level, but after time it becomes intuitive and is extremely rewarding. Besides a successfull baseball player averages a hit 3 out of 10 at bats... so it's realistic. The fielding has been dramatically improved and getting a jump on the ball is easier and key to making a play. The pitching is basically identical to last year, with the exception of mound visits that can effect the confidence of the pitcher.
The graphics remind me of NBA Live 2004. The big time players do look like their real self (albiet with a kind of cartoony look), and the secondary players can look a little more generic. Sega Sports generally beats EA in this field every year and this probably won't be any different this year.
The sound is wonderful. The commentary is top notch, even better than NCAA Football 2004, and the crowd interaction is the best I've ever heard. I have surround sound speakers and I hear something new every game. You hear vendors, crowd specific chants and various fans shouting out support or reactions directed toward specific players. Wow.
Also included are eight classic stadiums, all the AAA and AA minor league teams (but with only 3 minor league stadiums), retro uniforms and 52 Legends. I'd personally like more legends and stadiums but with licensing that is not realistic and shouldn't be held against the developers.
Sega's baseball game hasn't come out yet and it may be better. Sega makes great sports games so it's possible. But I honestly cannot imagine Sega making a game better than this. I can see them making a game equal to this, but it's going to be tough.
If you love MLB you should own this game. Great job EA Canada.

1. A top-notch blu-ray movie player. The blu-ray technology came from Sony, so naturally we expect and do get latest updates via regular system updates. I also have dedicated blu-ray players, and they never update firmware... and netapps on the blu-ray players? forget them!

2. Games are are graphically superior because of faster rendering engine, and blu-ray allow storage of a lot more data.

3. Net apps - Netflix can be constantly updated. I have HDTVs with net apps like Netflix from 2 years ago, and the Netflix and other apps will always remain ancient because they will never get updated.

4. 3D - simple OS upgrade to enable 3D. Great return on investment. This is a testament to PS3 being future proof.  When it was first released (2006?), 3D didn't come out yet. But in 2009, a simple system update enabled 3D! Try this on a blu-ray player unless its already 3D-ready!

5. The new Sony wireless virtual 7.1 surround headset is made for PS3 and enhances gaming experience without disturbing others.

8. The move package along with the PS3 Sharp Shooter allows playing shooting games on a super big screen 80 - 150 inch) realistic. Standard joysticks are difficult to be precise on such big screens (for all consoles).

Unless the blu-ray movies and 3D are what's important to you, the choice between consoles really come down to type of game titles, as well as on-line play. Each console have their core demographics (Wii for younger kids, XBox for kids/teenagers/family, and PS3 for core gamers) and exclusive titles. I also have XBox slim with Kinect and both serve family well.  Given the games are not cheap these days, the console prices are really a small fraction of your overall game/entertainment investment.

Released the same day as LA Noire and all it's fanfare, this title was easy to ignore.  I picked it up at midnight at the same time as Noire and since I have finished La Noire ( another title worth checking out for sure) I am hooked on this game.  A quick rundown on pros cons.

Pros:  story is awesome, 100% coop...meaning all chapters you can drop in drop out, rpg customization that actually affects gameplay,  deep 20 chapter level story, lots of bonus objectives on each level, some tomb raider esque puzzle solving, tight controls and fighting mechanics are pretty good.

Cons:  graphics are not a plus, I would compare it to say Sacred 2,  coop gameplay only saves progress for host....not cool after you have ridden shotgun and completed 12 levels only to realize when you launch your own game you must start over,  checkpoint system not perfect.

You can clearly see pros far outweigh cons.  If you are concerned about not finding people to play with do not worry, there is at least 10 games open to join at any hour of the day....a few overseas, a few in Canada and in the US.

5.0,False,"01 29, 2015",AWSXMDDPH6E5N,B0022TNO7S,S. O&#039;connor,"I have to say that Rockstar has multiple personalities. I tried playing GTA5 and had to drop the controller because the story was tied with rubber bands. Then I played this. What an amazing game! The reason why Rockstar has more than 1 personality is because I don't know how they can throw disjointed bones together for GTA5 and have a steady game like this come from the same place.

First there is the story. The way that Rockstar focuses on the reality of this once good cop turned to a drunken she'll is deep. I won't spoil anything but the Ug do a good job of really letting u see Max's deprrssion. The score of the game also hits home so you feel the dread. There is a silver lining toward the end if the game that makes you feel what Max feels. I am huge on story and don't just plays games to play games so this one was really a deep game for me.

As far as combat goes, it is certainly refined. Rockstar took what was good from Red Dead Redemption and mixed a few elements of what Max Payne has done in the past and thrown them together. The gun variety and the movement are spot on and very realistic lile what you would see in an Uncharted game.

Graphics are amazing too. It's not a ps4 or xbox one but it holds up really nicely. Plus I installed it on my hard drive which I think makes a difference. But you don't have to if you have the space. I played it without being installed and it looks just as good. It's a matter of preference.

Overall, the game is not for the faint of heart. It is not for kids. There are some scenes that make you really feel like you are in a movie. A good revenge flick. Like I said, by the end of the game you see Max find just a small sliver of hope. It is a testament to a great game developer. I doubt they will make more Payne games seeing as how this one didn't sell all that well, but this is a fitting end to a character that grew as the industry grew.

Con
There is only one thing that this game does that might set some people back. Max Payne is a drunk that uses pain killers to heal himself. I guess to play into those effects there is this static blur screen that will come up every so often. It does get annoying during the first hour especially when you are not used to it. But after that, you do get used to it and start to understand why they do that. Of course there were maybe better ways to relay that, but I still think it was effective. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with this game. It doesn't overstay it's welcome. It's long enough to almost make you want more.","Deep, Gritty, and Real",1422489600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have only invested a small amount of time in the game so far, I have no more then one car; (1998 Nissan 240SX), but in this short time invested, I can tell you that the handling far exceeded my expectations. The cars have a serious weight to them, and its an excellent balance between an arcade and simulation feel. There are some interesting features within the game as well that really stand out. For starters, you have the ability to purchase ""special abilities,"" these are things like ""electro magnetic pulse, or EMP,"" that allow you to temporarily take down the oppositions cars. Its really quite a neat idea I believe, and even thou I'm far from attaining those abilities, I think it will add a certain element of strategy to the game that we've yet to see in a racing game.

Is the game difficult you ask? I've been reading a lot about people complaining that they find this game a lil difficult... Well I gotta say, it certainly isn't easy by an means. But it sure as heck ain't terribly hard or impossible like some people would have you believe either. Yes you have to know how to drive, if you can't drive in the real world, don't expect to ace this game, its a challenge, you must make sure you pay attention to where your traveling, and also watch for traffic, it's quite the intense experience I must say.

GRAPHICS:

Excellent in this department. I was surprised to find out that the developers used the ""RAGE"" engine that GTAIV is based off of. It runs very smoothly so far, and everything looks excellent. There's also a great sense of speed in this game, which is a must for any racing game, but especially a street racing game. Each of the games 45 or so cars and bikes are excellently detailed, and they all include INTERIOR VIEWS!!! Heck yes, I expect nothing less anymore, and I really hope the next installment of FORZA Motorsport will include dashboards for EVERY car as well. The interior view is great and it's the view I use the most. I must also point out that its a nicer seating position in the car then the latest installment of Project Gotham Racing. PGR3 had a great seating position in the car where you could clearly see the gauges, as well as where you were heading. But PGR4's quite frankly sucked, at least in my opinion.

The city of Angels looks absolutely incredible in this game, and its; almost like being there. There's a great amount of detail included in the city, and it's just a joy to look at while driving around or racing by at 180MPH! Another interesting feature is the awesome way you transition between the full city map and the game. It's very much like Test Drive Unlimited, and those that have played TDU will know exactly what I mean. Its extreamly smooth in it's transitions between the map of the city and the game, and you get wisked from a real time birds-eye view of LA right back into your car at the touch of a button, magnificent!

CUSTOMIZATION:

I gave this area of the game its own heading, because there is simply so much of it that you can do and its generally a huge aspect of the game. Everything and anything on your car can be customized, from the body panels, to the doors, to the headlights and taillights, interior features etc, and of course performance mods. Here is a quick list of what can be done:

EXTERIOR:

- Body panels, front and rear, as well as side skirts
- Wide body kits
- Headlights
- Taillights
- Exhaust tip
- Rims
- Tires (branding and tread pattern, or tire model)
- Neon
- Ride Height
- Paint (Pearl, Metallic, Sparkle, Gloss, Matte)
- Roof and hood
- Carbon fibre panels
- VINYLS

INTERIOR:

- Colour scheme
- Seats
- Neons
- Gauges
- Steering wheel
- Floor mats

PERFORMANCE: all categories have three stages, and you may choose the brands of the parts you install..

- Intake
- Exhaust
- Suspension
- Boosted / NA (Turbocharge or Supercharge)
- Engine Internals strengthened
- Roll bars
- Brakes
- Tires
- Nitrous

(there are more, I can't remember them all at the moment)

Another nice touch is that if you aren't terribly in to tuning cars, then you may choose to have the game ""auto tune"" your car for you. It will select the best parts for you automatically if you choose, to take the guess work out of it for you.

CONTROL:

No problem here, like I mentioned in the gameplay section, the cars handle very nicely. You are afforded a modest amount of drift control around corners via the e-brake, or just turning in hard and asjusting the accelerator appropriately. I have remapped the right joystick to allow me freedom of head movement in the cabin, so I can look left, right, up, or down. Thats something else that deserves a mention, we've come to the point in console gaming it seems, after so many years that developers are starting to allow us to customize the control scheme are selves, which is EXCELLENT!

AUDIO:

Another well done department here. The tires sound just right biting the pavement, and the engines pur at idle or scream under hard acceleration. My 240SX sounds bang on to my buddies real 240, and screams and pops like the real deal at all the right times. The music is a nice selection of songs, but I prefer to have the in game race music off so i can hear my car. Sound effects are well don, I can hear the gear changes when I'm in the interior view, little details like that really bring the game alive.

MULTIPLAYER:

I really have no input here, as I have yet to try it, but it seems like it might be awesome, you should be able to go online with some buddies and just drive around LA or race, which ever you choose. You can also race for PINKS!

REPLAY VALUE:

I'd say its probably fairly high, as you ca go back and re-run each race for another attempt at besting your score, and earn more money. Although there may be slightly less incentive to re try the whole career again once completed, which is usually a tend with racing games anyway, so no loss there.

BOTTOM LINE:

U CAN EDIT EVERY THING THAT YOU DID IN THE LAST ONE IS THIS ONE PLUS MORE.

BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN RACING AT ALL! Its really well done in my opinion, with subtle touched like interiors in every car, and damage, as well as the amazing selection of car customization options, and just generally good amount of racing, its worth every penny of the asking price.",Realistic....NO.....Best Racing Game Thus Far??

5.0,True,"05 11, 2016",A8XKSGA2EA6GJ,B01D8H09LQ,Erica Jackman,"I love this keyboard.

I used a K70 (the prior model) for a few years and then, after an unfortunate water accident, I switched to the highly rated Chorma Blackwidow from Razer.  That keyboard was fine, but it lacks the media keys and super convenient volume control that is on Corsair mechanical keyboards.  Also, while fine for gaming, the Razer keyboard was very fatiguing to type on and did not make for a good, all around keyboard.

That brings me to this beauty.  It is noticeably smoother to me than the Razer, but also the previous K70.  I actually still use that one at my work, so I have a good point of comparison.  The keys on this new model just feel more expensive.  They are the same Cherry Red keys, but with a shorter actuation.  I can't really explain it, but this newer model just feels more expensive.  Like it is was made with more precision.  These keys are rated at 50 million keystrokes, which is ten times the normal 5 million you see on other keyboards.  Not sure how you test that, but they sure feel solid.

Similar to other Corsair mechanical keyboard, this thing weighs a ton.  It definitely feels like a $100 keyboard.  Which is good, because it costs that much.

My only complaint with this otherwise amazing keyboard is that the shift key is a little mushy when pushed from the edge (which is where your pinky finger is going to hit it).  It is okay, but this mush stands out next to the super tight and crisp letters that you press while typing. Still, even with that issue my WPM is much higher on this than it was on the Chorma.  I really enjoy the lighter, smoother key presses.

I can't really tell if the RAPIDFIRE's shorter actuation actually makes a difference in gaming, but a quicker key activation can't hurt.

This is a premium keyboard, but I feel like the craftsmanship is worth it.",Corsair has a winner with the K70 Rapidfire,1462924800,5,"{'Color:': ' Red LED', 'Style:': ' Standard'}",

This is far better than the old Civilization games (although sometimes I go back to Civ 2 for the more real-life setting). With this game, Sid Meier proved that he's the reason Civilization was a hit (if you haven't played the non-Meier Civilization games, don't). It's kept all the good things, and added far more.  One of the unique things about this game, and that caught my eye right away, is the ability to custom-design your units. There's probably millions of different units once you figure all the possible combinations. There's also a really cool social engineering setup that basically equates to a design-a-government system. The benefits of this can be super-fast growth, production, lots of money, or a lot of other effects. All things considered, this game is spectacular if you're into turn-based strategies, and great even if you're not. It does take a little bit to get a feel for what you can do if you're not familiar with the Civilization line, but once you do, you'll love it. One warning though: If you only want a real-time strategy, or want to see lots of blood and guts flying, don't get this game. Otherwise, try it out.","Great game, Real good price",977270400,3,,

The gameplay of NG is a hack and slash sword action game, similar to Devil May Cry, or Otogi, but far far superior.  The sheer amount of combos, and fighting strategies is staggering.  The graphics are also some of the best found on this console.  All the models look high in polycounts, and everything has a polished look.  However, some of the textures can be a bit bland sometimes, but it's not a big issue.

I'd consider myself a fairly experienced gamer, and one of the most challenging, beautiful and all out extrodanariy games for the Playstation has got to be the 2-D original masterpiece, Rayman!
  What do I mean by challenging? Even after all of my best efforts and devoted hours to this title I still have yet to beaten it. Rayman has over 30 massive levels ( including bounus levels, ) with some of the most vibrant and imaginitive colored backrounds on each level which are layerd to look like they never end! And it works remarkably to make you believe that your in the shoes of that limbless lion-hearted hero Rayman out to save your world.
  Rayman also offers deep gameplay and many moves, such as using his surfer hair for flying like a helicopter and his fist for powering up, grabbing nearby items, and firing out at enimies. He uses climbing and crawling technequies to acheive unexplored parts of any level, and can run and shrink to escape faster from threats.
  Rayman adventures through many magical relams, which include Band Land, Blue Mountains, Picture City, Dream Forest, The Caves of Skops and finally, Candy Chateau. These worlds have their own quirky enimies and backrounds according to their themes, and have many passages a creatures to save hidden somewhere in them.
  Many other sequals such as Rayman 2, Rayman Rush and Rayman Arena are all in full 3-D, but are never as fun ( don't get me wrong, Rayman's sequals on Playstation and Playstation 2 are good, ) or as grand of a spark as the original. Rayman sure has had many changes to appeal to his new generation of gamers.
  Despite it's childish looks, Rayman has something to offer to any age and ""breed"" of gamer, and should belong on every Playstation owner's shelf.

5.0,True,"09 7, 2014",A1VJX9LLHAPQN7,B00GLZQR96,w r e c k l e s s,"This is about as good as hack and slash action RPGs get. There are 6 classes to choose from that can all be played as either male or female. The Witch Doctor and Wizard are the spell casters; the Barbarian, Monk and newly added Crusader are the hard-hitting melee attackers; and lastly, the Demon Hunter is the ranged crossbow/bow sniper. They each have their own style of play. In the ""Ultimate Evil Edition"" the max character lv is increased from 60 in the original game to 70 (you can also import characters from the original PS3 ver). The game is split into 5 acts, the fifth being the new expansion, with a whopping 10 difficulty settings. The way ""Diablo 3"" works is that you pick a class and then proceed to lay waste to every foul demon you come across, gaining levels, unlocking new abilities, and equipping better gear as you go. The narrative is just window dressing. Some people will only ever play through the story mode once or twice just to experience the game and then move on. This would be a mistake. Playing through the story is just barely scratching the surface. The best of what ""D3"" has to offer comes once you've hit lv 70. It's then that you start strategizing what combinations of active and passive skills work best, slowly start moving up in difficulty with the goal of playing on Torment or higher (where the best gear drops), and begin to really pay attention to the stats of your equipment and what bonuses specifically you need to upgrade via the new Enchantress. What also makes playing at lv 70 so enjoyable is the new Adventure Mode, which includes bounties (quests) and a special dungeon called the Nephalem Rift. Playing 4 player co-op, online or off, enhances the entire experience. I must also note this game looks and plays flawlessly at 1080p/60fps. If you're a fan of the genre, you really can't do better.

In practice, I never liked them because they tended to get in the way, and I prefer actually being able to have my F# keys work as they should without having to go through convoluted keyboard shortcuts.

Mercifully, default behavior for this keyboard has the F# keys as F# keys, and the Fn key is out of the way enough to not have impeded in any of my gaming. Kudos to Rosewill for finally getting it right.

Coming from cheapo membrane keys, I'm still occasionally caught off guard by the sensitivity range of mechanical keyboards like this, as I would occasionally find myself sleep-typing with a key held down without realizing it. Guess it's just something I need to get used to. Also, if you are like me in that you prefer a pure, simple keyboard and pick this up? Don't bother installing the software from Rosewill.

I owned one of these for a good year, year and a half. But then I sold it to an ex-friend's brother for 40 bucks. Forgive me, I was desperate, and wanted a DS (although I didn't put the money towards one =P)!

All in all, a great, reliable system that can be used years to come!

I hear that the pink and light blue ones have better battery life and a brighter screen, like the Nintendo DS Lite.

Worth a purchase!!!

Pros:

Great games
Small
Colorful
Did I mention the great games that came out for this???!
Comes with a charger
Charges rather quickly

Cons:

Too small for larger hands
Some of the games were mindless (Looks at 95% of the Disney games) (Is ashamed to be a human)
Scratches somewhat easily

If you take care of it though, you won't have to worry about many scratches. Also, if you lose your charger, they're dirt cheap here at amazon!!!

5.0,False,"11 18, 2016",A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B01C93CWSI,T. Skylar,"Perhaps the most approachable games in the series yet, Pokemon Sun and moon contain traditional elements that allow players to jump in and feel right at home and serve as a perfect entry point for anyone new to the world of Pokemon. Wether you've been a fan all along, a newbie or if you've put your quest to be the very bestlike no one ever wason hold, Pokemon Sun and Moon have something for every type of fan and gamer, casual or serious. Welcome to Alola.

The way the player navigate and explore this brave new world is more Legend of Zelda than Pokemon and that's a good thing. Gone are the days of gyms and badges, instead you're completing challenges and solving puzzles across four island. Sun and moon are all about exploring islands, trials (which replace gyms essentially) and side quests. As a result, the games have a much more open world and free-roaming feel to them. It's different and a welcome change. Nintendo didn't need to risk tempering with a successful formula, but Soon and Moon are better for it.

The mix of Pokemon included in the game is perhaps the best thus far. Sun and moon presents a perfect mix of old, middle of the road and new. With 2016 marking the 20th anniversary of the franchise, it made sense to include classic Pokemon as well as fresh pocket monsters to keep it interesting. To be fair, some of the new Pokemon in some of the last few generations have been meh, Sun and Moon is an improvement on both quality and creativity. The Alola Pokemon are a nice touch as well, offering a different take on beloved Pokemon, some of them genuinely cool.

The environments are visually impressive on the 3DSeven in battlesand more complex than any previous portable Pokemon title yet. They don't merely improve on past titles, Sun and Moon is on a whole other level of Pokemon games. Environments are rich and varied, houses look spectacular and the islands are like going a small getaway. I easily lose tracks of time doing side quests and visiting every square inch of the game. Even the houses, shops and various buildings are a joy to visit now with intricate and beautiful layouts. Sun and Moon also stand out by feeling and looking much more 3D than its predecessors.

The mechanics for the most part have stayed put. Combat still functions in the same way, with the addition of Z-Moves that offer a more visually compelling experience, at least initially.

A few more additions/changes

-4 player battle royale had to be one of the best and wildest additions to Sun and Moon. It's madness and tons of fun.

-Customization options are large than ever before ranging from clothes to haircuts and everything in between.

-You can take photos of wild Pokemon which adds a fun element to the game reminiscent of Pokemon Snap.

-New, updated Pokedex that will talk to you. Improved Pokemon management/storage.

-Interactivity with Pokemon had been heightened by caring, cleaning, feeding etc.

-Team Skull replaces Team Rocket, Galactic etc.

-Movement is much more natural and less d-pad direction-oriented, games makes great use of analog and running.

-Opportunity to transfer Pokemons from Red, Blue and Yellow, more compatibility to come.

-Festival plaza provides a more interactive online experience than ever before.

-Fishing is much more restricted and limited. It used to be if there's water you can fish but that's changed.

As with every new Pokemon games in the franchise, Sun and Moon have differences that make them unique from each other. Most notably night and day. Sun mimics the 24 hour cycle while Moon is forwarded 12 hours which means it will have night during day and day during night. Some challenges and activities vary also.

There's always something to do, somewhere to go; it's busy game. Longtime fans and hardcore gamers will also be happy to know these new entries in the franchise are more difficult than the last few. That said, it is not so difficult that it'll make you give up either.

The sheer joy Pokemon fans will get from playing Sun and Moon is worth the price of admission. It's new, it's classic, it's different, it's like relieving your childhood all over again and it's glorious. A beautiful and very ambitious entry in the Pokemon cannon.

5.0,True,"03 18, 2011",A3LGDXHXYBMGCY,B00309U0M6,drollere,"this is a significant step up in conception and execution from the original DS. rather than repeat the many positive observations already raised in other reviews, i'll hit a few personal high points.

as in DS, it is possible to play through the game on the ""normal"" difficulty and die only rarely. this greatly enhances the cinematic immersion and mood reality of the game and downplays the usual ""run and gun"" gamer environment (although ""run"" is, in several situations, the first move necessary to survive them). in fact the game is most enjoyable when played slowly and cautiously -- scanning the environment for hazards, moving carefully around corners, through doors and debris (several ""gotchas"" are waiting in these situations), and listening for the sound of approaching necromorphs (especially from behind). the hazard contexts vary from narrow corridors to open chambers, from mine shafts to outer space, so the sources of danger are continually changing.

playing slowly allows one to savor the settings in this game, which are genuine works of art -- visually, aurally and conceptually. each environment has its own mood, lighting and color scheme. colors are used with a painter's eye to light and texture; dominant colors are artfully balanced by complementary accent hues, dark is punctuated by light. it is rewarding to replay the game just to enjoy the superlative uses of color, sound and lighting. the music score tends to introduce the mood of different locations or to ratchet up the panic in ambushes, but otherwise is well balanced by dramatic silence. (compare ""assassin's creed: brotherhood"" where the repetitive music becomes an annoyance.) the ""predicament tension"" is nicely scripted -- just when you think you're clear of a hazard, you're not!

the diversity of weapons is not overwhelming (compare the useless assortment in ""red dead redemption""), and one attraction of replay is to try out other combinations ... although the brutalizing tools (flame thrower, sawblades, sniper rifle, contact beam) are not as versatile or effective as a fully upgraded laser cutter, line gun, pulse rifle and javelin gun.

DS 2 is completely stripped of any ""busywork"" activities -- those pointless routines where you collect flags, tokens or charms, hunt down a list of individuals, do chores or errands, take on jobs, and so on. for some reason game developers seem to have concluded that these add ""realism"" when in fact they usually add tedium. none of that in DS 2 -- you have stuff to do and you get to it.

the final boss battle between clark and the marker conceals an amusing and possibly pointed irony: it seems very hard until you figure out how easy it is. (hint: alt fire from a fully upgraded pulse rifle or line gun is the first step.) and, even as the credits roll, the narrative takes an unexpected and ultimately humorous twist. (""what?"") two twists, actually ... but the second is only a promise that DS 3 will be forthcoming.

in my previous game reviews i complained that the stereotypical game narrative is generated by another character (typically female) telling the male avatar what to do next and when or how to do it. in DS2 isaiah clark makes many of his own decisions, has to resolve some unannounced situations, and has to exert repeated control over other characters. finally, a game persona i can relate to. i also regretted that the ""talent"" was credited below texture mappers, QA testers and accountants: in DS2 the credits roll over the closing sequence with the actors at the top where they belong. (of course ... the game executives get top billing in the intro.)

two technical innovations would greatly amplify this game. first, there is really no reason why the player could not choose the gender, male or female, of the focal character; yes, more dramatic and sound production would be involved, but this is a game that appeals disproportionately to female gamers. second, there is no reason why a subset (or even all) of the creature encounters could not be randomized, so that they vary from one replay to the next.

DS 2 is flawlessly produced and ran on xbox without a single lost save, animation glitch or control anomaly.",video game as multimedia art,1300406400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The problem is that on line games can be pretty laggy, and it can be a challenge finding a game that's really fun and not frustrating.

It lets you get used to the wide range of characters (male, female, black, white, alien), the types of weapons and maps available. Once you're SURE you're comfortable with that all, it's time to step up to the plate. You take the game on line on the XBox Live.
Choose your type of game, the number of players you want to go against. You can join a game for novices if you're just getting started, or against the skilled warriors of the world if you're experienced. You can put mutators on the map, go for deathmatch or capture the flag or other gaming styles.

Michael Jackson The Experience is just that, an experience. It actually feels as if you are Michael; it's the closest thing anyway. The Nintendo Wii's technology allows the player to perform MJ's dance moves and feel a part of it all. The Wii version of the game is already out and there are DS and PSP portable versions available as well, and the game will be released on PS3 and XBOX 360 in the near future.

The beauty of Michael Jackson The Experience is that you really feel it, you're into it and dancing along to Michael's moves which is amazing. Anyone can start playing right away and get into it right from the first play; of course it's harder when beginning but the player will pick it up pretty fast. I was slightly disappointed that you unlock the tutorial videos as you play and that they were not available from the start but it's not like it ruins the experience. The idea of the game is simple, you're either Michael or one of the backup dancers and the icon on the top left corner of the screen shows you what you're supposed to do, it shows the move. There are also golden moves that give you more points, with points you get a rating from 1-5 stars. 26 songs can be played and if you buy the game at Wal-mart or HMV you get the bonus song ""Another Part of Me"" me from Bad.

Personally I don't play The Experience for rating I play it for fun and for exercise. Careful, it's harder than it looks!  It can be hard to match perfectly the moves in question as the responsiveness is not always 100% accurate. Oh and you will need space to play this game. I was a little surprised with the songs included because yes, the hits are there, but there are some songs I would never have had expected to be on it like Ghosts! I'm hoping to lose a few pounds as well; this game is an excellent way to exercise, and if you don't believe me try it! I bet that after a few songs you will be sweating as much as I was! I think the exercise factor is important here because whether you want to exercise or not this game is fun and is a great way to stay in shape. This can only enhance an already stellar game.

I'm just glad that with everyone trying to make some money off MJ's death that this game is truly worth it. Fans young and old will no doubt enjoy this game and dancing along with the King of Pop, I just wish Michael would be alive to see the enjoyment he brings to so many people! I think Michael would've had approved of this game, it's hard to do otherwise. If you are a fan of Michael or know someone who is this is a must have and a perfect gift. There are plenty of good dance games for the Nintendo Wii such as the Just Dance series and the Dance Dance Revolutions games and this is without a doubt a great addition to the dance games category This game has hardly left my Wii since I have it. 5/5 for both a fun, well constructed game and for the exercise it provides.",What an experience!,1292716800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Compared to my PSP case that I bought a long time ago from eForcity (much cheaper in every way, including the sturdiness), this is clearly a superior product.  I don't mind spending the $$ to protect my even more $$$$ investment, especially if it now looks even nicer!  I do wish it comes in more tinted shades like green, yellow, red, etc., etc.  I would've been all over the green or yellow (or even buy different ones to switch around when mood strikes).

Additionally I like how having the case made the vita just a smidgen thicker, which made it much easier to grab/handle.  I noticed I was so worried about scratching it or touching it where I shouldn't with my greasy hands (due to sunscreen sometimes) that it made it harder for me to enjoy myself.  Now that I have the case, not only do I not fear just grabbing it when I need to, but the slightly thicker object was easier to hold in my hands too.  Note that I do not have large hands (i'm a 5'5"" asian girl) but it did not change the fact that I found the Vita to be a little too thin for me to handle without the extra layer of the case.  Maybe that's just me.

Pros:
Both my top and bottom screens were IPS (hallelujah!).
No scratches or defaults in the product (buya!).
Both Pokemon Red and Blue were pre-installed (as expected).
Both the Charizard case and the Blastoise case were present (as expected).
All AR cards present (as expected).
Arrived on time (as expected).

Cons:
No download code for the exclusive Nintendo 3DS Pok&eacute;mon home menu theme as promised (not a big deal, but really insulting).
Charizard case is not in perfect condition (honestly you wouldn't notice unless looking for an imperfection).
Not U.S version (Malaysian/Singapore version, which is basically the same exact thing).
Product is overpriced at 285$ (you can get a used New 3DS XL for less than 200$, but I wanted this one bad enough to spend the extra money).
Does not come with charger (as expected).

Summary:
I am really happy with my product.
Although my Charizard bottom cover (the one that comes already attached) has a few imperfections, you can barely notice. It is a little insulting that they say it's the U.S version when it's the Malaysian version, but they are the same thing, so I guess it makes sense that they would pass it off as the U.S version (less confusing that way). It's SUPER insulting that they tell you you're gonna get a download code for an exclusive Nintendo 3DS Pok&eacute;mon home menu theme when you clearly are not, but that could be a mistake on their part seeing how the AR codes are not mentioned at all (they must of gotten the two mixed up, or maybe some come with the Theme codes and some come with the AR codes and they failed to mention that). I would take off a star for these few mistakes, but the fact that both my top and bottom screens are IPS and that my product came in near perfect condition more than make up for it.

Although the game as sold is exactly as stated in my original review below, and although I found the game seller WildTangent to be next to useless for any assistance, the posts on the WildTangent forum made by the actual users are a completely different story.  The modding community for Fate is simply jaw-droppingly amazing - the range and creativity of the available modifications is astounding, from Maestro's awesome Japanese Town and Heron's teenage mod to the relatively simple (but enormously fun!) jewelry and item packs - all wonderful and all free.  Heron and his merry band have even created several free patches to modify Fate the Traitor Soul to contain the levels from both of the prior games (although you still cannot play the prior games separately; rather all three become incorporated into one game).  These patches (and oodles of other mods) are available free on the Wild Tangent forums for this game - see R. Bruno's comment to my post.  The game itself is just a standard dungeon crawl kill 'em all with decent graphics and no story line to speak of (basically a gore-free dumbed down Diablo), but the ease with which this game can be modified and the wonderful modding community gives it a whole new spin and raises it from eh to awesome by turning a game which is basically about destruction into something that is all about creation and creativity.  Seriously, if you have this game or are considering buying it, check out the modding community on the Wild Tangent forum and let the fun begin!  The selection and quality is terrific, and once your start exploring the engrossing world of Fate game modding, I guaranty that in a very short period of time you will be itching to create your own custom mods.  The beauty here is just how easily this can be done by the average person; Fate seems tailor made from the ground up to be a great introduction to computer program basics and the simpler mods are so easy that a child could do them with a small amount of adult assistance.  I can verify this from experience - the look on my 10 year old nephew's face and the sense of self-worth he felt when he made his first mod and it worked was worth every penny I spent on this game.  The more complex modifications require 3dMax and a lot of practice, skill and patience - but even these are within the reach of a dedicated and artistic amateur.  The two of us have been having a blast with this - and in the process we've both learned a great deal about hex, program logic and 3dMax!  For me, after an initial horrible disappointment, this game has turned out to be a win-win - all thanks to the modding community.  Kudos guys and gals - you rock!!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM June 6, 2010:

Box for this game has pictures of the boxes for ""Fate"" and ""Fate Undiscovered Realms"" with the words ""Bonus Inside!"" indicating the two earlier games are included - this is not the case.  I was unable to find either of the two earlier games on the disk, nor any instructions for downloading them so I contacted WildTangent by email.  Their response was:

""Fate The Traitor Soul contains content from Fate, and Fate Undiscovered Realms. The package unfortunately does not contain full versions of those two previous games. If you go to the Temple of Fate you can access dungeons from Fate UR. After you complete the quests and defeat Kaos you can play an extra dungeon that contains mixed content from Fate and Fate UR. I do apologize, if there was any miscommunication in the matter.""

Well, I feel used.  This may be relatively minor in the big scheme of things, but is still yet another example of complete lack of ethics by big business.  By the by this is apparently not an isolated example for WildTangent - do a quick google search for ""WildTangent scam"" and/or ""WildTangent problems"" and see for yourself.  Apparently WildTangent is yet another in a long list of corporations that are lower than pond scum.

The game itself was disappointing and is not nearly as good as the original Fate, which itself is a Diablo clone.  My advice - get Diablo II.  If you must buy Fate, then get the original Fate on CD from Amazon (do NOT download from Wild Tangent!) and avoid Fate Undiscovered Realms and Fate the Traitor Soul.  I've played all 3 Fates and the original Fate is the only one worth bothering with.",Misleading advertising as sold - but Mod it and it turns to Gold!,1275782400,14,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},

Basically it is Turok meets Doom 3 on steroids. If you like first person shooters (fps), then getting Prey is probably the next best move you will make next to owning Half-Life 2: Episode 1 and F.E.A.R. The future of fps in space has not outlived its lifespan. If you liked Doom 3, which was the last good adrenaline pumping monster mash on Mars, then you will love Prey. Prey is back to basics again, whopping up the graphics considerably, brilliant lighting effects and a frightening story to boot that isn't afraid to have lots of gore and shocks around the corner. It has a certain feel of HALO about it too with its alien-type weapons. You play an Indian who has been beamed up off his reserve into a spaceship where the aliens are eating up the humans. Prey has awesome in-game action sequences and is quite shocking for the sum of its fiendish parts. You have an old Indian trick out-of-body-experience (OBE) which helps you to reach areas in the rooms you can't normally get to. The rooms also rotate when you shoot switches which offers various level puzzles to get through. Most of the time you totally loose your orientation which makes the play even more fun, especially when portals start opening after room rotations. Duke Nukem lovers will also enjoy the fun on display. An alien's severed hand to open doors is a nice touch. Art Bell's radio talk-show of the aliens invasion is broadcast at various junctions in the game. You don't die either. Well you do, but you are given unlimited chances to regenerate your blue or red health by shooting at blue or red birds in the land of your ancestors. It is a great idea and works. The Boss fights are massive. You even get to fly some aircraft with fire power. Running along anti-gravity tracks around rooms upside down and across walls while unloading your gun into the screaming aliens that have driven people insane who are crying banging on doors is probably reason enough to own the thing if it wasn't for the photorealistic gfx. Slime on the wall has never looked so real. The end boss battles are amazing. The graphics are simply outstanding. This is a high quality fps that deserves your time and CPU power. Prey it today.

The Wii Sports is actually really fun. I've played the Tennis for several hours without getting board. It's designed for a different type of play style so it can be hard to get use to the controllers at first.

The graphics are not all that amazing, but it's okay because the wii sports games it came with are so fun, that you don't really notice the graphics. For example, some of the computer players don't even have legs.

I don't think this system was designed to impress people looking for amazing graphics, it was geared more to people that like to be active while they play. If you are the type of person that likes sitting down when you play, most of the wii games probably won't be good for you. Most of the time you need to stand up in order to get the controllers to communicate with the system.

BLACK SYSTEM: I got the black system and I really like it, however, one thing should be noted that it is a huge magnet for smearing and fingerprints.

It came about one week after, by the way I live in Guatemala, and I was really really surprised. Not like an epic Metal gear of Uncharted of course, but actually a refressing one, and style of game. Also a lot of quality on it own.

Graphics: Really impressed, textures really show themselves. The shadow of the character is really well done, a lot better than those pixelated ones from Call of duty games. A great special effects, feels great when someone throws a grenade at you.

Sound: Voice acting is not the best, but does the job. Special effects, rock solid, specially on explosions. Music... according to the moment but nothing memorable.

Control: Great, maybe few more actions are welcome but the way it is keep it simple and easy to jump in.

Story:  So far solid, its not as sissy as I thought. It actually keeps you  waiting for the next portion to solve whats happening. Its simple.

Style. Somehow it reminds me to Gears of War, but somehow to uncharted too whis is better, its not a shooter and thats great because there's too much shooters these days.

Overall: This is not a 10 out of 10 game, maybe an 8 - 8.5 game. But its a satisfying one, its a game that really shines if you are not comparing it to those new classics.

They were excellent horror/mystery hybrids that gave the player an investment in the characters. I really wanted everyone to survive (well, almost everyone, but I won't spoil anything here). Nippon Ichi's localisation is excellent. Similar to Phoenix Wright, there are copious cultural and anime references thrown in (especially for uber-otaku Hifumi Yamada). This adds a touch of humour and lightens the bleak mood of suspense, horror and ceaseless trepidation.

DanganRonpa takes a similar vein with high school students. Not yet ready for independent life and for the most part naive and inexperienced, they are thrust in a situation very similar to the premises in the Saw films - they must do unspeakably awful things to survive (or escape, in this case) - murder a fellow student and get away with it. As very few of the students know each other (the protagonist only knows the pop star), the apparition of murder looms close behind at every step.

With spine-chilling music, a brilliant premise and courtroom scenes reminiscent of Phoenix Wright (albeit with a dark, macabre and ghoulish twist), the multiple paths, relationship-building and collectibles provide replay value far beyond that of 999 or Zero Escape. There is a considerable amount of text to slog through, but it's never dull or repetitive. I always find it hard to turn off and go to bed at night.

+ This will keep you busy for a while. It has everything from classic FPS action, to puzzle, to insane online multiplayer.
+ The price considering all five games is very low.
+ The ""Source Engine"" these games run on are very computer friendly and do not lag even on some older hardware.

- For those who do not like Steam, don't buy this. I personally have no problem with it, but unfortunately to you people it is required.

5.0,True,"02 6, 2009",A2KWJ1TZC6C60P,B0017HIH6O,John Kane,"SH3 is the best Sub sim ever. Just keep in mind that because it is realistic, it can also be frustrating at times if you used all your torpedoes and only sink 1 ship. There are also times (ie: in the English Channel) when its best to stay submerged at 3 knots and use silent running when 3 destroyers and a couple of cutters are searching for you. Once the enemies warships spot you they are relentless. You can literally spend hours just crawling along, even this part is fun until you get sunk that is. :(
The game realism settings can be turned on or off but its definitely more fun do the targeting manually. It takes a few missions to get the hang of it. The manual is of great help(its located on the disk.)

As far as SH2, graphics are important to me and the SH2 graphics are outdated for sure, but SH3 looks great except for the trees. The water looks very realistic, especially when the seas are rough.

Here is a tip for customizing the map time compression options in SH3 to your tastes.

You can edit the time compression by opening the document named main.cfg  -This is located in the SH3/data/cfg folder that the game places in your documents folder(the same place where the game saves are found. This file can be opened with notepad or word document, just be sure to uncheck the box that says 'Always use the selected program to open this kind of file.' Its also a good idea to copy this file to a different location before editing in case you need to restore the original later. In order to set the enemy contact to real time you would change the value under [Time Compression] EnemyDetected=8 to EnemyDetected=1

I also changed the maximum from 1024 to 2048 for moving around the map faster. Then I changed CharacterAnim to =2 as the default was something like 32 and was making me seasick to watch.

Changing AirEnemyDetected=1 to AirEnemyDetected=0 will make the game pause whenever an enemy plane spots you. You won't see the default message saying that a plane has been spotting as the game will just pause. You could do this for enemy contact as well if desired. This is nice if you leave your game run to make a quick soda or sandwich run.

UPDATE: When I first started doing campaign missions. I only averaged 1 and 1/2 ships sunk per mission using 100% realism settings and manual targeting. After learning interception techniques and Fast 90 attacks form a subsim forum, I averaged 7.5 ships sunk per mission. So its worth your time to check out one of these forums if your new to Subsims as I was. There was a bit of a frustration factor in learning this game but it has layers of depth to it that make it rewarding once you have it down.",6 Stars out of 5,1233878400,40,,

5.0,False,"03 27, 2006",A285YCRWRJVM1R,B0009XEC0C,Super Cool,"Mario Superstar Baseball has alot of Mario charm, and a fairly large roster of Mario characters to select from.  The baseball fields, with the exception of Mario's field, have obstacles in certain parts of the outfield that can certainly make things more interesting.  I think the single-player has four different cups along with different difficulty settings to choose from with the Bowser Cup being the most difficult cup.  It has been a while since I have played the single-player campaigns because the multiplayer is extremely addictive.  In fact, Mario Superstar Baseball is quite possibly the most addictive multiplayer game on the Game Cube with Mario Strikers taking second, TimeSplitters Future Perfect and Digimon Rumble Arena 2 taking third, Super Smash Bros Melee taking fourth, and F-Zero GX tied with Mario Kart Double Dash taking fifth.  The talent on your team will depend on the players you select.  The captains have the abilities to execute superpower hits and throw superpower pitches while ordinary characters can wind up their hits and pitches.  The base running is okay although sometimes it is a bit glichy when you are trying to advance a runner or send one back to base.  The fielding for the most part is good, but not without unnecessary difficulties in controls for throwing the ball towards the base in the direction of the obvious base-runner.  And it is this factor which often times determines the outcome of the game with friends.  Yet, it is so funny and simply fun to watch characters like plumbers, mushrooms, turtles, goombas, and others march around the bases, which any professional baseball player could throw out at their pace but the characters in this game.  In addition, challenges like homerun derby and wall-ball await you in the single-player campaign and playing in the toy field is another great option for multiplayer fun.  If you have to choose one multiplayer game for Game Cube, then this game is the one.  Note:  Multiplayer baseball games are only between two players, while the toyfield hitting game is for up to four players.  In conclusion, I like Mario Superstar Baseball because it is like no other baseball game out there and it has alot of charm.  Simulations of baseball tend to be just no fun.  If you like realistic baseball, then maybe you should get off your couch or floor and turn off the TV and go outside and play some actual baseball.  The same is often true for other simulation sports games, which are more often than not zero fun and cannot compare to actually going outside and playing the sport with some friends.  It seems like the video game industry is counting on people in this society as having no friends or friends that are no fun, so they make these simulation sports that might give a miniscule amount of enjoyment to simulate what it would be like if people actually had friends and played sports.  Get out there and play sports not imagine you are playing sports.

5.0,False,"07 8, 2018",A3DK9DG8NLVF6,B01GW3P9PE,Bugson08,"Video games feature a wide variety of genres that cater to different players and playstyles. From the classic RPG mechanics inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and the like to fun hack n slash games meant to give you a sense of satisfaction from pulling off crazy combos, games are as diverse  if not more so  than any other art form. Heck, gaming probably features all the art forms that a movie has plus the ones that are exclusive to gaming. If a developer wants to make a thriller story like Silence of the Lambs but also throw in some classic platforming gameplay, nothing is stopping them. And while it is great that the medium can have such a diverse way of expressing itself, this also creates the problem of leading some people to become disappointed when a particular genre becomes too popular. For example, some people (such as myself) are not the biggest fan of battle royale multiplayer games like Fortnite, but I would take a PlayStation platformer like Spyro or Sly Cooper any day of the week. While this will always leave some disappointed, I think that it is best looked at through the lens of Well, at least some groups are happy.

This new God of War, developed by Sony Santa Monica Studio (who developed all the previous main titles in the series), marks quite the change for the beloved franchise. No longer are you playing as Kratos, a god seeking revenge in a fast-paced action-adventure hack n slash that lets players live out their wildest fantasies of slashing gods and titans; instead, you play as Kratos, a widower and father who is trying to live a simple life in a game that, while still featuring many combat scenarios, has a far greater emphasis on story, characters, and exploration than previous games. Ive read many discussion threads and articles online that praise this new direction the franchise is taking, but also quite a few that dismiss it because its not God of War. While I personally agree with the former, I think that it is best to discuss this game as its own being  it isn't a total reboot (this is the same Kratos in the same storyline), but it is certainly a rebirth of the franchise. And as far as the developers goal in trying to breathe new life into a series that some thought had its glory days behind it, they not only succeed but also create one of the most beautiful, touching, grand, and just plain fun experiences of this gaming generation. THIS is God of War

 Due to the popularity of the game and the amount of press it has already gotten (not to mention that this review is super late), Im not going to spend much time dwelling on the mechanics and common knowledge of the game. Its a third-person action-adventure game with a heavy focus on story and characters and exploration (like I said earlier) and features inspiration from many popular games, such as The Last of Us, Tomb Raider, Dark Souls, and probably dozens of others that I haven't had the chance to play. What makes this game so great is that it takes some of the best elements from each of these franchises and mixes it all together to create its own cohesive experience. For example, the over-the-shoulder camera and basic movement is clearly inspired by Naughty Dogs The Last of Us. This was probably done because that particular style helps with immersion greatly without going into full-out first-person mode. You could also say that having a strong focus on story, especially with a parental figure and child, is also reminiscent of that game. Thats great, seeing as how the main reason that The Last of Us is popular is because of its story and characters. But for those who didn't like The Last of Us (those heartless bastards), calling this game Dad of Us: God of War Meets The Last of Us, you're doing the game a great disservice.

 While Im confident in saying that the game developers did take note from The Last of Us, its not the only inspiration they took. The core combat system, which is decidedly different from past games, seems to take a Dark Souls-esque approach. Dont take that the wrong way, its not a copy-and-paste approach, as there are still over-the-top moves you can perform (including some sick finishers and powerful runic attacks), but the base system of blocking with your shield and parrying when an enemy attacks to get an opening gives you that similar feeling. This is most prevalent in the early segments of the game when your character isn't upgraded fully and you don't have access to dozens of powerful moves and while I absolutely love decimating my foes with those attacks, the beginning parts makes you take a step back and be cautious with your fights  the first true boss fight of the game is probably the most difficult part of the story because of this fact. You cant just button-mash your way to victory (at least not on normal difficulty) and I appreciated that thought put into the combat. I should mention, however, that because the combat takes this route while also utilizing a similar camera to The Last of Us, it can feel a little clunky at times and hard to control, especially in the beginning when you're still getting used to everything, but after getting a couple hours into the game, you start to get the hang of it and it should be (mostly) smooth sailing from there on out  no camera in a game is perfect, but I still very much enjoyed the combat here. But then theres the exploration.

 The game seems to be a balance between linear and nonlinear, and I don't think that it is fair to label it as either of them. To say that the game is a nonlinear open-world game isn't completely true, as its certainly no Elder Scrolls or GTA in this regard, but to say that it is a linear game like Uncharted or the previous games is also unfair, as there are plenty of optional areas to explore on your journey. In this regard, I find it similar to metroidvania games and the newer Tomb Raider games. I only played the 2013 one, but its similar in that there is a linear path that you can take for the story, but there are plenty of side areas to explore to fill your time (although this game has far more content than Tomb Raider). While I almost always prefer linear games over nonlinear ones (for many reasons that I don't want to get into for the sake of time), I find that this game does a nice balance of staying in the middle. The main story is obviously the selling point of the game and certainly met my expectations, but the side content is jolly good fun as well, especially since you can learn more about the world you inhabit by exploring various landscapes and discovering secret areas and lore markers. That being said, however, I must offer one of my nitpicks of the game: the pacing.

 One of the best parts about a linear game is that by focusing on a single path for the player, it is (usually) more focused and can allow for a great experience that doesnt get old too quickly, i.e., it has really good pacing and means you don't get bored. By having this game be a little more open-ended you get the benefit of having more replay value on a single playthrough, more places to visit, and more customizable options for your characters because you do more, but you sacrifice something that I think is more important: the pacing. One minute, you're battling giant creatures and experiencing a riveting father-son tale with spectacular set pieces and beautiful subtle moments and the next, you're doing slightly repetitive side quests so that you can upgrade your equipment and learn more about the world. Now I understand that the keyword here is that it is optional content that no one is forcing you to do right away, but the game seems to deliberately encourage you to explore  thats how you get some of the best loot in the game and there are even moments where Atreus (your son) specifically says lines like We should go exploring now. I know that not everyone will feel this way and many would probably think that Im nitpicking what isn't even a flaw, but its just something that I thought should be stated because it honestly bugged me a bit in my playthrough. But that being said, it is a super nitpick and I would like to get to the other important aspect of the game now: the story.

 God of War is yet another fantastic example for the argument of why video games are the best medium for presenting a story. Directed by Cory Balrog, the game continues the cinematic approach of the earlier games  however, instead of using the cinematic framework to create over-the-top moments with some decent story bits sprinkled here and there, they use the framework to create a more natural experience where it really lets the player feel like they are truly embarking on journey. As I stated earlier, the camera is a lot closer to Kratos this time around and by not having any camera cuts in the game, you are part of every step of Kratos journey as he and his son travel to the highest peak so that they may spread their mothers ashes. Although the game has its grand moments that harken back to past games, the game is a lot more subdued in its approach as some of the best moments are just the little things you notice. Walking through the forest, Atreus might pose a question and Kratos response alone can provide more character depth than entire cutscenes in the past games, which is a tribute to the writing of this game. I do think that by having many people (including myself) compare this game to The Last of Us, you might create expectations for what the story should be and while I personally don't think that it is quite as good, it is still a beautiful journey from beginning to end that, while not featuring the greatest story or characters in a game, still features some of my favorite.

 Perhaps most shockingly, Kratos is great. Before this game, I was not a huge fan of him as I felt that he was just an angry dude who blamed everyone else for his problems, but this game makes you genuinely care about this man and his path to not only being a good father to Atreus, but also to redemption (even if he doesnt realize it). Then theres Atreus who is a great sidekick to have around. Since Im already making comparisons, I supposed I should mention that hes not a copy-and-paste of Ellie, but he is certainly likeable and also very useful in combat  I don't know where Id be without his magic arrows. Theres plenty of other great side characters, but I don't want to give them all away  needless to say, I think that all of them were fantastic. My two favorite were the main villain (who is perfect as the jackass who you cant help but love watching on-screen) and a character who appears halfway through the game to help provide you with some information  hes both funny and great at imparting knowledge to you and your son. All the actors perform exceptionally well, but I want to give particular mention to Christopher Judge. Some were hesitant that he was taking over the role of Kratos from long-time actor Terrence C. Carson, but he does a fantastic job. I won't comment on who is better, as I think they both fit their respective eras very well, but for representing all that Kratos is (a man with a dark a past, a mourning husband, a trying father, an unbelievably strong god, etc.), he is nothing short of fantastic.

 Since this review is getting a little longer than I was originally planning, I would like to mention a small detail that many (including myself at one point) asked: Is it necessary to play the past games? While the game is marketed as taking a fresh start of the series and was developed with that attitude, I think that it is important to mention that this is still the same Kratos and while it doesnt continue from the exact point that God of War III left off, it is a continuation of the story of Kratos. Not every question is answered, but there are more than a couple callbacks to Kratos past that Im not sure would be appreciated if you didn't play the previous games. However, that being said, I think that it would be interesting to play the game without this outside knowledge because then you would be more curious about some aspects and see certain situations through the eyes of Atreus (which director Cory Balrog has mentioned as being a perfectly suitable experience). So, I guess my answer would be if you have access to the previous games and want to play them, play them first; but if you're not interested and just want to play this game, just jump into this one (or watch YouTube summaries of the previous games and then play this one if you want).

God of War is a great game. Its not for everyone, but no game is. Some longtime fans might be upset at the new direction of the series, but I think that most would agree that it helped to not only create an amazing experience that will stay in many a gamers mind for a long time to come, but also in revitalizing a treasured Sony franchise. While the game does have its own self-contained story that reaches a downright beautiful ending (one of my favorites from any game ever), it also leaves enough open-ended questions to leave room for the inevitable sequel. I tried not to give too much away for the game so that you can experience most of it for yourself without having anything spoiled for you, but rest assured, it lived up to the hype for me and was easily worth my $60. I don't want to get hopes up because I know that that can lead to disappointment, but I do recommend you buy the game and try it out without any hype. See for yourself if it lives up. All I can say is that I cant wait to see where the series goes next, but until then, I will be happy to experience this one a second time. This may be the fourth main game in the series, but for many, it is only the beginning

5.0,False,"02 22, 2009",A2B40ERM3QI6E,B0012N5MIO,Campy,"I usually don't like, play, much less purchase fighting games. The last two fighting games I bought were Tekken 4 and Soul Calibur II, and of course, I bought them because they were pre-owned. Before that, I had bought at one point Mortal Kombat 1-3 for Genesis, and for some mysterious reason ( I can't remember right now how I got them) I had Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Samurai Showdown. I have never liked playing fighting games at the arcades.

If the picture isn't clear enough yet, fighting games are NOT my thing. At all. I usually suck at them, I usually can't figure how to perform any tricks or finishing moves, and quite honestly, they bore me. Notwithstanding, a while ago I had SF II HD Remix in front of me, and a need for brainless, reaction-induced fun rekindled a long lost nostalgia in me. I was hooked. I usually go for story heavy games, but sometimes you need to zone out, or zen in, and SFII did that for me. So, with the upcoming release of this little jewel right here, I was quite enthused. And I was delightfully surprised. Just the sheer fun factor of this game is well worth the sticker price.  The new aesthetic is odd at first, but it manages to keep within the realm of the beloved home brand. And it's just downright beautiful. I didn't dig much the anime intros, but that didn't detract from the overall experience for me. The music is a nice rockin' soundtrack you'd expect from Capcom. The sounds are pretty much a great evolution from the classic hadokens and shoryukens and whatnot. I haven't followed the series much, so I don't know how much the gameplay has evolved, but I am having loads of fun so far.

What struck me most about this title is the ability it has to make me feel as if I was playing it at the arcades, which I think has been the Holy Grail of fighting video games: to replicate the arcade experience.

GAMING
In regards to gaming, this is literally the best headset on the market for Xbox One owners. You all know the laundry list of gaming related features by now, but the two that I find most valuable is the bluetooth and sound quality. It's SO NICE to be able to pair this headset to your phone while you're gaming and either play your own music or even answer calls during gameplay. How many times has your friend/spouse/family member called you in the middle of an online match and you've had to ignore that call because you didn't feel like fumbling with all buttons necessary to answer that call? Well no more! And as for the sound...DTS 7.1 surround sound is ""so choice."" Enough said.

There have also been some reviews on here claiming that the mic is too quiet. While I cannot say whether those reviews are correct or not, my experience was anything but. My friend and I are heavy online gamers and both recently picked up the headset. We tested out every feature together and never noticed a significant dip in mic quality. Since there is no boom mic, you'll probably never be able to replace the quality you get from having a mic inches from your mouth, but the Elite 800X does a great job at eliminating the gaudy boom and holding serve to quality sounding game chat in my experience.

TV/MOVIES
For watching TV and movies, this headset fairs pretty well. Most likely not the greatest sound option compared to other devices/setups, but if you're like me and are a night-owl who likes to stay up late and watch TV but doesn't want to disturb the spouse/kids, then this headset will provide you with a great option for that with it's sound quality. There are multiple presets as well for different types of movies such as action, horror, drama, etc. but most of the time you're just better off using the Signature Sound preset.

MUSIC
The main reason I've been looking out for a headset is because I've wanted to have a quality sounding device for my music. The Elite 800X also has presets for the different types of music which is nice, but again I found myself using the Signature Sound preset most often. The headset is a little bigger (not heavier) than other popular headsets, but definitely has a premium look and feel to it. The leather padding on the ear cups are extremely comfortable and it really seals in the sound...I've tested this out a couple times with a friend to see if I could hear anything while they had the headset on full blast, but I couldn't hear a thing...very nice. No worries about disturbing your fellow humans at work, on the bus, etc. I mainly stream high quality music via Spotify, and really enjoyed the sound quality I got compared to other previous headsets/headphones.

In the end, as the title of this review states, you're going to pay a pretty penny for the Elite 800X. But if you game online with friends multiple times a week, and also want your headset to double as a good sound substitute for your music and movie consumption, then you'll find this headset extremely valuable and worth every penny.","""It is so choice.

They could easily update the roster and leave it at that, maybe alter a few things in story mode, but no each year they go above and beyond to try and create the best possible wrestling game out there, and truth be told they are second to none.

True this game features an updated roster but what makes it fun is the little details.  First and for most they made the choice of bringing back commentary and including for the first time voiceovers.  Now for anyone who played Just Bring It and Shut Your Mouth remember the commentary was horrendouse.  I like many wound up turning it off because it was just painful to listen too.  However they took a step in the right direction with this one in that the commentary is not repetitive (or as repetitive) and is actually somewhat fun to listen to.  The voice overs in some cases work out and in other cases don't.  Sadly in this case you can tell those who got into it and those who were reading the script.

The legends update was great in that now the legends actually come out to their theme (or a variation of it).  Biggest one being in my eye and I am sure for fans the return of Bret the Hitman Heart.  Sadly the legends (for those who lasted into the attitude era) don't have their titantrons or voiceovers.  Also the legends cannot be used in Story mode.

In terms of new matches there are only 2 this time around.  The Parking Lot Brawl is basicaly a Hardcore Match only the weapons are variouse vehicals surrounding you.  The other update is to the Elimination chamber where it is 6 man tag Elimination chamber.

The best adjustment was to the create a wrestler.  Now it is fairly easy (or not as time consuming) to get their attribute points up (I maxed out myself in about two trips through story mode which is about 6 hours of gameplay if your good).  You don't even have to control your creatd wrestler to give him attribute points as you buy them in shopzone ie. Wrestlemania X9 on gamecube and earn them by winning matches.

Finally outside of Online play the two newest features are Creating your own title belt that you can then defend online or on Create a PPV, yes Create a PPV is back and not nearly as tiem consuming to set up.  It even creates a little mini Movie for a buildup for your main event (in my case for my first PPV Bret Heart v. Shawn Michaels 3 stages of Hell).

Overall this is a great improvement over last year and is definetly worth the money.  This isn't just an updated roster like those other sprots games, this is a whole new step for the franchise.

The graphics are good, but having got a chance to play a level of Doom 3, it puts Halo to shame. Now I am waiting for Halo 2, which is going to match up to Doom 3.

However, in 1989 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Tecmo decided to change all of that by releasing the game Tecmo Bowl. With only 12 teams from each NFL cities, it made hours of fun and enjoyment, thanks to its replayability value and simple controls.

In 1991 and 1993, Tecmo, yet again released the same game, but with more to add to it by releasing this game to the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis. The modes in this game are awesome, and like the first game, the controls are simple and easy to understand. Plus, you can take your favorite NFL team to the Super Bowl and use the three-year option with playing the 1991, 1992 and 1993 schedules. Also, Pro Bowl and Coach modes are available and REAL NFL players and teams.

In conclusion, this is a wonderful game to have in your video game collection (as well as the first one) and trust me, this game will be very difficult to put the controller down. It is for everyone to enjoy and a great alternative to the repetitive Madden series, which EA Sports decides to keep the same gameplay and alter a graphics a little bit, every year.

In short, it improves on every aspect of the previous game.  You pretty much do the same things as before (pick your pet, pat/feed/stroke/play with your pet, teach it tricks, take it on walks, buy cute accessories, and of course, enter it into competitions).  Cats are also now in the equation, but they don't play a big role in the game versus your dog.

All in all the game is graphically sharper than its predecessor (I love the details of their fur, for example), the animals also seem more intuitive than the previous game and also their reactions to you seem more varied than before.  All in all it's a terrific game if you are an animal lover, and it's really perfect for kids.  I do agree with others here who say you should definitely tone down the 3D effect if you have young kids playing this game.

And speaking of the 3D, I think it's a nice touch.  It gives more depth to the background (much like other 3DS games), and it really shows when the animal hops on to you and licks you!  It definitely ups the ante on the ""cute"" factor of the game.  However, sometimes I did find myself getting disoriented when I rub or scratch my dog because the screen shakes and it sort of throws my line of sight away from the 3DS sweet spot.  For me personally, if I'm doing stuff that requires a lot of scratching, I usually turn off the 3D effect.  But for less stylus intensive things, I turn the 3D back on.  I love how the 3D gives added realism to my virtual pet!

If you get the 3DS, this (along with SF4, Ghost Recon and PES11) should definitely be part of your game library.",A Worthy Successor to the Original Nintendogs,1305072000,4,,

Activision was writing some stellar games for the Atari 2600, and Pitfall rates right up there with Space Invaders, Asteroids, Berzerk, and Missile Command as a ""must own"" for any Atari 2600 collector and/or player! First of all, the graphics were great, crisp, and clean. No background music, but plenty of sound effects to occupy your time as you ran, jumped, and collected through the jungle. Challenging as well, with many obstacles to jump over or avoid. Timing was another factor, to get over the pits that would appear beneath your feet.

You had 20 minutes to collect as much ""treasure"" as you could. Any time you hit a rolling log, points would be deducted from your score. And the only way to score was to collect the bounty littered on the jungle floor. This game was mesmerizing and addictive. I spent countless hours playing it, and can say I own this in my current Atari 2600 collection, one loose for playing, one complete in it's box with the original instructions.

I recommend this highly to all those that own an Atari 2600, and even those that are thinking about getting the old console, get this game for it.

5.0,True,"01 4, 2013",AVX1L42T98R8P,B007B7BI8S,Benjamin S. Sprague,"I'm not going to tell you anything you don't already know. Persona 4 Arena is a fighting game based on two of the arguably best Atlus rpgs of all time. (Unless you are a Nocturne, Digital Devil Saga, Devil Summoner, or  Persona 2 Innocent Sin purist) Like it or hate it, the Persona series has become Atlus's biggest franchise!

I'd be lying if I said I had doubts going in. Though Atlus can be accused of publishing some weird and outright awful drek on occasion, their in-house games are always effortless home-runs that knock the ball out of the park! During an era when most game companies are afraid to take risks and go so far as to equate screwing over customers as being the status quo, Atlus remains the belligerent yet noble hearted rebel with a cause giving a big middle finger to the establishment! Upon cracking open my P4 Arena case I was treated to yet another soundtrack cd and a beautiful full color manual in multiple languages. I keep waiting for Atlus to screw me over and treat me like an unworthy mongrel but as of right now they've continued to kill me with kindness!

To be frank I ""like"" fighting games. Like is in parenthesis because though it's not impossible to get me to play a round of Mortal Kombat, King Of Fighters 13, or Super Street Fighter 4 on occasion, I'm not a big part of the fighting game community. This generation both capcom and ASW have released countless rehashes of the same games with added features and if I were to try and keep up with all the iterations of Blazblue or SF 4 I'd be a penniless hobo in debt up to my eyeballs. There's simply something about being forced to purchase the same title over and over again with slight tweaks and small refinements that royally annoys me to no end.

Admittedly, I feel as if I'm taking a risk with P4 Arena. Atlus has a perfect reputation with me but ASW has been in the dog house ever since I bought the original Blazblue followed by Continuum shift and STILL didn't end up with the very best version of that game. (Extend is the 3rd installment of Blazblue and I wish I had been more patient as opposed to buying its` two inferior predecessors) Will I be ""betrayed"" later when 2 or more superior versions of P4 Arena release in the future? Only time will tell but hopefully ASW has learned its' lesson. (I wouldn't mind a legitimate ""sequel"" to P4 Arena. I simply don't want to endure the same rehashed plot-line over and over again as a couple of new characters get tacked on here or there. Aka, give me a ""new story"" and enough ""new features' to make me excited again!)

Yet for the moment, let me judge P4 Arena on its' own merits! Put simply, this is a  complex fighter that looks gorgeous and actually offers accessibility for beginners by creating an option for easy input commands. ""Fighting game enthusiasts"" may hate this feature but fortunately there is the option to set up your own conditions when you start up a room or search online for potential opponents.

Air dashes, back steps, cancels, hops, counters, combos, sweeps, throws, recoveries, and ridiculously over powered finishing moves are all here. (With enough devotion and practice you can become seasoned enough to easily overcome the novices throwing cheap auto-combo chains at you.)  The biggest difference is you can now call in a persona as a tag team partner of sorts. Both the protagonists and their epic alter egos have a fierce and normal attack. ""Personas"" can sustain damage and be taken out of commission during bouts so this adds to the strategy. You must be meticulous and thoughtful when it comes to busting out the swag! Additionally, characters can even suffer from ""status ailments"" akin to a traditional rpg. These include being drained of sp (magic required to do certain special techniques), having your controls reversed, and being poisoned as your health bar slowly but gradually dwindles.

The voice acting, background arenas, character designs, and layout of the menus are all impressive but I figured Atlus would soar in these areas in the first place! My faith was not misplaced. From what I can tell, Chie and Teddy got new VAs and at least in my opinion they did a fantastic job. Even Labrys's distinctive Jersey accent ""fit"" with her character. (I felt no need to make wise cracks about Jersey shore!)

The story brings together characters from P3 and P4 and does it in such a way it actually makes sense and feels 100% natural. Luckily for us, this isn't a poorly done set up just to get a bunch of best friends to beat the crap out of each other.

Ironically, my biggest qualm is that the standard story mode is more wordy than it has to be. (This coming from the guy who is a staunch advocator of including decent character development and believable motivations within fighting games) You'll have to endure reading pages upon pages of inner monologue before the characters actually say anything to each other. I felt as if this ""padding"" was unnecessary. However, if you're more patient with visual novels than I am, you'll be right at home! The arcade mode gave out enough tidbits to make the narrative interesting yet it also moved on at a brisk refreshing pace. I found it to be more enjoyable myself.

It's difficult to say whether or not these 13 young pugilists will appeal to your tastes. There's everything from missile-rack totting android girls (Aigis) and fan wielding inn hostesses (Yukiko) to otherworldly entities zipped up in mascot costumes (Teddie). Luckily, the traditional archetypes are also represented. Mitsuru has a lethal and forceful fencer style, Yu takes cues from his samurai ancestry,  Yosuke is the quick double blade wielding wage-slave ninja , and Akihiko, Chie, and Kanji fill in for the traditional brawler types. Naoto uses a hand gun but she's also decent at some rather impressive rush down aerial crescent kicks as well as utilizing her persona for close up piercing attacks. Though the roster sits in at a mere 13 characters , every demographic seems accounted for. (Still, if you feel uncomfortable around the zany awkwardness of personas, teenaged supernatural investigators, fem-bots, and mysterious inner dimensional television portals, perhaps a traditional fighter such as KOF 13 would be more attuned to your preferences.)

Though P4 Arena is not apart of one of my more favored genres (those being rpgs,action platformers,survival horror, and beat em ups), it's still a classy package! Whether you're a Persona fan or someone who enjoys eclectic fighters such as Dark Stalkers, Rival Schools, and Jo Jo's bizarre adventure, I highly recommended this purchase!

Pros

+Characters are varied and look great (And are faithful recreations of their rpg counterparts)

+Gameplay is easy to pick up but hard to master

+ Askys went to great lengths to make the game accessible for everyone

+ Catchy soundtrack

+ Storyline that makes logical sense within the continuity of the Shin Megami Tensei Persona universe

+Stellar VA work

+Great menu design

+Mitsuru in a skintight spy suit. Yeah baby! I just hope her fur coat isn't all that's left of poor Koromaru!

Cons

-At 13 characters the roster is on the small side

-We're left to wonder if ASW is going to milk P4 Arena dry with an unnecessarily high number of  revisions and reiterations (P4 ARENA SUPER EXTEND ONYX NYX EDITION TURBO!)

-Story ends on a deliberate cliff-hanger (Such and such is being controlled by a mysterious UNKNOWN POWAH! Oh, how original Atlus. C`mon, you can do better than that!)

-A part of me thinks this would have been a better co-op beat em up/rpg hybrid in the same vein as Code Princess and Dragon Crown

-Story mode is probably more longwinded than it needs to be (Don't get me wrong! I'm grateful there is an actual narrative. Yet the text screens have the tendency to linger and ramble on whilst overstaying their  welcome)

-Certain traditionalists maybe a little disheartened P4 Arena has a 4 button layout as opposed to the 6-8 button layouts found in other fighting games.

5 out of 5

A 5 out of 5 means the people who made this game did so with love and care. While I can bag on P4 Arena for not being my favorite kind of game or bag on it for being trite fan service, the truth is that it excels in both its' technical and visual presentation.

It was a smart decision to make P4 Arena a 2D Brawler as it really enhances the charm and personality of the beloved cast of characters we've gotten to know from Persona 3 and Persona 4.

As much as I've ranted angrily about ASW for their capcom inspired business practices they are skilled and adept at making good fighting games. P4 Arena is no exception!

Sure, I'll probably be outraged when ASW announces P4 Arena Nyx Black Diamond edition and P4 Arena Blue Sapphire Jack Frost edition but for now I rather push that negative premonition aside to dwell in the realm of my warm fuzzy nostalgia!",A fan tribute worthy of the platinum label!,1357257600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,True,"04 20, 2011",A1YK0KOUJBHGR1,B000ZJVDA2,MDI,"Overall i'd give this game a 100/100 but there are those minor blemishes and load times can be a major drag. If you install it to your 360's hdd though, these load times seemingly just dissapear which makes it much more bearable. In summary, if you want a fun turnbased rpg that has no actual forced grinding, loads of content, and also has tons of exploration pick it up. The visuals are also simply amazing. You'll not be making a wrong mistake. The game took me ~70hrs to beat, and I enjoyed almost every minute of it. 96/100. For someone who wants to do everything, you could probably easily spend upwards of 100hrs playing it through. To read more a more detailed review scroll down and read the rest of it.

I'll be dividing up my review of the game both positive and negative to the discs themselves. The game is four discs in total so I think that this is the best way to do this.

The first disc as stated throws you into the action. You are instantly in the fight, with little knowledge of what is going on beyond that you are to fight. As the action picks up, you continually keep on advancing through it. Later on you meet others, each character is slowly introduced to you so that you know where you are going and what you are meant to do. The score of this part of the game is very delightful but not the best that I have ever heard for that belongs for the final disc. The only downside that i can say about this part of the game is that the action takes a little while to go into overdrive. I'd give it a 90/100 for the time that it takes for the action and storytelling to really startup.

The next disc is where the game has a bit more things wrong with it. It has one section wherein your are sent to do pointless 'fetch quests' this is the only part of the game that does this. And i don't know why it's doing this. There is no reason for them do this, it could've been done via a cutscene and thus saved me and anyone else playing it from having to waste our time at this pointless activity. The emotional tone of the game also takes a much more serious theme during this disc and sets yourself up for the rest of the game. Overall this is a much better experience than the first disc except for that minor blemish. It continues on and sets you up for your first dungeons which are filled with puzzles and lots of areas to explore. With multiple paths to follow. I'd give this section a 95/100 a minor blemish but overall the more freedom to do things in this disc really helps the game overall.

The third disc is probably the longest of them all. Everything is really fun, and over the top enjoyable. But with every goodside there is a downside. It is the first time that the agme requires you to split up your party, I don't know about how others play but i personally did not keep all of my party up to par and thus i found this one section very frustating. The dungeon design in this part of the game are much more complex than they were previously and the story really picks up really well. The characters finally have their feeling and emotions completely fleshed out whereas before you knew who they were and what they were doing but they still had not been, to me anyway, completely fleshed out into living breathing people. The gameplay continues on and you find many goodies for exploring the world. There is not a single 'sidequest' as people call them that wastes your time without giving you some type of reward. Exploring the game world gives you tons of interesting items and rewards you for playing properly.

And now we are onto the fourth disc, adn thus the end of the game. This one can be a lot shorter than the rest if you rush it. But if you are like me, and like to explore the world. You will find many new dungeons that are really large and provide a lot of enjoyment. Most of the dungeons in this part of the game that you can do that are not part of the main game take upwards of four to five hours minimum. You will find new bosses to face at each one along with more story for each character. The strategies for each vary so you'll have to be ready to change up your fighting stance as you go along. Also the bosses in this section at the start set you up for the tone of the rest of this disc. It is no 'cake walk' so to speak, because you will always have a challenge unless you are someone who likes to 'grind' their way through levels by randomly spending them grinding. As it finally comes to a close, the cinematics are amazing and the overall feel of the game is simply mind-boggling.",Some Minor Quirks but overall a very good game and definately worth a play.,1303257600,2,,

The first couple of days trying to play this beast was, well, frustrating to say the least.  I got killed, then got killed again, and then got killed some more.  It drove me insane.

After learning that you can parry in this game, it is now pretty simple.

I think that most folks that pick this game up and give it poor reviews are ones that like to play 'run and gun' style.  This game will punish you for this type of play.  You have to slow down, learn the characters moves and then die, a bunch of times.  After a while, it gets pretty easy.  You know exactly when to parry and get a gruesome visceral attack, or back stab.

Dodge is your friend.  Don't be greedy.  Slash, slash, dodge, parry, visceral, repeat.  Also, level up!  Grind them baddies.  I'll go through the first level a dozen times before I get start really playing.  Quick way to get Echoes.

Explore the areas.  The design does seem like it is setting you on a certain course, but, look around.  Creep around buildings or alleys and find out if their is a secret hiding behind some crates or barrels.

This game is fun, frustrating, but fun.  After you level up and level your weapons up, you'll cut through the baddies like a hot knife through butter.

This was one of my favorite games in recent memory. What happens when you take the brilliance of Parker and Stone and pair it with the masterful skill of Obsidian Entertainment? This game.

This is an RPG that features a more old school style combat system, where timing is as important as upgrades and buffs. Speaking of RPG, it in itself is simple and yet maximizes what it intended to accomplish, and your guy will be a bad ### by the end of the game. Speaking of your guy, if you DON'T name him """", you aren't doing things properly, lol

Anyway, playing through this game is basically like playing through an entire season of the TV show itself, with all the twists and turns a season might take. The town of South Park and all its inhabitants show up and are presented perfectly. The plot itself is also fairly well perfect, and I dare say that even if you aren't a fan of the show, you will still love this game.

For me, this was easily a 10 out of 10. Cant recommend this one highly enough really.

It's also worth noting that this game has a ton of replay value, not only for all the copious Easter Eggs, but also because the second playthrough will allow you choices that perhaps weren't available the first time around, and will also allow you to take different paths in the game as well (story choices, interactions, etc...) that have different consequences.",One of the great games of all time,1429401600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

But SF2 was an over night smash back in 1992,1993 or so.. I loved the original, I loved hyper edition, but this Super edition was by far my favorite. But this was the last interest I had with Street Fighter games. There was far too many versions coming out, and I didn't like the animie graphics. But still to this day this is my fav. SF game in the world. Introducing 4 new charactors, Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long and Thunder Hawk. With new an improved sound and graphics and a few new moves. Re drawn backgrounds and cool options. The only thing that was missing was Vega no longer lept on to the cage in his stage, he just bounced of the wall, and a couple of the moves where changed slightly, like Chun Li's blue fart ball was changed into a back flip bubble, and executed differently, and the airiel moves didn't span accross the screen anymore, unless you jumped in that direction.. but it still didn't take away the hours of fun beating the #!@% out of your friends and fire blalling your way to victory.

This game has since been revived on the Gameboy advance. They have pretty much used the SSF2Turbo edition, that has combos and sort of finisher/special move things.

Throughout the campaign, you will amass an arenal of leathal firearms and expand your transportation with a plethora of performace cars, heavy freight trucks and fire engines as well as motercycles capable of reaching relative speeds in excess of 185 mph (provided you don't meet your fate in a head on collision with a dumptruck).
Firstly, I want to give praise to the designers behind the vehicle performace engine.  Each car is unique with its own areas of high performance and limitations.  Accelleration and braking are handled in a realistic manner and with the handbrake (controlled with (B) on Xbox) you can now drift around hairpin turns with ease.  Just try and avoid the newstand.  Your car will never run out of gas however, when engaging in car battle, be sure to jump into a beefy muscle car or heavy truck unless you want to find yourself downrange of a police blockade or vengful mob of Vicerorys.  NCPs can and will ram/shoot your vehicle until it is disabled.  Carjacking is another option in desperate straits but will often prompt citizens to report you to the authorities which results in a highspeed chase and disaster or escape.  Once you have evaded your pursuers, hop on the freeway and speed out of the district or pull into a back alley garage, kill the lights and wait for them to return to HQ (this takes a little as a few seconds of skimming the streets to several minutes of detail combing of any and every alley way depeding on your current wanted level.  Unfortunatly, you cannot exchange gunfire with agressors from your vehicle but you can raise one of the cities many drawbridges, race over it at the last second, leaving your pursuers to find an alternate route.  Drawbridges are especially thrilling while astride the Sayanora LE, the games fastest and most powerful motercycle.  Boats patrol the waterways of Chicago and don't heistate to jump on board one and make your way out of the city to Lighthouse island or the backwaters of Pawnee.  No, waverunners are not present.
Combat functions like most any shooter game.  LT to aim, RT to fire, all in third person though.  Once you have felled a gunman, don't turn you back just yet, he may get up and keep shooting, especially if he is an armored elite or an Enforcer (hulking juggernaughts best taken out with a grenade launcher or an IED stuck to their back).  Many different firearms are available for purchase at gun shops or you can loot them off you enemies.  Purchse, pick up and fire anything from SMGs to 50 BMG snipers to four shot pump action grenade launchers.  The choices are nearly endless.
Mutiplayer, though fun leaves a bit to be desired.  Options include hiding and hacking other players for noteriety points.  Tailing them unoticed or engaing in four man races through the streets of Chicago in a wide range of vehicles.  Ubisoft released two additional multiplayer options for the PC and next gens but not for the older consoles.

Now the home version has arrived, and fans of the arcade model will love it.
Like most gun games, there is a plot: you are a top secret agent who must track down the criminal syndicate bent on launching a reprogrammed satellite into orbit.  Unlike most gun games, there is a large number of cut scenes that keep the story moving along without seriously affecting game play.  Most shooting games save the cut scenes for boss battles, where CM sprinkles them throughout the game.
Also throughout the game you'll run across ""mini-games"" of sorts, where you have to use some special gadget to escape a trap or pursue your enemies.  Succeed, and the story continues ... fail, and you may have your work cut out for you to get back on track.  While hardly new to shooting games in general (and Sega shooters in particular, with House of the Dead and Lost World leading the way), these events are new to the Virtua Cop line.  (While there is no direct connection story-wise to Virtua Cop, most people consider this game to be VC3 in spy gear ... a compliment, to be sure.)
I won't spend too much time on the graphics and sound ... in true Sega style, they match the arcade system almost exactly.  Load time is practically non-existant.
As Sega knows all too well, an arcade-to-home port needs a lot of bonus goodies to bring in the sales.  Crazy Taxi had its Crazy Box, Virtua Tennis its World Circuit ... Confidential Mission is no exception.  Along with several training mini-games and a two-player ranking system that measures how well you and your cohort work together, you can unlock the Dreamcast mode (same game levels, but enemies now appear in different locations) or special gameplay options like no screen displays or level selects.
As Sega chose not to produce its own light gun for the Dreamcast, you're on your own to find one that works for you.  Supported controllers include the standard pad, the Arcade Stick and the third-party light guns.
Okay, you've got a first-class conversion and lots of new features ... what more could you ask for?  How about an incredibly low price!

For me growing up on FF on NES then moving onto more fleshed out games like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 2 & 3 this game hearkens back to an age where digital storytelling is told with sprites and a masterful soundtrack. Although the graphics and the way your characters move about the map is very 'dated' by most standards the challenging game play and character interaction makes up for any modern downfalls.

I do wish they would have left in the raw Japanese.

It is still compatible with most modern televisions thanks to its S-Video capability. The console is a classic, but also has so many hidden gems, you can really go to its Wikipedia article and start to drool. Further, with its VMU capability and four ports for controllers it has aged much better than other retro consoles.
Games to get with this:
Sonic Adventure 1 and 2: Two classic 3D platformers, though 2 has aged much better than 1. They can still be found affordably and playing them on their original console (Dreamcast) gives the best control experience.

D2: An obscure horror game that will have you hiding under your bed at night for weeks after playing it. This game made great and novel use of the VMU screen

Shenmue: Considered one of the best games ever made, with graphics that hold up well even today

Chu Chu Rocket: Great puzzle game, with a competitive multiplayer mode for up to four local players

Space Channel 5: A music game that has you helping a space news reporter (you heard me) dance. Very bizarre, very fun.

Crazy Taxi: I cannot do this game justice in my writing. Just go look up Crazy Taxi gameplay online.

And so many more.

For those who don't know, Halo Wars is an RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game where you control multiple units from a third-person perspective. You can create bases, build units, move them, and fight with them! The controls are very easy to learn with the tutorials. I highly recommend playing both tutorials (Regular & Advanced) before you play campaign or skirmish. THIS IS A NO SPOILER REVIEW!!!

Campaign:

This is a very fun and enjoyable campaign! I haven't done the entire thing yet, but I am almost done. The story is great, and it is easy to know what your objective is. Aside from the requirements for the mission in general, there are fairly easy side objectives that can be completed in the mission. There are 15 missions in the campaign, each taking approximately 15-20 minutes each. I had trouble with 2 of the missions, but I looked up online a good strategy. There is a co-op mode for the campaign, which makes hard missions a lot easier (especially if that friend is very good at the game). So overall, the campaign is very fun.

Skirmish:

Skirmish is a mode where you can play different game modes with different leaders from the UNSC and the Covenant. You can do 1-1, 2-2, and 3-3 games. You can either play by yourself or with your friends against AI enemies. There are 3 UNSC leaders and 3 Covenant leaders, each having different abilities and unique units. With the UNSC, your leader is NOT a general unit. With the Covenant, you can fight with and control your leader. There are tons of maps to choose from! There are 2 DLC packs, but I don't think they're worth buying. They just add a few extra maps. So overall, the skirmish mode is very fun.

Multiplayer:

Multiplayer is also very fun. You can do the same modes as Skirmish, but just on Xbox LIVE.I generally like the 1-1 matches better because if you're doing 2-2 or 3-3, if one player drops out on your team, it greatly decreases your chance for success. There is a rank-up system in Multiplayer as well. The only problem is that only about 5,000 people play multiplayer, so it's really hard to find a match unless you have lots of friends. So I haven't played multiplayer as much.

Overall:

Halo Wars is a great RTS that is fun to play and easy to learn how to play. All of the modes are very fun, but I prefer Skirmish over any other. The price is very good on Amazon, and it is very fun to play with a friend. I would highly recommend this to any Halo fan or any RTS fan in general.",Excellent Console RTS!,1320451200,,,

Skylar,"Pikmin 3 is a worthwhile re-release for Nintendo if just for the reason that the game went out of print and sold for outrageous prices on Ebay. l'm not a massive Pikmin fan. I played the original for Gamecube upon it's release but haven't played another Pikmin title since. It's been over 12 years since l played the game. l was much younger back then, but it left a lasting impression on me. l kept reading and hearing about Pikmin 3 for quite some time on Top/best Wii U games list and decided l'd like to revisit the franchise. One problem, the game was incredibly hard to find and Ebay sellers want their money, so l passed.

With these ""Nintendo Selects"" titles l can find an affordable copy of Pikmin 3 and the opportunity to see what l've been missing out on. Nintendo Selects offers good games at a great price, but Pikmin and Captain Olimar were at the top of my list. The premise of the game is just like the first two entries. You play as 3 different aliens from famished planet Koppai looking for nourrishment resources for your species. Your ship lands on an undiscovered planet where you met strange creatures known as Pikmin. These cute, colourful beings take a liking to you and will help you by solve puzzles and fighting.

There are different coloured Pikmin with different abilities. For instance, red Pikmin are stronger in combat, the blue kind can walk on water, and the yellow type are good against electricity. Like it's predecessor Pikmin 2, 3 adds more types of Pikmin with different powers. This time we get rock and flying Pikmin who add a new dimension to the game.

Did l say the game was unique? The environments, the feel of the game, it's characters and visuals are unlike any other game l've played previously. It's a unique concept where you solve puzzle, and a very entertaining one at that. If you've played a Pikmin game before it will instantly feel familiar, like an old friend you haven't seen in a long time comes by to visit. The HD visuals are nothing short of incredible. Pikmin always had interesting visuals, but the experience Pikmin 3 provides is a feast for the eyes. I will say that l do miss playing as Captain Olimar from the first two games, but that's as far as my criticism goes.

To be fair, it's not all that different from the original Pikmin, but it plays very differently. The Wii U's gamepad and is used beautifully all throughout to provide fluid controls. There's hardly button wasted or unused on the controller. The game makes you tap the screen, use the stylus, use the L, R, ZL, ZR buttons and joystick. For that reason alone it deserves credit. What's interesting is characters in the game have devices similar to the Wii U's gamepad called KopPad that is used to take pictures, view menus and maps. The game also allows the played to use a number of options for play: the gamepad, pro controller or the Wiimote plus /nunchuk combination.

Why is Pikmin a worthwile game? Because there's been nothing quite like it since it came out and it fills the void for a certain type of games on the Wii U. To be fair l was a little too young when l played the original, and although it looked like no other game l have seen since, there was no way l couldn't truly enjoy it. I might just revisit the first two games in the franchise as a result of my experience. 5/5*",Worthwile re-release of a unique gaming experience,1458086400,14,,

This title is a MUST HAVE for any Wii U owner. I'll go into detail, but the game basically allows you to create your own Mario levels using the Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, New Super Mario Bros. U and Super Mario World engines. You can share your creations online for others to play, or completely dedicate your experience with this game to playing other people's creations.

I personally get a kick out of every aspect of this game. I love creating levels, playing other people's levels, and leaving comments for others to share my thoughts of their creations. The possibilities are endless, and you are rewarded for playing the game with more level creation tools that can enhance your ""maker"" abilities. Different backdrops are available for you to unlock, so making an underwater level with the New Super Mario Bros. U engine is totally possible, for example. The interface takes some getting used to, but after messing around creating levels, playing levels, searching for levels and leaving comments and stars (basically likes) for others is simple. Levels you upload are given a respective course code that others can enter to find your specific course, and they can also look up your NNID to find all of your creations. If you thought the game ended there, think again. There are other modes like the 100 Mario Challenge where you are put up against random levels created by others that you have to beat with 100 lives. I'll tell you, it's harder than you think. Along with that is the 10 Mario Challenge which leverages pre-made courses that are a tad easier most of the time.

Don't even get me started with the amiibo functionality. Pretty much every amiibo out has content for you in Super Mario Maker. I'm an amiibo collector, so finding out that scanning my Silver Mario amiibo can create a power up that turns you into Silver Mario instantly opened up a world of interesting possibilities for creating levels. I've seen Pokemon themed levels (you can scan in every Pokemon amiibo and that allows you to play as that character, along with every other amiibo) , Animal Crossing themed levels, even levels that are Sonic the Hedgehog themed. The amiibo functionality adds a whole new dimension to your creations and a whole new level of fun.

To conclude here, if you're a fan of Mario both new and old GET THIS GAME. You'll be having new Mario experiences for as long as this game lets you share and play other's creations. Add me as well (djlewswerve is my NNID), I'd love to share and play other creations!",The game that encompasses what Nintendo is all about: creativity.,1448841600,,,

This is a very challenging game, though there are plenty of in-game options and items available to prevent frustration.  And it looks better than ever, with all the foreground and background elements really popping in 3D.

Someone had challenged that claim with the Logitech Coreless Action Controller.  I was able to use it for a day and I was quite impressed.  Here is how they compared:

Feel & Style:

>Arsenal - Feels like a traditional controller, fills your hands and the rubber grips makes for a comfortable grip.  A little congested near the Start/Select buttons but is surprisingly light for a wireless.  The sensor that plugs in your PS2 is a little large; extending passed your memory card.

>Logitech - It has a unique design which feels a little awkward to me.  It has a lot of curves which contour to your hands but not comfortably.  It has a nice compact sensor which is flush with your card.  The material which is made of looks a little sturdier than the Falcon.  I wasn't about to do the drop test with either controller but if it's anything like a standard PS2 controller that would be great. (I dropped one 4 times before it finally stopped working).  It was noticeably heavier than the featherweight Falcon.

Response and Functionality:

>Arsenal - I found no problems with the sticks but the button pressure felt a little worn down.  I bought this used so that may have had something to do with it.  It has not impacted my game play but does take a little getting use to.  The gamepad has a turbo function and a programming feature.  You are able the input a combination of movements and button presses that can be recalled with a single button press.  You can be the judge to see if that is a useful feature or not.

>Logitech - Both these controllers have a solid face D-pad and an auto shut-off feature.  With the Logitech you can turn-off the vibration feature, which can extend the life of your batteries.  The response of this controller is exactly like a standard wire controller with no notable flaws.

Bottom line:

Since I was so impressed by the controller I was compelled to write this review and give credit where credit is due.  I still like the feel of the Falcon and the extra features are a good touch for gamers who are willing to use them.  Other than my personal comment of the grip, the Logitech had 0 problems.  Logitech is also a known supplier of fine CPU gamepads and joysticks.  Last but not least it has the all mighty PS seal of approval.",How it compared to my Falcon,1176940800,,,

Content Description: The Half Life 2 Series

Half Life 2, Half Life 2 Episode One, and Half Life 2 Episode 2 follow the further adventures of Gordon Freeman, the hero of Half Life.  Freeman, former physicist at the top secret Black Mesa research facility, had saved the world at the end of Half Life, only to be rewarded with an offer he couldn't refuse.  Half Life 2 picks up over a decade later, with humanity under the boot heel of the Combine.  The original Half Life broke new ground with both its graphics and its strong story.  Half Life 2 carries on in the tradition of gritty realism and compelling storyline.

One of the strengths of Half Life 2 and Episodes One and Two is that the game is kind to middle-aged eyesight and reflexes.  Although the game is a shooter, the ability to solve puzzles is more important than twitchy reflexes.  Valve is well known for training players in the kinds of skills and awareness they will need for overcoming the challenges they will meet, after which players will then need to apply the concepts to new situations.  This is why Half Life 2's gameplay is, in many ways, more fun than that of the original.  The original game included several jump puzzles that required exquisite timing and twitchy reflexes in order to complete them successfully.  Half Life 2 asks players to look more carefully at their environment.

The Half Life 2 series also builds incrementally upon gameplay and game engine.  Episode Two, for example, is graphically more advanced than that of Half Life 2.  Outdoor textures are better rendered, and the level design is more sophisticated with respect to collisions and pathing.  While still largely linear, the levels are less obviously scripted for the player to go in one and only one direction.  The illusion of exploration is much stronger.  Additionally, the new Achievements invite replay that rewards players for trying new approaches.  Also, while Half Life 2 itself involves significantly more interaction with NPCs than does Half Life, Episodes One and Two give Freeman an interesting sidekick, Alyx Vance.

Both Episode One and Two are shorter than a standard game, but the addition of Achievements will do much to encourage replay.  With respect to narrative, however, it would be difficult to make them longer.  Episode One suffers from the same issues that plague middle books in series: the problem of balancing a discrete story within a larger arc.  Episode One is about the flight from City 17.  Episode Two is about reuniting with the Black Mesa scientists in hiding.  Each ends logically, but the endings also propel the story into the next episode.  Sadly, given Valve development schedules, we will probably have to wait at least two years before we tie up the Half Life 2 story.

Practically Perfect: Half Life 2 and its Episodes

The ""practically perfect"" designation comes from the inclusion of both Half Life 2 and Episode One.  Half Life is a well-known franchise, and a significant number of players picking up the Orange Box will already own these two games.  This leaves the player with two games extra.  Luckily, Valve allows players to give extra copies as gifts.  Of course, given the strength of the games, the recipients will likely wish to pick up Episode Two, which will probably mean a purchase of The Orange Box--the most economical package should players wish more than one game from this collection.  Of course, this means the package is perfect from the point of view of selling more copies, but it's less than perfect for the player who already owns one of the Half Life 2 titles.

Portal: Aperture Science

Portal is a fun puzzle game.  In a departure from the shooter genre, the player takes the role of Chell, a female test subject at the Aperture Science Enrichment Center.  Using a portal gun, the player navigates her way through a series of increasingly difficult puzzle mazes.  Coaching the player through the game is GladOS, the central computer, whose neurotic personality is both touchingly needy and disturbingly manipulative.  GladOS's comments provide a narrative frame to the puzzle sequence, and subtly set up one of the most darkly humorous and twistedly funny ending credits of any game.  Outside of the loose narrative frame, the puzzles are another tribute to Valve level design.  It's possible to feel smarter as a result of solving the different mazes.  As with the other games in The Orange Box, Portal includes several Achievements, some of which can be unlocked as a result of normal play experience, and some that will be unlocked through replay of specific parts of the game.  This kind of game mechanic invites replayability.

Team Fortress 2: Murderously Merry Mayhem

Team Fortress 2 is the multiplayer component of the package.  A team-based shooter, TF2 breaks from the realism of Half Life 2 and of other team shooters, opting instead to use cartoon graphics.  The result is a fun team game that's immediately accessible to a large demographic.

The game asks players to take one of several distinct team roles: medic, heavy weapons guy, pyro, spy, engineer, demoman, soldier, scout.  Each role has a clear place on the team; for example, the spy infiltrates the enemy from within while the heavy weapons guy tanks.  Playing the role on a team, though, reveals the depth of the tactics involved.  The game features built-in voice support, so it's advantageous to have a headset and mic.  Players also have the option to respawn in different roles, depending on the team's need.

TF2 makes good use of the Steam Community social networking infrastructure.  Once players start to frequent the same servers and develop a network of ""favorites,"" different TF2 groups will start to invite the player to join them and will add the player to their Friends list.  Much of the appeal of the online game lies in the ability to find like-minded players, and TF2's integration into Steam allows this kind of social grouping to occur naturally and easily.  Would that MMOs develop this kind of mechanic!

Steam: A Blessing and a Curse

It's impossible to review The Orange Box without mentioning Steam, Valve's content delivery system.  In order to play Valve games, players must install Steam, which runs in the background of the player's computer.  Thus, in a very real sense, when people purchase The Orange Box, they're also buying into Steam.  Steam auto-updates the games, which is nice in that patching is seamless.  Steam also is a vital component of the Steam Community, the social networking aspect of Valve players.  Think myspace for gamers, and you have a good approximation of the utility of the Steam Community.

However, for all its good qualities, Steam does have a dark side.  Outside of using system resources, Steam requires an internet connection.  If, like me, you want to take your computer with you on the holidays but you don't have reliable internet, you won't be able to play even the single player games of Half Life 2, Episode One, and Episode Two.

One interesting tidbit is that Steam will gather system information, although it will ask permission to use it.  This information is used by Valve developers (and presumably others) to gauge the technology of current gamers.  If you're tired of having to upgrade your computer to the newest and fastest, you'll be grateful to Valve for gathering real user information on a regular basis.  Valve makes games for the machines we own.  Unlike some other developers, Valve avoids games that bring even the bleeding edge rigs to their knees.

Overall Assessment:  A Very Nice Package for the Gamer in Your Life

Whether you're looking for yourself or for a gamer friend or relative, The Orange Box delivers on its promise of hours of great game play.  Valve spends a lot of time in development, and the quality of its product reflects the care involved.

Simply put, the PSP is an amazing device - it has crystal clear clarity for movies, flash memory for MP3s, and a large assortment of FUN games (as opposed to the DS - but I will touch more on that later). Really, what more could you want?

  I don't mean to trash the Nintendo DS ( I have them both), but they clearly are not in same league. This is probably partially by design - the Nintendo DS (Judging by its assortment of games) is designed for kids under the age of 12. With the exception of Super Mario 64 - I have yet to find one game that I enjoy. The PSP already has a much better selection of games, and games that adults actually want to play - notice there is not a ""Madagascar"" for the PSP. The PSP is designed to be a total entertainment device.

  Here are some comparisons and pros and cons-

Graphics-

  PSP 5 out of 5 - really they are as good as you could ever expect

  DS- 5 out of 5 - maybe a shade worse than the PSP- but still very good

Sound -

PSP - 4 out of 5 Has issues with volume (you almost have to wear the headphones) - but plenty of options for tweaking the set-up

DS - 4 out 5 also a little problem with volume , but not bad

Load TImes

PSP-  2.5 out 5 - clearly this is where the PSP underperforms the DS. The Nintendo DS uses a flash type memory compared to the PSP's optical read. There is a large difference between the two.

DS-  5 out of 5 - The Flash memory is much faster

Games -

PSP-  4 out of 5 - an already large selection and growing by the day. HUGE advantage over the DS

DS- 1.5 out of 5 in my opinion- it only has 1 good game. Supposedely there will be a metroid game released, but I have been waiting for 8 months.

Features-

PSP- Another HUGE advantage over the DS... here is a list of thing you can do on the PSP that you can NOT do on the DS

-  Watch/rent movies

-  Listen to MP3s off of a flash media card (Much like an ipod)

-  view pictures off of your digital camera (or Sony Digital camera at least)

Things you can do on the DS that you can NOT do on the PSP

 - draw pictures using a stylus

ADVANTAGE - PSP

  Tip: Be VERY careful of the PSP screen not to get it scratched. I can see no easy way of replacing it, and to severely scratch it would be horrible.

I just recently played it again and loved every minute of it. This game has an amazing story that kept my attention the whole way through. The battle system is also very unique. Instead of slashing away with a sword, Altair uses grace and elegance to kill his foes. Counter attacks, combos, breaking through your enemies defense, throwing knives, and assassinating with a hidden blade are the main ways to kill in this game.

Instead of forcing you to be sneaky like some games do, you have a choice to be as sneaky as you want and won't have consequences later. The is about a war between Assassins and Templars that started long ago and still continues today. Both sides want world peace but go about obtaining it in different ways. Templars want to force it on people while the Assassins think it should be a choice. The main character, Altair, is sent to kill 9 people who are considered horrible people (corrupt merchants, slave trader, etc).

For a game that starts out very easy it gets a bit challenging towards the end. You really need to take advantage of combos and counters to be successful in this game. I also had some trouble with the controls. Sometimes Altair doesn't want to go in the direction you want him to. None of these are a deal breaker.

Since I got it used, I can't say a thing about the digital content, as it was not included (well, sometimes the gods of gaming are gentle to you, sometimes you do get some unused DLC on used products...)

In my case, I've got it almost new, the keychain was new, the statue was still wrapped, and the lithographs were beautifully intact, smelling like they just got off the printer!

Here's the review of the contents (as I haven't played the game yet, since I'd rather do it on my PC first to get optimal graphics and a lag-free game)

*Keychain: Even though it's a beautiful thing (very well detailed, with a Rockstar Games emblem on it), I can tell you should be very cautious with it, as it does look like a real bullet and you may get in some trouble (your experience may vary on this one!) If you get in trouble, twist the cap at the end of the ""bullet"" so law enforcement officers will know you're not ""evilly plotting"" (kudos to whoever got this reference!) And yes, you CAN store some stuff on the keychain, I just have no idea on what would fit such small space... maybe these tiny bolts and screws from toys?

*Statue: I don't know if it happens to ALL statues of Max Payne, but mine came with the tip of one of his pistols (the one that looks like he just shoot with) bent down, as if it was melting. It feels rubbery and not entirely plastic, so maybe there's a fix for that, but I didn't bother doing it since I wouldn't risk breaking that part. There's a lot of empty bullet shells on the floor of the statue, and Max was shot in the arm, looks like the creator of this item tried to summarize the game in one art, and he did, because, as you know, Max loves to wield dual handguns and shoot bad guys like he's rambo, only classier and able to slow time.

*Art: The pieces of art from the game are only meaningful for those who played the past games, as they show a syringe (reference to Valkyr?), some painkillers (his best friends during his Payneful journey (see what I did here?)) and other pieces of art shows other things from Max Payne. They are very nice, and very well packed, as they come in a paper envelope (downside: the envelope comes outside the inner box that protects the statue so they can be damaged on transportation, or by those ""spider"" anti-theft things that retailers use (I'd rather see those things behind cages, these spiders can damage the goods...)) and the art pieces are protected by blank sheets of the same paper used to print them in, so every piece of art has a blank sheet in front of it for protection, and this is really nice.",The Payne is back!,1416182400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I expected a corridor shooter with a over the top story but I got much more. The game starts out exactly as you would think, in the middle of action trying to survive and what this game does well is use the situations to slowly teach the player how to play the game. So it starts out as a corridor shooter and slowly expands into more of a sandbox teaching game mechanics as you go. Wolfenstein is full of secrets and gives players plenty of reason to replay levels and the entire game in order to get the full experience. This version of Wolfenstein seems to have been influenced by Dishonored which I liked because I enjoy stealth but guns blazing is always an option for those with a more aggressive play style. There are ways to enhance your play style too by completing objectives to unlock perks. There are also armor and health upgrades that can be found depending on a choice you must make early in the game which splits the game into one of two timelines. Wolfenstein gives the player choices of how to play and where to go to accomplish the missions. I really thought that this would be a nice filler game to keep me busy until Watchdogs released but I'm realizing that this game has a lot to offer and will now be competition for my Watchdogs play time.

Remember playing Ninja Gaiden or Contra or something from the NES back in the day.  The games made you want to break the controller and you usually had to face a boss a few times before you had him mastered enough to squeak by. And sometimes there was this piece you just couldn't pass.  It was frustration, yet rewarding.  You experienced some of the most memorable and epic moments in gaming that way.  This game is like that.

Sure it's not the late 1980s anymore but this new Ninja Gaiden is a worthy installment and does a good job of adapting the classic feeling to the series. It's full of fast paced action, yet you still feel in control.  You could slice by enemies with little effort if you perform well but you can also get careless and die at any moment.  Despite being a game full of fast action, it also has some defense moves, blocking, jumping, and above all rolling that really becomes key to pacing the action in your favor and getting out of harms way. You can upgrade your blade and other weapons you pick up along the way including different kinds of nunchucks.  This never gets tedious it's not like an RPG, it's just a simple 2 or 3 level upgrade that makes your weapon a bit stronger.

Graphics, sound, and all production elements are up to scale with all the other great games.  You get a lot of different levels including army camps, caves, cities, airships most which are actually connected to each other.  Only early in the game when you start in your home town which looks like a basic ancient Japanese town and then board an Airship, will you jump to the level without actually getting there during gameplay or showing a cut scene of how you got there. All in all the graphics and action all flow very smoothly.

The game isn't perfect, some people complain it's too hard, and the camera is a problem.  People said the same thing when the original Devil May Cry came out. And yeah, the camera sometimes puts you in a vulnerable position because you can't see, but I wouldn't even of thought of complaining about that if I hadn't heard other people talking about the camera problems.  I think that's just the genre, you got to deal with it.  It's not a first person shooter.

The only real flaw I can think of is that the main attack button is the same as the button used to interact with the environment to solve light puzzles.  And sometimes during the middle of the action you'll suddenly interact with something, whether it's a downed Ninja that's holding something, a box with arrows or a door.  You'll be in the middle of the intense action and suddenly get near a door without even knowing and you'll be transferred to the other side of the door which is a different section all because the button to interact with doors is the same as the main attack button.  This could have easily of been avoided by the developers.",Best action game since the 2D era,1091491200,,,

As with all earlier Blizzard games, StarCraft is a game of constant action, and it requires even more attention than most other RTS games. The 3 races are evenly balanced and diverse enough to ensure unlimited enjoyment and gameplay, as is Blizzards method for success.

One must keep his eyes on all sectors of the map at all times, lest he allow anything to remain idle, or the let the enemy slip in behind his lines. With such intense action required, this game is easy to learn yet nigh impossible to master.

RF 4 somehow manages to appeal to multiple genres without messing up any one of them. In particular it does a good job of letting the player decide to be more of farmer/socialite or fighter while rewarding those who tackle both. I can't remember much about the plot but I do remember it being interesting--games like these are more about the characters than the plot, so even if you find the plot somewhat elementary you'll likely be satisfied with the charming if not at times two-dimensional characters. RF 4 is all about the power of solidarity/things coming together, so I have to say all the simple aspects of it combine and mesh together to form something far greater, which ties into the theme of the game itself and therefore the overall experience.

5.0,False,"11 25, 2010",A2UO60B9P7MAK3,B002BSA1C6,D. A. Theisen,"The game case makes a bold claim that GT5 is a ""revolution in racing"". Let's not go quite that far. The game does offer oodles of gameplay features and options, and despite some curious features and omissions you'll find in the game's home interface, this is a solid title that can offer nearly infinite replay value with all it brings to the table. Almost all disciplines of racing are covered in some way, giving a good ""something for everyone"" appeal.

A lot has been confused about what GT5 is and isn't. It is what it says it is, ""the real driving simulator"". That is to say you get into real-world cars and drive them in a more sporty atmosphere. Some tracks are perfect recreations, some are fictitious, and some of them impressively created by the game on the fly via a slick course creator. The over 1000 cars range from the family minivan all the way up to Ferraris, LeMans cars, etc. The game does an outstanding job of making even the more mundane cars fun. For example, there's an early event featuring exclusively the Toyota Yaris. Not exactly a sports car, but they are quite nimble and a hoot to flog around.

It is not, however, like a Need For Speed or Burnout game. Driving each track requires some (or a lot of) precision and vehicle control, and this isn't a game where you're meant to just get in a fast car and fly around doing fancy spins and slides. You'll need to pass some license tests and stack up enough money before going in that direction. Thankfully, the difficulty level starts quite low and does offer enough cushioning to a new player.

There are some oddities and things that make the game feel somewhat incomplete. A point of contention is the system of ""premium"" versus ""standard"" cars (split about 200-800), where only those on the Premium list have detailed in-car views and more realistic visual damage. Strangely, the standard cars cannot be visually changed, such as with new wheels or aerodynamic kits. Despite this feeling incomplete and a bit disappointing, the 800 not-as-blessed cars are still drivable in the same enjoyable manner and few players will ever notice the gap.

In fairness, there are some features I am unable to report on-- I have no ability to use its full 3D mode (requiring a 3D HDTV, etc), nor did I have data from Gran Turismo for the PSP to transfer in. I'm also not a big user of online features so I can't report much on the online community features, of which there are tons.

Bottom line? It might seem empty in a few areas of customization and stripped of more gameplay in others, but its still worthy of very high praise on the whole.

Despite coming out earlier than the competing Playstation 3, it has met or exceeded it's competitor in graphics & online gameplay for the majority of games.  Even today it is rare to see a cross-platform title which doesn't play better on the 360.

I own a 360, PS3 and a Wii; and I can honestly say the 360 has gotten the most use (though I still prefer PC).  The main reason for this is most games that come out are cross-platform; and almost all cross-platform games perform better on the 360 (you can see test results at sites such as eurogamer's digital foundry face-off and lensoftruth).  I own the PS3 for PS3 exclusive games, which are great as well but fewer in number.

The Xbox 360 also has Xbox Live which is a great online services for communicating with friends & joining games.

It's one of the best games on the system and you can't go wrong. I do have some pros and cons of this version of the game compared with other versions (other than it's not that innovative). I gave it five stars compared to games in general, but I would give it probably 4 stars compared to other Zelda games.

Pros:
- It brings variety into the gameplay to have the wolf form and be able to ride the horse (and boars). The wolf sense was a great idea as well.
- I liked the new moves that could be learned from the golden wolves. Some of them actually could be a bit challenging on an enemy which hasn't been my experience with past Zelda games.
- Other cool things: different suits, underwater swimming, aiming to shoot, different bombs, lure fishing, talking to animals, twilight

Cons:
- While Midna was useful at some points, I felt like he(/she?) was very overused. Solving little puzzles are one of the signatures of Zelda and I found that Midna often was butting in to tell me something that I either already figured out or before I had time to experiment and figure something out.
- The main adventure was almost too linear. In other Zelda games there were times when I had to say, now what? This meant I had to explore and piece together the clues to figure it out. This game basically just told you where to go. I also thought that the side-quests were in short supply. Sure you had some collecting adventures, but I felt like I was missing that running tally in my head of clues or objects to keep my eye out for. With most Zelda games, I find that if I put it down and don't play it for a few weeks, I would have to start over because I would lose the tally of clues, but I could have come back to this game anytime because there just wasn't much to keep track of.
- While the controls were neat and the gold wolf moves gave variety, I would have liked to actually have to use some of the moves on enemies. I was able to kill almost anything with an L-target and some random combination of swinging and 'A'. I usually killed something before I got a chance to try out the moves.
- Apparently Hyrulians can't walk and talk. Those that you can talk to have nothing useful to say with only a few exceptions. I was excited to see how crowded the city was, only to realize that it didn't actually have much in it.","Fantastic game, best points and worst points",1195603200,2,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

The players are more realistic in their actions, including when injured they don't just lie there flopping around. When a team gets a penalty called on it, there's different referees for each game and sometimes the head coach will yell at the ref for the call.
Each team also has more offensive and defensive plays to call, which is another improvement over last season. A play like the hail mary, which every team uses, is also now easier to find because EA has given that play it's own formation, so all you have to do is find the Hail Mary formation and call the play, no more getting a delay of game penalty trying to find the play.
The SI covers are an outstanding addition to the game too, they just make it more fun to see if you're on the cover after each week. You can also keep up with who's leading the Heisman race after every week now as well, not just after week 8 like in the 2003 game.
I haven't gotten to the end of the season in my dynasty yet, but the recruiting is supposed to be better in this game as well, including being able to try to talk any players who are thinking of leaving your program early into staying! What an addition!
The only drawback is I've read comments from the excellent EA sports development team from this game that the NCAA talked them out of including tearing down the goalposts after an upset victory.

QUICK REVIEW:

I rate BATTLEFIELD: BAD COMPANY, 5 out of 5 stars! - I am a huge fan of first person shooters, but this game tops them all. BAD COMPANY is my favorite FPS for a number of reasons...

1) It is modern! There are way too many WW2 games out there and I appreciate the newer guns and technology (hell yes to the air-strike)! The only other modern game for the PS3 that I really enjoyed and that could keep my attention was CoD Modern Warfare.

2) The campaign was well put together. Even though the story line is kind of cheesy, it was a lot of fun and kept me coming back for more. I have actually played it all the way through a few times on all the difficulty settings (mainly to get the trophies) and have enjoyed each time. It takes between 8 and 12 hours to beat the campaign, depending on the difficultly.

3) The graphics and audio are great!

4) The online multiplayer is amazing!! I have been playing this game for well over a year and play online at least once a week. The scoring system is great, the engine is great, everything about the online play is an A+ in my book! A few of my friends have even bought PS3's exclusively for this game.

5.0,False,"11 29, 2016",A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B01DJPA9YE,Arch Stanton,"Anyone who's been paying attention to Square Enix for the last decade or so should come to any new Final Fantasy game with a mixture of trepidation and excitement. Final Fantasy used to be the best JRPG series out there, but after IX or X the series went downhill rapidly with a series of disappointing games that pleased no one. Particularly XIII with its endless corridor, vapid characters, and needlessly convoluted and overexposited plot. And I gotta say, the early glimpses did not bode well. The demo Episode Duscae was decidedly mixed, with some nice visuals but mediocre combat and character fluff. Then came Kingsglaive, which they've thrown in here, that seemed to make every mistake XIII did (needlessly complicated, prioritizing expensive visuals over clarity, dull or whiny characters with nothing in between, etc.) with the added sin of being visually uninteresting and modern. Which means that a lot of people are relying on this game to restore the series to its roots and bring back the fun, adventure, and sense of exploration that used to define the series. No pressure, right?

Obviously no game could live up to those lofty expectations, but XV is still a great game, and even a great Final Fantasy game. And a lot of that is because it doesn't play it safe and dish out a generic Final Fantasy designed to hit all the old nostalgia buttons and nothing else. It takes risks, some of them quite radical and unexpected. The chief of these is the open world. Making the game a sandbox was an obvious way to reassure after XIII's endless corridor, yet it also risked turning the game into just another Fallout clone with Anime characters. But it really works. A large part of it is that the game's built not around a quest so much as a road trip with a gang of friends. Naturally there's some rush off and save the world stuff that you need to do, but the real pleasure here comes from the little things. The discussion over meals, the comfortable banter, the endless photographing... It's like going on holiday with that cool gang you always envied in high school but never quite got in with.

The three basic strengths of this game are the gameplay, the characters, and the visuals. Gameplay is first rate and offers something new to the whack and slash genre of fighting games. Noctis can summon weapons at will and teleport himself into attacks or out of combat. He has four different weapon types to choose from at the touch of a button and different weapons work better on different enemies. It's both an awesome visual and highly functional system. It's been vastly improved from the Duscae demo they released a year back. Weapons and magic are fully customizable and easily used in combat, although being realtime does limit some of the spells. Your teammates are not directly controllable, but you do need to monitor and coordinate them. They also help you out. Even though you've lost complete control it does feel like a group battle rather than just one player vs. the world.

This game is all about character, to put it mildly. If they didn't work nothing else would. Fortunately, the characters are a lot of fun and have amazing Latin names. Noctis Lucis Caelum (Literally: Heaven of the Nightlight) is the prince of Lucis and your typical moody teenage Anime protagonist. That said, he's never so moody it's annoying and he has good reason to be morose given that his kingdom was just taken over by the badguys and his father killed leaving him to reclaim his throne and save the world. The other characters are a part of his retinue. Gladiolus (lit: Dagger) is his big brother type bodyguard, Ignis (lit: Fire) is his calculating tactician/butler, and Prompto (lit: with eagerness) is a schoolfriend/comic relief. And contrary to expectations the comic relief never becomes too much of a whiny git to entertain.

Each of them fits a fairly clear archetype, and on their own they're not very memorable, but when together (and they always are) they form an awesome band of bros out having themselves a fantastic road trip. Oh, and saving the world on the side. Every effort is made to keep their character interactions real and fresh. They even give the characters a personal life outside of you, such as Prompto's interest in photography (which works well with the PS4's sharing system) and Ignis' fondness for cooking. You really feel like part of the band. The best thing I can say about these guys is that when you're separated from them at various points it hurts. You feel isolated and alone. I even found myself worrying about the fates of the other guys. And the reunions left me genuinely moved. That's a well done game.

The visuals are one of the game's other high points, and a major difference from earlier games in the series. They worried us all by their obsession with realistically recreating parts of Tokyo for the capital city of Insomnia and giving our leads mundanely realistic costumes of black leather, but Insomnia barely features at all and the matching costumes make the quartet look like part of the same boy band. You do get modern gas stations, but they're right alongside chocobo farms and giant stone arches that make no sense. The monsters are inventive too, with my favorite being the lake monsters that look like hairy brachiosaurs. All of it is rendered in stunningly lifelike graphics that almost make you believe this is a real place. Real and magical sit side by side unnoticeably. It's perfect.

If this game has a fault it's that the main plot isn't very well established. It feels a lot like XIII in that way. It's never clearly laid out why you're doing what you're doing (and the parts that are explained certainly aren't emphasized nearly enough) and too much of the lifting is left to the lore. Unlike XIII though, the plot is basic enough that it's not a problem. You know early on what the end goal is and if some of the stops along the way don't particularly make sense you never feel completely lost. A lot of people will probably comment negatively on the second part of the game. There reaches a point where the open world dries up and the game adopts a more linear approach. It's necessary, although I'll concede that it could probably have flowed more naturally. I didn't find this part fun, not because it was badly done but because it was painful. Things go wrong and the game starts to feel pretty harsh. It's a measure of the feeling you have for these characters that you're unhappy when they are. I didn't realize how much I cared about these guys until they started suffering. The ending is satisfying if bittersweet, and the character moments at this stage feel truly earned.

There are a lot of other things I loved about the game, including the music, dungeon design, and various technical features. But it would take all day to describe them. It's a great game, far better than I feared it would be and up there with the core of brilliant Final Fantasies (basically, VI-X), even while being nothing like them.

I have to say I was disappointed in the previous games like Blue Dragon and Eternal Sonata.  I was even hesitant about getting this game because I didn't care much about Tales of Symphonia.  However, I decided to take the chance, and was well rewarded.

The one thing I have always considered a good RPG to have is storyline.  I believe Namco fulfilled this.  The story is engrosing from beginning to end.  I really wanted to turn to the next page of the story and learn all the secrets.  There were even a few good twists that helped strengthen it.

However, the best part of the game is the characterization involved.  What I especially liked was that everyone was ""human"".  Even Yuri who is the main character is no knight in shining armor who obeys the rules (he's just your average guy throughout the story).  I also enjoyed the small skits throughout the game.  Though only talking portraits, they were fun to watch and you really got a sense of the bond everyone shared.

The animation is not the best X-box 360 can do, but for the purposes of telling this tale, Namco did well.  The animation shown as a type of anime style.  Though it doesn't push the bounds, the detail involved is still good, and you can clearly see the expressions on the characters clearly.

In terms of gameplay, the game is great.  I never got tired of the battle sequences.  You can use anywhere between 1 to 8 special moves that can easily be executed by pushing a arrow key and the special attack button.  To further describe the combat sequences, it is similar to Star Ocean 3 or Star Ocean 2, only more flexible and easier to use.  You also have the ability to change weapons or special moves during battle.  This is especially helpful against the various monsters.  Not all weapons can damage certain enemies.

Overall, this game really set the bar high for future RPGs.  Good story, excellent characterization, and flexible gameplay you can taylor.  This game is worth it.",A title that is worth it!,1244764800,3,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

I played this on the PS3 first, the controls weren't as responsive as the first two so I gave it up quick. Then I decided to give the PC version a go after purchasing a gaming computer. And needless to say I was surprised at how much better this is for the PC, control wise. The graphics are about the same for me since my gaming rig isn't the best (but pretty darn good!) but graphics aren't everything and aren't what makes this game good. Rather the story, and better voice acting. I understand a lot of people love the previous voice actors (I liked them too) but the new guys and gals weren't to bad, in fact I think they are better a fit for video games. While the previous voice actors are best for animated movies/tv shows, imo.

Overall the controls are about the same, but you get a few new gadgets. And while the gameplay is almost identical there is still something fresh about the story that makes the game worth playing. I recommend starting this game on Easy and working your way up just for replay value, and to unlock stuff. This one will be played, a lot by the time I am done with it!

If  you haven't played an Etrian Odyssey game yet, it is a fun RPG that has you take 5 characters out and about fighting monsters, mapping a multi-level labrinth, finding treasures, and fulfilling missions and quests. You don't need to play the first one to enjoy this game, in fact this game gives you more of a tutorial as you go through for new people.

I really like the mapping feature, at first I thought it was dumb but then I found it really keeps me going, I want to keep seeing how the map will turn out on each floor. And the mapping tools are improved on this version, there are now more icons to use, including three different colors of item points (you can chop, mine or take in this game to collect things to sell or use) and there is now a open door and locked door icons, for those special doors that need a key.

Other new features I like - if you forget what you need to do for a quest, you can find out in your quest menu exactly what it is. Also in the store, you can look at your characters as you look at the weapons for sale and see how they would improve with a new weapon without having to go to ""eqiup"". Probably my favorite new feature is when you go to the custom list - this is how you upgrade your characters whenever you get a new skill point for them - the skills that are not available now show a prerequisite feature on the side, telling you which skills you need to add before you can aquire the skill. In the first game, some of the skills I wanted I could never figure out how to get to them.

There are extra types of players available now, War Magus and Beast, and Ronin and Hexer are available immediatly. Watch out though cause some of the characters that had certain skills do not have them and other characters do. Such as the Protector used to have Stalker, now the Survivalist has it.

The Geomagnetic fields are different now, at first I was thinking they were less convienient but then I discovered they are more helpful. There are poles every few floors now and you can warp to them from town, to the latest one anyway, but not from them to town. Always have a Warp Wire with you! Then there are the fields - you can use them both to the statum and to town, and you access these on the first option at the forest - the labrinth option. These go to the beginning of each stratum. By the way the second Statum is really pretty! I enjoy in this game and the last one seeing what the new stratums will be. Each one has about 5 floors on it, and has a different theme, so the forest looks that way for the 5 floors.

Some things I don't like about the new game - there is no Amrita right away! I found out on a website that you have to wait till floor 15 for it to show up at the store! In the first game it is there right away, and is an essential item as it allows you to replenish your TP, which is magic points that you use to use specialized skills. Also, there is only one file for saving on the game, bummer (was the same for the first game too).

Also, you do not get experience points for fighting FOES! This really bugs me. And they are really hard to fight. There are even some that don't show up on the map.
If you haven't played Etrian Odyssey yet, these are extra bad monsters that stalk a certain area until you kill them, and sometimes they even come back later. They show up on the map as purple arrows.
(Ordinary monsters just randomly show up every so often, and you can use Stalker to help lower the encounter rate.)

This game is more challenging than the first one. I am doing a lot more running around building up my characters than even in Etrian Odyssey. I have some advice. Make sure you have a gunner in your group. He/She can get the skill Haltshot right away if you give it to him/her. Then use it to freeze FOES for a few turns. You will need this on the 2nd and 3rd floor to even get past them in the beginning so you don't get bored on the first floor after you've mapped it.

Also, you can now register up to 30 characters. I registered my main 5 people, then one of each kind at at least (you may need other characters later for certain gameplay and quests) and then I am making additional Survivalists cause they can have all three of the collectings skills, Mine, Chop and Take. Then I take 4 of my main ones and one of the newer ones out to the 4-5 floors to collect stuff, when you take a weaker character out with stronger ones they upgrade in a hurry! So they can do a lot of collecting pretty quick. There is a limit each day so I try to take as many characters out as I can before I sleep. Remember to take strong characters with the weak one or you will die fast. This helps me gain money and also helps upgrade my main characters, and at the Take item points I can collect Sour Fruit or Mugwort, which gives you a little bit of TP. Since there is no Armirita right away, this is important. Also have some of your main party have Take as well so you can collect what you need when out and about doing new mapping.",Glad they made another!,1216425600,26,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

You can unlock 5 times the amount of characters including Ganondorf, Mewtwo, Dr. Mario, Young Link, Prince Marth, Roy, Mr. Game and Watch, and ALOT MORE! Theres bonus levels called ""Adventure"" on which the levels are side scrollers and throughout the levels you go into smash bros. battle. There are several ways to unlock different characters. You even have Princess Peach, and Zelda. And Zelda can turn into Sheik!
The new levels are infinity awesome. Some of them are even challenging. I forgot the names of them but you'll like be on a moving platform and if you jump off you die and sometimes the platform will land for like 10 seconds and during those 10 seconds, space ships or whatever those are on F-Zero GX come flying for half the time and you have to get on another platform. There is also another zelda level, more mario ones, another samus one, a ness one, and some others!
If I haven't mentioned graphics yet, the graphics to this from the original were totally upgraded! Theres new moves and everything for the characters too!
Outstanding gameplay. Multiplayer Action. Singleplayer Action. Tons more characters. Tons more levels. Much better graphics. New Adventure levels. New moves. Theres nothing you don't want in this game. Its the best game ever. Get it. Don't rent it, don't try it out, get it and keep it!

5.0,True,"12 2, 2011",A2JS52P35VIJND,B005JQ05RS,Tacos and Pizza,"Since I have played these games numerous times on multiple operating systems (XP/ XPx64, Vista and 7)(bought each individually) I found it might be helpful to know certain things ahead of time prior to purchase:

1. In order to to play the original Neverwinter Nights Campaigns on the later versions of windows you need to insure that you have the latest ""critical rebuild"" patch available from bioware (a few hundred MBs)and you should run the game in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP2, more than likely in game cut screens will not work. If you do not have game version 1.69 or later versions of Windows will block the program due to ""known compatibilty issues"", You may also need to download older versions of the .NET Framework and ""override"" them if windows asks you about software compatibility.

2. Make sure to install all expansion packs for NWN2 prior to playing and you must run the update patch prior to installing mysteries of westgate. The reason for this is that when installing Mask of the Betrayer it creates a glitch in the original campaign that will stop game play early on. It will also provide more classes to choose from for those who are playing for the first time.

3. Intel Graphics adapters are not supported. Ensure you have an ATI (AMD) Radeon or NVIDIA Graphics card with pixel shader 2.0 or later with 3.0 or later recommended. I also recommend making sure that you have dedicated graphics. You will need to install Direct X 9 even if you have 10 (Windows Vista) or 11 (Windows 7) so choose to allow the game to install it for you or download the redistributal package from Microsoft's website.

4. For Better audio support use a 3rd party Sound card as opposed to your standard on board graphics (for more of a ""3-D Sound"" feel). I use Sound Blaster X-FI. 5. As reference here is what I used (system wise) to play the game on ""ultra-high"" settings with no issues:

AMD Phenom II X6 1100T Black Edition Thuban 3.3GHz, 3.7GHz Turbo Socket AM3 125W Six-Core Desktop Processor

Sapphire AMD Radeon HD 6850 PCIe 2.1 x 16 1GB DDR5 256 bit graphics card (Shader Model 5.0)
Sound Blaster X-FI Titanium
MSI 890GXM-G65 Motherboard
OCZ Vertex 2 SSD Sata II in Raid 0 (only mention becuase it helps to greatly eliminate load times between areas).

This is just a reference to guess how your computer might perform, this game does occasionally ""run away"" and start eating up system resources very intensively.",Additional things that may help after purchase for better enjoyment.,1322784000,68,,

However, looking at it right now, it doesn't seem they are going to bring the PS3 version to the states. If you are an RPG fan, especially a Tales fan, with a 360, you probably already own this game.

It's one of the best games for the PlayStation 2, if not the best. The reason I love and hate it are the difficulty shifts: one mission will be dead easy while the next is like pulling teeth.....through your [rear end] wrapped up in barb wire and steel wool dragged behind a truck on a road of glass shards and salt while naked.

My PlayStation 2 is lucky to have survived  one particular mission. One particular mission featuring the most annoying character of all of media....AND THAT'S INCLUDING JAR JAR BINKS!!!  And that mission is known as OG Loc.  My utter hatred of Loc cannot be described here lest I'm forbidden to write another review on this site.  You thought I was harsh on the flying missions in my GTA V review....well that's nothing compared to my hatred of this walking abortion.  I would be put on a list if I describe how much I hate Loc and what would I do to his voice actor.....I'd make Charlie Manson look like Mickey Mouse. Sorry for harping on this character but you don't realize my pain.  I wasn't lying when I said that my PlayStation 2 was lucky enough to survive to see more missions from this awesome game.  Yes I know it's a relatively early mission but I must've repeated that mission at least ten times.....and listening to that voice over and over and over and over and over and over again can make one murderous.

You play as CJ who is returning for his mother's funeral.  As with most GTA games you get involved with crooked cops one of which is voiced by the ever awesome Samuel L Jackson.  The map is absolutely huge but you're confined to a small area until you reach a certain point and unlock the rest of the map.

I never beat this game due to the high difficulty of the last portion of the game. Short of using cheat codes I can't see how anyone can beat this game....that's how hard it is.

The highlight of the game is a casino break-in ala Ocean's Eleven.  And that mission was fun.....despite the flying.  The prep work for it reminds me of the heists in GTA V.

I have a love/hate relationship with this game but that fact doesn't mean I won't give it five stars because it absolutely deserves five stars. The game is a near masterpiece.  The voice acting is top notch.",Gang wars in Los Santos,1471046400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I suppose it all goes with the ""entitled"" generation, but I personally found lots to enjoy about this game.

First off, something that I'm sure has already been well documented, these graphics will really blow your mind. I have been gaming since the SNES days and this game has the best graphics I have ever seen on a console by far.

The aesthetics are all on point and I particularly love the whole Victorian era/Tesla-punk style that incorporated werewolves and vampires as well as other gothic lore such as the Order itself.

Now on to the criticisms. The first issue I had is a relatively small one and frankly just means that I liked the game so much I wanted more of it! People that complain about spending ""X"" amount of dollars on a video game to only get ""X"" amount of hours of gameplay are impatient and clueless. It's not about the amount of time you can play the game, it's about the quality of the experience. If someone gave you the game for free does your opinion change?

I didn't have a problem with the story but in a hopeful sequel I would like to delve more into the world and factions of The Order. I also think there needs to be more RPG elements to the game, most games these days either include RPG elements, open world elements or both, so to play a game without either seems a bit limited.

Finally the weapons. While the weapons were pretty sweet (especially the Tesla ones), there wasn't enough specialty weapons or items. Not being able to carry more than 1 rifle and 1 sidearm, while it seems realistic, did get frustrating at times.

I liked this game a lot and I know Ready At Dawn, who is still a young studio, will take fans opinions into consideration if and when they decide to go for a sequel.",Ready At Dawn Shows Extreme Promise 4.5*,1427673600,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",
5.0,False,"06 9, 2009",A3ALLLC2FXZ134,B001TOMQZI,Halicon5,"Sorry for the bad pun in the title, but the first words out of my mouth when booting this game up were, ""Oh wow!  Tiger got ugly!""  Thankfully, first impressions don't matter for much with this game.  Mostly, I purchased this game to get a crack at the new Wii Motion Plus controller accessory, so this review is as much a review of the game as the hardware.  If you buy the version with the wii motion plus pack-in, you also get a new silicone sheath for the wii remote, which is a nice touch.

GAMEPLAY: So basically, the game is golf, something that I do quite poorly at in real life.  Golf games and I do about as poorly.  Every few years I go out and buy a golf game, and I basically pay attention to fun and accessibility.  On both counts, the game is very, very good.

CONTROL: With the Wii Motion Plus, this game plays better than any other golf game that I've ever played.  Give yourself thirty minutes with the new motion controls and you may never be able to go back to Wii Sports Golf.  The controls feel realistic and responsive, but kind enough to make the game accessible to a golf neophyte.  Without the Wii motion plus, all I could think of doing was putting the motion plus accessory back on as quickly as possible.

GRAPHICS: Serviceable.  I've seen a lot better looking games on the Wii.  Water is barely animated and looks pretty pixelated, trees are low res, and character models are only a bit better looking.  Character animation is very smooth though and the game seems to match your motions in real life fairly nicely.  Oh, but not the crowd... they look really really bad and are animated extremely poorly.

AUDIO: It's golf with announcers.  Sometimes the announcers say some pretty funny stuff, but mostly it's what you would expect from any golf event, either in a game or in real life.

FEATURES: Absolutely stuffed.
- This game has lots of game modes, one of them being disc golf.  I can already tell that disc golf is going to be one of my favorite party games.  Disc golf does away with the announcers and replaces them with some tacky elevator music, but party games usually end up with the stereo blasting mixes from someone's iPod or Zune at unhealthy levels, right?

- Character Customization: Deep and highly customizable.  Want to make an aging, pot-bellied, Asian, redneck, punk-rocker with missing teeth, a mohawk, cowboy boots, fu-manchu, mutton chops, and a kilt?  You can do it.  My friend and I spent at least 45 minutes tricking out our characters trying to make the most outlandish combinations we could think of and we had fun doing it.  You can go into the shop and buy additional stuff with your winnings to get even more cool items to trick your character out with.

- As you play, your character gains experience in different abilities and areas.  You can spend this experience to boost your stats.  This definitely increases the replay value for completionists.

- Online play that doesn't require friend codes!

- Dynamic weather that integrates with the Wii Weather channel.  Seems kind of cool.  The feature definitely isn't based off of your local weather and seems to be based off the weather at that particular golf course in real life.  I'm pretty sure of this because it was raining heavily all evening in my town and none of my games had any rain.

VALUE: With over 20 courses, disc golf, and a decently deep experience system will keep dedicated players playing for a very long time.  Multi-player gameplay is a blast and great for groups of friends.

Overall, I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys golf games and also to gamers that only casually enjoy golf games.  I'm not exaggerating when I say this is the best golf game that I've ever played to date.  This game has features that I'll probably never ever see or even touch, but other people may love them.  The nearly instantaneous ability to pick up and play the game is very nice, but there are enough nuances to the game that hardcore players will definitely have a game to hone their skills on.  This is probably one of the only sports games I will ever review as a ""must have"" title for anyone who enjoys the genre.","Great golf game, but the graphics didn't quite make par.",1244505600,61,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The whole process took about ten or fifteen minutes, but the ""ease"" of doing so far outweighed the actual download time (I will gladly sacrifice fifteen minutes if it means that I don't have to fill out a form, or answer questionaires, etc).

UNITY OF COMMAND is yet another ""Russian Front"" wargame, but even if that isn't your particular area of interest, I'd recommend ordering the game merely as a very good example of game design (even if you never end up playing it, it's worth having around just to look at).  I'm 50, and I've been playing wargames since I was ten (I was one of the first people to start playing AXIS&ALLIES, and one of the first to see the potential in the two player version of that game).  I've played MAGIC:THE GATHERING and EMPIRE BUILDER, and now, in middle age, I really need something in the form of a semi-casual computer game, with a good artificial intelligence.

After sampling many game reviews on Youtube, I say that this game walks that fine edge between ease-of-play and interesting-to-play (ie, it is not so easy that it ends up being dopey or foolish).

The tutorial is a little hard to find (at first), but it is there (after you click on ""scenarios"").  And the rulebook is very user-friendly.  The game has my highest recommendation.",Well worth the price,1365379200,23,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC Download'}",

This means that I've had a lot of experience with the agony of defeat, and a recent thrill of victory. The Madden NFL 2002 lets me relive all of that with amazing graphics and superb gameplay.
The XBox version of Madden 2002 is similar to the PS2 version, but they've kicked it up a notch. The graphics are even more stellar - now you get scratched helmets and dirty uniforms. The players are still as sharp on their feet, and the movements of your crew is super smooth. I've had people walk in the room and think a real game was on before they realized it was us playing.
Sure, you can complain about the inane chatter of Pat and John. Do you really listen to what they're saying? That's all background noise, like the cheers of the fan and the meaningless ""I talked to the coach"" reporting that starts each game. It adds to the feeling of the game, but it isn't the game's core.
It's funny to see other reviews, because some people say the passing is super easy and the running is hard, while others say that the running game is easy and the passing game is hard. It all comes down to your own particular game style, the teams you choose and how you tend to use the players. Again, that's where the game shines. You can super-customize it to be challenging for you, no matter how you like to play. You really do get drawn into it, feeling like you are out there on the field.
The true test is when you watch a real football game after playing this for weeks, and you start to think of the real game as a video game :) When you reach that level, you know you're hooked!","Is it live, or is it a computer game?",1013817600,2,,

I am amazed at the length of  battery life the controller has.  If it does get low on battery life, it has a long USB cord that came with it, so it can be used while charging.  At our house the rule is, when done playing plug it in to charge just like they have to put the Wii U Game Pad back on the charge stand when not using it.

I only bought one to see how we liked it and I plan on buying another one.  Everyone seems to grab that one for any games it is compatible with.",Wii U Pro Controller,1376524800,,,

I have finished the game (it took about 80 hours) so here is the final review. I have also added combat tips to the end.

First of all, I love the game. The combat is awesome if you like strategy games. The game has more in common with strategy/rpgs rather than traditional JRPGs. As in any rgp you can roam inside the cities, get side quests, and explore the world map. However, the combat and the missions are very much like that of turn based strategy games. In fact, ROF is more like a strategy game under a JRPG disguise.

Although the combat looks flashy and cool, as I saidbefore, RoF is not an action oriented game. The combat is very deep and strategic. Also learning curve is steep, it takes several hours to learn all the intricacies of the combat, and I will not attempt to explain it here. (I have added some tips and tricks at the end). However, the turn system is very similar to Valkyria Chronicles, it is a mixture of turn based and real-time (while you are moving the enemy also moves and can attack you). Flanking, timing, the type of attack etc. all plays a key role in combat and makes it very satisfying. They are nice to watch too, although your eyes would be on the action gauges most of the time.

There is a tutorial that introduces every battle action but it does not tell you about the tactics. (Think of chess, you can learn the rules in half an hour but you'll have absolutely no idea about the tactics). So the game got better as I played because I began to discover some of the mechanics and the tactics not described in the tutorial. It also has some real-time elements that require timing, which keeps things interesting and gives you some more tricks to help you. (For example, you can manually evade physical attacks if you time your movement right). It takes a long time to master every trick of the combat, but it is very satisfying when you discover something new.

Leveling and customization is all about the guns not the characters. There are 3 types of weapons (handguns, machine guns, and grenades). As the characters use a weapon they get more proficient with that weapon and level up. A character's level is the sum of all 3 weapon levels. For example, a level 20 character can be level 15 handgun, level 4 machine gun, level 1 grenade. As they level up their hit points and respective gun weight limit improve. Also they gain some additional effects (5% stun chance for instance).

You can only customize your weapons. Guns have 5-6 attachment slots (magazine, grip, sights etc.) that you can upgrade with the parts you found. Also you can add extensions to all slots(e.g. adding another barrel to the barrel). However you have space and weight limits that you need to consider. Finally, you can also craft special parts from the basic materials you get from monsters. There is no other customization. There is no armor either, however characters can equip two rings some of which are protective. You can buy a lot of different dresses but they have no effect other than changing the looks of your character (this also affects cutscenes as they are done with the in-game engine).

The story is slow to start. It starts to pick up after Chapter 5 (which would be 10-20 hours into the game depending on the number of sidequests you do), but it is one of the weak points of the game. It does get interesting, but a lot of things are left unexplained even after the game is finished. Simply put, this is not a story-driven game. There are a lot of fetch quests at the beginning but at least the NPCs are quirky, and the interaction between the characters can be funny sometimes. Later on, I got more interested in the story but game only hints at what's going on and never fully explains the background or the motives of the characters.

In sum, this is not a traditional JRPG like Final Fantasy or Lost Odyssey, it is more similar to strategy games like Valkyria Chronicles. Also if you want fast paced, action oriented, quick resolution combats (e.g. Tales of Vesperia) then this is probably not the game for you. If you like turn based strategy/rpg games (Jagged Alliance, Front Mission, Valkyria Chronicles, etc) with a lot of depth then I believe you will like this game.

*** Some Combat Tips and Tricks ***

In ROF, you have access to the full combat from the beginning (opposite of Final Fantasy XIII from what I hear). However, as you play you get a better understanding of the mechanics and the tactics. In other words, the combat opens up naturally and always stays fresh. Below are some tips but I believe half of the fun is discovering them. If you feel confused, then these might help. Also the guy next to the billboard in the guild gives one new tip each chapter. Always talk to him.

-The letter next to the enemy bar indicates which one of your characters the enemy is aiming.
-The enemy won't shoot until the end of the turn (even if their aiming bar is full) unless they are aiming at the character you are moving.  If they are aiming at the character you are moving, they'll shoot in real time when their aim gets full.
-During hero runs you are invincible and also you can regenerate more because the turn lasts longer (depending on the distance). However, that also means enemies will have longer time to aim at characters.
-The circular green bar around the enemy is their equipment health (weapon, armor, shield etc). You will not be able to damage their body until you create/find an opening.  The green bar is not always a full circle and if that's the case, you can make a hero run (or walk around while they are aiming at somebody else) and shoot when you have the right angle to hit the body. Or if you jump during hero run you randomly hit all body parts, you might get some hits to the body even if they are shielded.
-Getting rid of the enemy parts (equipment) will give you materials for upgrades.
-Try to set up the tri-attacks in a long range. The longer the running distance, the more time to shoot (and regenerate).
-You can make a tri-attack even with 1 resonance point. This can be helpful if the distance between the characters is long. You can also use it to move one of your characters to safety if he is going to be shot as soon as you end the turn of the current character.
-Charge acceleration is very important. Try to add barrels as much as you can. Also try to shoot at the highest possible charge to activate the skills.
-Dual wielding helps a lot in the later game(after chapter 10-11). It doubles your damage and chances of activating skills even if the second weapon may reduce some of your stats.
-During a tri-attack, the enemies inside the triangle won't move, the ones on the outside will.
-If you are outnumbered stun and electro grenades can give you valuable time.",Great game if you like strategy,1268956800,177,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

1 - I AM OUTSIDE!!! Thank the gods of gaming! I am so sick of playing in dungeons, burned out space stations. Also if I have to kill one more Nazi or alien in a game, I am going to go kill some programmers myself! The outside world of FARCRY is awesome.

2 - The AI is awesome. The AI is also very stupid at times. Not a good as UT 2004...not even close but atleast realistic. Some humans would be busy looking in other directions, talking, fixing things. This makes it very realistic. Stir them up and they will swarm you like yellow jackets would! Woo Hoo!!!!
3 - Finally, I was glad to see a good first shooter with a fun and somewhat creative selection of weapons. Silenced guns, grenade launchers, rifles...the whole enchilada! I was disappointed that the tear gas grenades basically did nothing to stop the enemies though. Oh well.

Since then, the game has been really polished and surprisingly lag free.  The maps are massive, and you really get a sense that you are a part of something bigger than most online FPS.

Every time you play it's a different story since you are most likely in a different area of the map, and must rely on a different set of squad mates to accomplish tasks.  It really sets up for epic battles in which the tables can turn ever so quickly!  Communication is a must, so I would highly recommend getting a mic.

The only downside to this game is that the sabotage maps can get repetitive.  Hopefully they will introduce one more for each faction.  I've had my share of bad battles in which your thrown in with a group of players that don't understand the value of teamwork, but I'd say I've encountered that in less than 10% of the games I played.  As people get used to this game, I'm sure things will change (and I've noticed a difference in the last week).  There are tons of clans/groups out there.  Play with people who are team oriented and it really adds so much to the game.

It truly is an an awesome experience, and I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is interested in a team-based FPS.  It really comes down you unifying to defeat the enemy.  ENJOY!",Fresh Massive Multiplayer Online FPS!!,1265068800,2,,

There are 0 bugs that i've found, the only thing i've found to be somewhat annoying, is that the online ranking are all messed up because of people who cheated using gameshark. the single player game is so addictive that i found myself playing into the morning, and then feeling bad when i put the controller down to goto sleep. I have yet to unlock everything but it is only a matter of time, its so fun unlocking things, there are so many things to unlock you basically get an award for everything you win.

the online mode is fantastic, i find myself LOL-ing everytime i play a race, road rage is the funnest, although i don't see many games for it. I remember the night after i got the game, i had a crash server set up that i would change the crash location every game of 3 crashes, my server was so popular i didn't turn it off until it was empty. I even had regulars. The next night i set up a road rage, and got pretty angry, i mean this one guy kept using the same car, every race, and got his team to win everytime. I helped make my team win by taking him out after i was already eliminated. fun stuff.

the 2 player split screen multiplayer is great, there are so many tracks, so much to do, its insane. I haven't had so much fun with my sister/friends since burnout 2 came out.

out of everything in this game the only complaint i have about it is the lack of the ability to see the race replays, i liked this in burnout 2, but it being missing, makes me miss out on cool things the other players did, although there are no race replays, the game is still jam-packed with replayability, this game will last long in my collection.",first perfect game of this year,1096329600,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Few have been able to and there have been some horrible examples in the past. Batman Arkham Asylum breaks this mold like a sledge hammer going through a piece of dry wall. In this game you feel like Batman, from the detective skills to the combat you feel immersed in the game. The story is great and the game play fits the story and style perfectly. I think it important to mention the design of the game because it captures Arkham with amazing detail. You feel like you are making your way into the heart of darkness, the design, the Gothic architecture, all blend to make a truly immersive game that somehow avoid feeling repetitive. Even when fighting multiple armed foes you feel like the bad ass you are as Batman. The boss battles are great and well laid out. The only disappointment is the ended, I won't ruin it but I think it could have ended much better.

It would be better if the choices made in the game effected the locations available to you or the outcome more.

The multiplayer is fun.  Like all multiplayer games, the server lag and matchmaking can be questionable during high volume play times, but that always resolves itself fairly quickly.

This device is, if anything, easier to use.  It comes with 2 boxes -- one plugs into your XBox ethernet port, the other plugs into your router.  There is no setup.  There is nothing to configure on the XBox.  As far as the XBox is concerned, this is a regular ethernet linkup and it just starts working.

I hooked it up, did some rounds of COD4 and downloaded a movie and I noticed no difference versus when I had the XBox plugged directly in to my router (but I didn't want my router in my living room, which is why I got this).

You should also be able to use these for any no-setup wireless connection you want.  It's the ""Xbox Play Link"" but there's really nothing about it that makes it specific to the XBox.  It will work for anything.  (The boxes themselves do not say ""Xbox"" anywhere on them.)

Word of caution, though:
Check the prices.

As of the time of this writing, Amazon is not stocking the device and you can only buy it through 3rd parties.  I was lucky and got it through a 3rd party here for a good price, but now I see only one place selling it, and they've marked it up considerably.  Shop around before you buy.

So... the unfair comparison is this:  I'm jumping into GTA5 after playing the abysmal Mass Effect Andromeda.  I mean, if you eat a slice of NY cheesecake after downing a pack of Twinkies, of course the cheesecake will seem like heaven.
I bought Mass Effect Andromeda back in Oct or November and played that game for about 4 months (I only get little chunks of time during a week, and I'm the type to explore every corner and play every side mission).  However, ME4 is such a tedious mess of game, that I quickly started hating it about a third of the way through.  But no matter, I started it, I'm going to finish it.

Once done, my next game was GTA5.  Now I'm facepalming at myself in the mirror because THIS is the game I should have been playing for the last 4 or 5 months, not that awful dirt stain-under-the-shadow-of-its-former-self-of-a-game Mass Effect 4.  While ME4 is inferior to its previous games and in of itself, becomes increasingly worse the more you play, GTA5 is the exact opposite:  Perfectly inline with its predecessors and becomes increasingly more fun the farther you get into the story.  I'd also have to say the missions and side-missions in GTA5 are some of the most perfectly balanced ever in any game.  Even in older GTA games, some tasks or jobs become a bit tedious and repetitive, but not in GTA5.  There are some side-story missions that are so fun, you wish there were more!  Even BETTER than GTA4, your entire map is practically unlocked from the get go as well.

And all this I'm typing about? Is just the single-player mode! I've yet to even take a crack at GTA online or try Director mode yet.  I feel like this will be the only game I play until Red Dead 3 releases.

The GTA series is the king of open world sandbox games.  Its closest rival, which I also love but is more the b-movie version, is Saints Row.  Sleeping Dogs was a worthy attempt, something about Crackdown doesn't quite cut it either, and [the first] Watchdogs is absolute garbage compared to GTA.","Review THE PRODUCT, not the seller, you not-knowing-how-to-use-Amazon customers!",1523318400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

my 4 year old 1st version psp was getting lots of wear and tear. so i look up the 2nd version, slim and lite, on amazon. And i find this. at first, i thought there was a big logo on the back for madden, and not being a big football fan, i thought against purchasing it. but i look at the pictures, and where i expected to find a big helmet or something on the back, there was nohting, just shiny blue.

now on to madden: as you have read, im not a football fan. i am definatly not the ""get the new version every year"" kind of guy. but i try it, and it seems like they expected people to be new at it. They put a ""rookie mode"" to all the game modes, and its easy, fast, and fun gameplay.

beats: People don't really know what this is before they play it, so let me explain. Beats is like dance dance revolution max, press the button in sync with the music to score mega points. But beats adds something, you get to use your own music in your psp, whether its from a pc, or a cd. And in case you don't have any, they have pre-loaded tracks that will do until you get some. the game mode where you can make your own rythems is kinda comfusing, and i haven't figured it out yet.

the movie: its basically a short doc. on fameous football players, so, that is really up for you to decide.

for the whole package:
pros-shiny blue, lightweight,durable, Madden 09 is user friendly, beats is good to pass the time,

cons:beats takes a long time to download from the ps store, beats can get a little tiring to your eyes and brain, and the movie ain't all that great.","nice color, nice football game, i love sony",1218499200,17,,

The need for revenge, and the hard choice to pair up with a sworn enemy. You build up skills as you go, learning more about your enemy and finding ways to defeat them.
From a strategy point of view, the game is amazing. It's based on the Dynasty Warriors gameplay which is brilliant. The use of maps, of health information, and gathering new weapons and powers is very similar. I've always loved the Dynasty Warriors map, with the way it lays out the enemy locations, your location and your objectives.
The graphics are quite nice - the textured grass, shading on rocks, details on the bodies all draw you into the world you're inhabiting. The sounds are good as well. Even the voices are rather good, making you feel the emotions of the characters.
There's really something to be said for being able to leap on a dragon, fly up into the sky, and then let loose a flame barrage on your enemies!
I highly recommend this if you're into RPGs and strategy gaming - it brings the two worlds together quite nicely!",Great Fusion of RPG and Strategy,1079136000,24,,

When they do as good a job as they do on Grand Theft Auto III, then there is a masterpiece let loose upon the gaming world. State of Emergency is one such game, Why? you ask. The concept of the game is essentially that the country has been seized by an evil oppressive corporation and you have to do missions throughout in order to cause chaos and havoc. The game is essentially mission-based taking away from the free-roaming that was given in GTA III. But, the fact that there can be about 200 people on the screen at once adds to the fun of being a face in the crowd...but still a dangerous one. The graphics are cartoonish, but still impressive. The Entertainment and Playability are good as the controls respond really well when you fight among the rioters and it's fun to play.

5.0,False,"07 13, 2015",ATGF15CW10QO8,B00PB9LZQI,Colin,"I am an old school, original fan of the 2000 N64 Majora's Mask. It was, at the time, one of my favorite games of all time and it still is. Back then I dreamt of a time when the game would have enhanced graphics, be more realistic looking, have better lighting, etc. Well ,15 years later, ( a long time!) that time has finally come, and it is amazing!!!

  Initially I was skeptical about the graphical fidelity of the 3DS. It is the lowest powered of the current major consoles. ""I'll get it when they release a proper HD version on the Wii U"", I thought to myself.

  But after doing a full play through of Majora's Mask 3D I can confidently say that it probably looks BETTER than it would on an HD console. The 3D functionality is seriously impressive. I actually got a 3DS just to play this game and am very much surprised by how crisp and gorgeous this game is. The 3D adds an element that I couldn't have imagined back when I was dreaming in the year 2000! If you just stop and look at the scenery It is actually kind of breath taking. Especially if you compare this to the original n64 game. My fairy's sparkles feel like they are touching my eyes when I run around and the depth of everything when jumping is mind blowing. All of the menu items sort of look like they are floating in front of you when you go through them.

  I don't mean to set your expectations too high, but I think if you play it yourself you will be impressed, especially if you are a fan of the game.

  I should also mention that I played this on a new 3DS so I can't comment on how the load times or 3D functionality would be on a normal 3DS. Another thing is that I use the thumb stick on the New 3DS A LOT. How cool is it that Majora's Mask 3D has a freely movable camera! It adds a lot to the game and I seriously use it constantly when I play this game.

  As far as the game play goes It did take me some time to get used to the new control scheme with the bottom touch screen and the different button names. Once I did get used to it I felt like a master. Everything was fluid and I was changing masks and using items very easily. This game has been awesomely streamlined in many cool ways , but also feels just like the original game. The bank was moved to a much more convenient location. Some simply tedious temple design has been revamped. The map is SUPER helpful this time. The Bomber's notebook is way more helpful for getting the most out of this game.

That is another thing that impresses me so much about this game is that , yes, we got the graphical upgrade, but we also got SO much more in terms of optimization and removing some of the tedious aspects to let the great things about this game shine.

Some people are purists and prefer the original. I personally think this version is better in every way and have almost no desire to play the original as long as I have this one.

This game is so good that I can hardly believe it.  It'sin my dreams.  I've been playing for 2 weeks straight, and I just can't stop.

5.0,False,"12 24, 2014",A1OUKEY9UYTV3H,B00ECOBFA4,David Allen,"I've been hooked on the Lego game now for many years. I've watched them progress from simple to more mature and difficult games depending on the subject matter. In recent games such as The Hobbit and Super Heroes the game because more of a challenge and was not fun not being able to get 100% complete. Insane jump sequences, and ridiculous driving or flying sequences ruined those games. I did not know what to expect with The Movie game, but I was hoping that the developers got back to their roots of making the game winnable and fun again.

If your used to the themed games like the Hobbit or Lord of The Rings, and Batman etc, you will be taken back by the childlike setting and music of this game. But do not let that fool you. The game is a ton of fun to play and you can follow almost the entire game through without having to get a hint. As is typical with Lego games, you'll have several worlds to explore and tons of things to break. You will also meet and collect lots of characters many of which have special powers of course. I was able to power through the Story Mode levels in a single day. Transversing through the levels is intuitive especially if your used to how the Lego games play. The main Hub is Bricksburg and has your travel ports to the sub levels related to that area. This area also has the ports to the last sub levels because the story begins and ends in Bricksburg. There is one portal that leads to the West Town, and in West Town you will find the sub level ports and the portal to go to the Cloud levels. In the cloud levels you'll find the portals to the sub levels and off to the right there is a ramp that leads you to the Underword and its sub levels. Not sure why they didn't do a regular portal there and one to get out of the Underworld. Finding the portal to the next level is difficult because of the blooper in the portals starting at Cloud. But basically, each level is a Hub and has portals to the sub levels and the next Hub.

Characters are very easy to control, and do what you command. They are fairly easy to learn which abilities they have and what those can do with different objects. Most characters you unlock can be found in Bricksburg. The rest you should easily cross paths with in the other Hubs. The difficult ones are Emmit - Shower which is in the Underworld, and Emmit - Woodsman who is way up high in the Cloud Hub.

All red bricks are obtained in  the Bricksberg Hub. Most of the challenges are very easy with a few taking some time to figure out. Once you get the stud multipliers your on your way to buying every Red Brick and Character easily. The Bricksberg Hub is the best one for obtaining the most studs.

There is a Bonus room you can access from the portal in Bricksberg. You will need to complete a series of easy challenges and rack up 1 million studs to win the extra 10 gold bricks. Its best to head here after you have obtained all of the Gold Instruction Pages for at least one level as you need them to build the vehicle and use it.

The collectibles for this game are Gold Instruction Sheets. You'll have to collect 5 for each sub level in each hub. You will also have to collect a special item in each sub level as well. It is a pair of pants. You can change to any pants you've found at any time during the game at a PantsChangerStation. Of course no Lego game would be complete without Gold Bricks. You obtain these as a reward for completing each goal in each sub level. You'll need to get the Pants, 5 Gold Instructions, Complete the level in Story Mode, and get a full Awesome Bar which is the yellow stud bar that slowly fills as you collect studs during game play of that level. These go fast if you have a few stud multipliers on.

The most difficult part of the game for me was entering West World. You had to travel through a colorful tunnel with objects coming and going and stud rings and turns until you free fall down through the clouds and land on the top of a steep mountain slope. You then start sliding down hill and have to collect studs and avoid most objects. Most, because along the way down you have to spot bags on a post and you'll need to quickly get under them and jump to grab them. You'll need to grab 5 of them to get the Gold Instruction Page for this area. It gets better, as your grabbing the bags, you'll go through a mine and on the way out have to stay on the rail line and jump over missing sections to get another Gold Instruction Page. Prepare to be frustrated with those two goals and the whole sequence. You can start over and over if you like, but that brings me to my only complaint. This game takes for ever to load levels. You'll sit there for a good two minutes waiting for the level to load. With these challenges its even more frustrating because then you have to go through all that tunnel nonsense to get back to the slide part. Once you have those two pieces the game is a piece of cake from there. Very fun, very forgiving.",Surprisingly Fun!!!,1419379200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It just kept going on and on with all of these sequels coming in stores. The weakest one of the NES bunch, however, is Mega Man 5. Now, don't get me wrong. Mega Man 5 is still a very great game. But compared to all the other Mega Mans on the same console, this one just wasn't worth it for most fans. I lost hope when I heard that this just wasn't good enough. Fortunately for me, I loved it as much as the rest.

While the music doesn't sound too lively, the series' signature graphics and basic gameplay still shine through greatly. Unfortunately, the gameplay has been hampered by the fact that most of the bosses' powers are terrible. The Power Stone misses everything, the Charge Kick rarely does anything, Star Man's stars are worthless in most cases, and the list would go on. Whatever you do, just stick with your regular power. Even Rush isn't so great here.

Although you do have to face those flaws, that still doesn't mean the overall game is bad. The level design is still just as creative as in the other games, and there's still a good challenge in the game. Speaking of challenge, that is kinda lowered down, too. You get a bigger chance of getting extra lives and health restorers. That way, both newbies and long-time Mega Man fans can enjoy the game. I also like how you have to collect M-E-G-A-M-A-N-V letters for a little something extra. It reminds me of how you must collect Chaos Emeralds in the Sonic games for secret endings.

All the flaws that I mentioned may be major to some fans, but for me, those are minor complaints.

First of all, if you are an all-time fan of this series and just want to collect everything about God of War, go ahead and buy it. I mean this is an amazing series, and the cinematic action scene in this series is just unprecedented by any other PS games. Please be age 17+ to buy this game. LOL

Second, if you already played PS3 version this game and just wanna check out the new graphics and see what PS4 console is capable of expanding this game, go ahead and buy it. The graphics are amazing on PS4. Lets put it this way, it is just like back in the days when you only had PS2, and then PS3 came out. You would be amazed by the graphics. But lets be honest, there isn't  much going on with the storyline, nor the music. You are probably already familiar with the control, so nothing new there either.

Third, if you are a first time God of War series player, and just want to learn this game, dude, definitely buy it! I mean, if you are over age 17 and like bloody scene and strong violence video game. GOW is a game changing production in this genre. Well, in my opinion, GOW 1 was, but the later series are not as much an eye-opener. Nevertheless, it is still way better than most of the console games out there.

If you don't fit into any of those categories I just described, my suggestion is don't buy it. Just watch some gameplay videos online first and figure out what the game is about.",Gamers can't miss this,1436832000,39,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'},

I never purchased a Wii, and haven't owned a Nintendo product since Game Boy when I was a young lad.  I played Mario Kart at a friends house on the Wii, I loved the game but it just never grabbed me enough to purchase a console to play it on.  Recently I sold my Xbox 360 and PS3 to get an Xbox One...never made the purchase and have been console-less for a quite some time.

I just noticed Mario Kart 8 was coming out for Wii U and I decided to look in to it.  The visuals look amazing, and there is no denying the amount of fun you can have with ""party"" games like this.  I went ahead and purchased a new black Wii U, and Mario Kart...I never thought I'd say this but its a game changer!  First off the game looks much better when you actually see it on your HDTV, everything is crisp and colorful...vibrant is a word that comes to mind!  The gamepad is honestly one of my favorite parts of Wii U so far, the second screen just adds so much to the experience, and being able to see the track in my hand is awesome!

My girlfriend and I played for a few hours, just checking out the tracks and characters (we both grew up with Mario on NES).  The competition is fierce and with so many characters and tracks to choose fun we only quit cause we had to head to work.  I'm not a Wii advocate, and I've literally only owned the console and game for a few hours so I cant provide a full review.  From what I'm seeing so far whether your a Mario Kart connoisseur or a first time player you will love this game.  I will update here if I find anything that could change my vote from 5 stars, but honestly the fun I had in those couple hours well warrant the 5 stars and make me happy I purchased both the Wii U and Mario Kart 8!

Update (6/2/14)  So I had a weekend to play with my Wii U (I know I know) and I gotta say I should have bought a Wii U when it was first released.  We packed the Wii up and brought it to my girlfriends parents house.  First off her nephew had a blast playing his old Wii games, and the family was blown away by Mario Kart!  I had originally planned to ""show off"" the game, but it ended up being a 4 hour 4 player split screen grudge match!  Everybody had a blast and it reinforced my decision to purchase the Wii.  Her dad was also impressed by the game pad screen and ability keep playing if the TV was needed for something else.

Don't even think about purchasing Mario Kart, and if you don't have a Wii U purchase Mario Kart the same day you pick up the new Wii U :)  Awesome console and game...both made me a believer!","Wow, what a game!",1401408000,49,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"11 19, 2004",AGKJU4CBYSY1Y,B0002ILS1K,Dennis Laycock,"I've always had a penchant for Nintendo over other video game companies, and playing Paper Mario, I figured out why.

Games made by Nintendo have a very strong sense of nostalgia that really appeals to me, since I've been playing video games since the Atari 2600 days.  Nintendo has been working with these characters (Mario, the Princess, Bowser) for 20 years now, and each new game manages to reference all the other games in clever ways.

For example, in Paper Mario, much of the music is from older games -- not just the famous Mario theme, but a lot of other, more obscure stuff, too.  The dialogue constantly parodies older games.  When we first meet Bowser in this game, he climbs in his clown-faced ship and zooms toward the screen, then away into the distance, just like he did in Super Mario World (SNES), back when scaling and rotation were amazing new tricks.

But the nostalgia is just a small part of the fun here.  Paper Mario features turn-based battles, where you must strategize in using different items and attacks and defending yourself against enemies.  I've played only two other games of this style -- Super Mario RPG and Chrono Trigger -- but I'm told those are two of the best example.  Paper Mario equals if not tops the great battles of those games.

The gameplay outside of battle is innovative, with lots of challenges to figure out -- but none so hard that you'll ever be stuck for long.  I really liked how you play as different characters at different times (including Bowser and the Princess), and the romantic subplot between the Princess and a HAL-like computer is hilarious.  You even get to ""dance"" with a computer-generated Princess clone (and take a shower afterwards if you like).

There's a lot of innovative touches in the graphics, too.  I love how the walls of houses collapse when you step through the door, allowing you to see inside.  The spiraling stairs of the first castle look amazing, and I like how, at times, pipes will take Mario into the distant background of a level.  I'm surprised there's no slowdown in some scenes, such as when you're mobbed by hundreds of Skeleton Koopas, or are being followed by 101 Punies (the giant tree level is the most clever level in any recent game I can think of).

Some might complain that the graphics are too ""cartoony,"" but to me, they're perfect.  If I want ""realistic"" graphics, I'll watch TV or see a movie.  Games that create new worlds and new ideas my eyes have never seen before are much better than those that just re-create stuff I see every day.

Paper Mario is another triumph from Nintendo, and once again strengthens my loyalty.  Nintendo may be losing the video-game wars, but they still know how to make a good game better than anyone else.",This is why I love Nintendo,1100822400,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Your thumb fits perfectly into the groove on the left side of the mouse which gives a feeling of control.  The two side buttons are located right above where your thumb rests so it is easy to find them and easy to press the right one.

When you aren't gaming the mouse doesn't feel as though it's bristling with buttons. The buttons are rounded so they don't dig into your hand. Some gaming mice are so full of features I for one get easily flummoxed as I can't think quickly enough to plug in the appropriate feature and these over-stocked mice just aren't feasible for everyday use whether or not you are gaming. The G400 is not as customizable as other gaming mice and may not be feature rich enough for professional gamers, but for most people it should be very adequate.

The DPI sensitivity is controlled by three buttons one above, two below the scroll wheel and the scroll wheel itself. Increasing and decreasing the sensitivity while you're playing, adjusting the sensitivity as you scroll 3600, 1800, 800 and 400 dpi is smooth and easy. This mouse is also the most smooth-sliding on the mouse pad I have ever had, it slides almost as though the bottom were waxed. Unless you wish a highly customizable mouse, the G400 is perfect for most people, gamers or not, who simply do not need a mouse with features that are often over-kill.","Comfortable, highly responsive mouse",1325894400,,,

After impressing critics and fans alike for its amazing third person gameplay and being incredibly replayable, Dead Space 2 comes back to reclaim its throne of survival horror. But is it as good as the first one?

Dead Space 2 takes everything that was so good from the first game, fixes its few flaws (wonky stomp mechanic, no more!), adds more content, improves the already great graphics, and gets rid of the cheap jump scares and replaces them with truly disturbing scenarios involving Isaac's developing dementia.

Speaking of which, the story of Dead Space 2 now takes place several years after the original game on the floating city dubbed ""The Sprawl."" Throughout the game, Isaac is haunted by the events of the first while trying to figure out why the government won't leave him alone. His story of survival is a mature, detailed one; something many games that share the title ""survival horror"" lack.

The gameplay of Dead Space 2 is also very, very fun. The controls have been modified to be much friendlier to the player. You can now reload while not aiming your gun, melee enemies quicker, and use your telekinesis module as a weapon in itself for when ammo gets scarce (and on higher difficulties, IT WILL). This makes the overall game much more enjoyable, and it still has the New-Game+ feature, allowing you to play through the game again to find more advanced gear while also improving the gear you already had. This makes the 8-11 hour (varies depending on the difficulty) campaign much, much longer, and much more rewarding when you get the last suit in the game.

Dead Space 2 is a massive improvement over the already near perfect first game. Buy this game right away if you have any interest in horror.","""Isaac... Follow the Steps....""",1394236800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The only reason you have to see the movie before you buy this game is because the game completely gives away the movie. It's just like watching the movie on your DS. Other than that the game is perfect.

Graphics: Outstanding graphics for a DS game. I've seen some of the other games for DS and their graphics aren't nearly as good as these. Multiplayer mode (the place where you fly ships) looks almost as good as a PSP game, except whan you blow up, then it looks it was from a coloring book.

Controls: Very basic, very easy. Sometimes I might try to block a low attack with L down and accidently hit R down and choke him to death, but who cares. Starship controls are complicated, I changed mine the first time I played it.

Multiplayer: Awesome, sort of. You can only play multiplayer with starships which is why its only sort of awesome. I've always wanted to duel my friend and show him I'm just as good with a lightsaber as I am with a starship, but that's why we have PS2.

5.0,False,"10 13, 2015",A2AUO62GFRZI2N,B00SVVUOGU,Mykl,"Stuff youve read elsewhere that Ill reinforce:  graphics are incredible, rain is wow, nice selection of cars.

The first thing thats important to me in a console racer is accessibility.  Meaning, the game has to be easy to pick up and put down with little effort, and for me that means being able to use a gamepad instead of having to drag a wheel/pedal stand out of the closet.  In this aspect, Forza may well be the very best console racer of all time.  The developers have managed to allow for each cars unique characteristics to shine through, even while using a gamepad.  For reference, I drive with ABS on & the normal steering setting, other aids are switched off.  The steering is dialed in as well as Ive experienced for a gamepad and I never want to play another racer without the trigger rumble again.  In fact, the throttle and brake control with a  gamepad are probably better than you're likely to experience with an actual pedal setup.

Years ago I had a 2004 Subaru STi.  I had a fair amount of seat time at track days as well as dozens of autocross events over the years.  Amazingly, the STi in Forza.  feels like an STi.  It understeers a bit coming out of corners at part throttle, then at full throttle as the three differentials lock up it gets sideways and goes into an easy to control four wheel drift.  I can get nit-picky and go on about the details that aren't perfect, but the fact that its as close as it is kind of amazes me.

Another thing that I look for out of a console racer is for it to convey a sense of speed, and this is another area where Forza excels.  I believe this is in large part to the excellent sound built into the game.  Going back to the STi thing  it sounds like an STi.  The sound is as close as Ive ever heard any game get to feeling like you're in a real car, I cant think of another game that does it better.  In my mind, the only games Ive felt a better sense of speed would be the old Colin McRae Rally games, which were excellent.  The best track to experience this in Forza is the Nurburgring, a track which is modeled on a number of other games.  The real Nurburgring has some pretty extreme elevation changes, something that most other titles don't seem to accurately convey to the player.  Forza nails it, I have never had more fun trying to figure out how to get around this track while dealing with traffic.

Forza isn't the game you go to when you want a serious, authentic racing experience, nor is it the title you go to when you want a goofy fun arcade feel to your drive.  Its somewhere in between, theres just enough sim mixed in, while removing some of the more tedious aspects of the more genuine simulations that are out there.  It provides a great balance thats easy to get into for the casual gamer, but still satisfying for those whose tastes lean towards the hard core, who just want to get in a quick and easy fix instead of the hours it can take to practice and prepare for something like a high level iRacing session.

Things I wish were here.

A series configuration tool.  Such as, if I wanted to create my own hot hatch series, setting the performance value of each car, setting points values for each finishing position, setting the number of races/laps, setting the order each track is run, etc.

In the absence of this, something like Gran Turismo has, where they push different events for people to participate that you can access online.  Something, anything to better extend the replay value for after youve gone through the career mode.

Something to make the career mode races a bit more dynamic, like being able to set the desired race length.  I understand that the developers didn't want this to be a slog, but two lap races on some tracks are.  just not enough.  When I feel like I have to jam my car through the first couple of corners on the first lap to pick up 4-5 spots to have a shot at actually winning the race, its just not long enough.

A look through the corner view.  As in, having the view shift slightly to allow you to see all the way through a curve as you drive through it.

Overall though, I love it.  Id recommend it for anyone who enjoys racing games.",Among the best console racers ever made,1444694400,4,,

I bought StarTech Headset adapter for headsets with separate headphone / microphone plugs  3.5mm 4 position to 2x 3 position 3.5mm M/F. (Pictures posted of the adapter are in my full review so you can make sure you buy the right kind) Which successfully bridges the two microphone and audio cords on the gaming headphones so that you can plug them into your device. I successfully tested this combo on our PS4, Xbox360, WiiU, Iphone, Ipod, and a Kyocera Android phone.

If you don't intend to use the microphone the Arrow is perfect because the microphone pieces slides in to the earpiece; out of sight out of mind. You don't have to plug in the microphone for the audio cable to work.

The Sentey Arrow headphones are a tad more comfortable than the Sentey Flow headphones because the earpiece fully covers your ear instead of resting on top of your ear. This reduces pressure to your ears, especially if you wear glasses as the earpieces on the Arrow headphones don't compress on your glasses.

The cord length is very versatile. Its long enough for PC use so that you can plug it in and still move around. Its also not so long that you have way too much cord sitting in your lap if you have it plugged in to a controller or cellphone. Its designed with a longer cord so some excess cord is expected for controller or cellphone applications. The cord itself is braided so it won't pinch & short out. Unlike the Sentey Audio Cable Stereo 3.5mm I reviewed, this cord is insulated and the noise from movement doesn't transfer through the cable or headset.

TL;DR

Pros:
Mic can be folded into the ear piece
Very comfortable for long periods of time
Braided cable which is durable
Good sound quality w/ inline adjustable volume control
Option to turn the chat function off entirely
Great noise cancelling

Cons:
Console or phone applications require an adapter that is not supplied by Sentey
Cable is designed for PC gaming some users might find it too long (I dont)

As a port, this is about as accurate as you can get, with the game itself untouched.  The only thing missing is that there's no simultaneous 2-player 'battle mode' possible since it's restricted to a single 3DS, but you can still do the 2 player pass-the-controller type of play to progress through the game.

With the usual Virtual Console enhancements of adding save-states and the ability to suspend the game to play later at any time, it's added a lot of modern convenience to a true classic NES title.

As for the game itself, Mario Bros 3 expands on the original Super Mario Bros formula with a huge variety of new worlds, enemies, powerups, and boss fights.  With an art style that's aged incredibly well for 8-bit pixel gaming, Super Mario Bros 3 still manages to feel like a fresh experience even today.  There's tons of levels to explore, every world has a unique look and gimmick, and you can even find some cool secrets that let you skip around in the game at will.

I don't even play RE5 on PS3 even though I bought it, because I don't have the right mindset for it right now. I don't know much more than where the game stood from part Zero (this one) and part 2, but I know that both used the survival horror techniques that started the genre. From what I know also, the gameplay in current games have differed from this, some say for the better, I say not necessarily.

Now, I would first recommend getting this one because it stands as the best in the series in its classic form of gaming because 1) you get to spend time looking around and admiring the scenery that seems so authentic you can breathe it 2) live the music 3) because you won't go through x amount of lives by being bombarded with zombies so much in one scene 4) the enemies are NOT so overwhelming that you miss out on the rest of the graphic effects 5) it's not a repetitive game and the rest goes on.

This is the first RE that I went all the way through on, and what this typically means for the player is plenty of nights with the lights off and getting a feel for the story. It isn't too extreme, some parts pick up the pace, and overall it's a good game from one amazement to the next.

I think that the gameplay changed a lot with part 4 and 5 because the way it stood was a little formulaic in that the bosses got worse the deeper you got into it, up to a finale that depending on the voice acting you were either convinced by the story or not. From what I remember, everything was good in that respect, with part 0, making this the best of the classic REs.

Now, what I'd like to see is this game be released on other platforms, because a game like this does have some replay value after being away from it, providing a nostalgia. Even a PSP could probably handle this one.

As for the content you get Halo: CE with both original/remastered graphics, Halo 2 with both original/remastered graphics, and both Halo 3 and Halo 4 in their original graphics. All are in 60 fps at 1080p if your screen supports it. As you play through, the graphics in 1 and 2 are beautiful, as well as 4 (even though techincally the remastered graphics of 2 are now better than 4's, I prefer the graphics in 4 the most) and then there is 3...On a straight play through if you continue through the games, you may find Halo 3 from a graphical stand point to be left behind, given that it has a major drop out as it has not received the HD graphic overhaul the first two have had. Other than that you can play solo/co-op on all missions, and ALL skulls are available for use out of the box. Additionally, terminals are now hidden and available for achievements in all 4 games and skulls are hidden for achievements in the first three games. Guaranteed the nostalgia and butterflies you will re-experience as you go through the iconic moments in the early Halo games will be worth the money alone.

Additionally you will get access to the Halo 5 multiplayer beta from Dec 29-Jan 18th, which I am definitely looking forward to. You also get free access to watch Halo Nightfall, which is still be released progressively. It details the journey of Agent Locke who will be a major hitter and likely playable character in next year's Halo 5: Guardians. It is very well done from the episodes I have watched thus far, a better series in my opinion than Forward unto Dawn was.

Lastly, you get the multiplayer. Despite what many of complained, and complained...and complained about, they are fixing the online play. Since getting the game on Black Friday, I have had only one problem getting into an online match, and that was before the last 3 updates which have majorly improved play. Now I don't have to wait anymore than I do for Halo matches back on the 360. Many of the maps are either true to their original forms in 1-4, or they have been updated and modernized. Its a real throwback getting to play some of the maps, like Lockdown, from Halo 2 any old fan will instantly feel at home in. Currently the only ranked matches are Halo 2, but they are updating every few days.

The controls now, are a major learning curve, at least as I found. I still have a hard time remembering that I can't just sprint in 1-3, lol, often resulting in death. They do have a controller setting, I forget the name off hand, that you can set so that the controls remain the same through all 4 games, which makes it vastly easier, given that until 3 you won't have any useable items like the pop-up shields or grav-lifts, and you won't have armor abilities until you play on 4 (which I believe means you won't use X or left bumper till 3 or 4). Makes for more smooth game transition and only a quick glance at what game you are playing, depending on the play list.

If you are worried, the campaign alone is worth it, but if you are only in it for the multiplayer, it is far to difficult to tell if it will work for you specifically.

Lastly, the game does require 90gb, at least for the digital download version, I'm not sure about the disc version. It took me forever to download the entire game (most of 2 days and based on my download speed, it shouldn't have actually taken more than 1.5 hours...). So be sure you have good internet and time on hand before you play. The multiplayer will also have 4+ updates you will now need before even jumping online, though they might all be combined for first timers now.

Kim,"I've been fan of this series since it first came out on the NES and since then KOEI has produced a great cult classic that has gained popularity over the years.  With their lastest edition, they have made vast changes over the last two in the series.  I really like the new map structure which is really more different than any of the previous games in the series.  It's more realistic and shows movement, plus the ability to add structures outside the existing cities.  They went back to their old formula where you can only play Rulers.  While I really enjoyed playing all officers in parts VII and VIII, I'm happy to see the old formula back in action.  The years have also been expanded, now instead of going month to month, the months are even split into 3 periods.  The battle in the game has become more tactical and there are many added features.  Though there are different formations and such, I felt that they simplified the war sequences which makes it more practical.  All in all, I felt that KOEI really put together a great strategy sequel that is more different than any of the previous games but at the same time maintained the integrity of the series very well.  If your a fan of the series, the changes are really refreshing and I'd really recommend picking this up.  If you were a casual gamer of previous versions, I'm sure that you would enjoy this installment much more than any of the previous also.  But if you're new to the series, I'll just say, it's not for everyone.  If you tend to only like action-oriented games and visual eye-candy, then this is definately not your game.  If your interested in ""turn-based"" historical simulations that are heavily strategic,  both on the battlefield and domesticly, then this would be something of interest.",The Dragon sheds his skin,1077753600,28,,

The plot for Mario Party 2is actually a play. All the characters are acting (and it shows when you beat all the stages). The play goes as Mario and friends are trying to figure out a name for their land. Because Mario is the leader, he chooses his name but Wario isn't pleased by this and calls it Wario Land. Eventually a fight breaks out and even though Peach thinks solving the issue means changing it to her name, the fighting actually gets pretty chaotic (and as a kid its hilarious given the obvious anime falling down style and Toads near face palm moment if his hands could reach his head.) Bowser on the other hand is terrozing the citizens of the land and Toad have to step in to stop the fighting. Toad tells the cast that the person who defeats Bowser will be named the Superstar and get to choose the title of the land thus Mario and the group rush off to defeat Bowser.

The six stages in the game are all part of the play. You have pirate land (pirates), western land (cowboys), space land (space police), mystery land (archeologists), horror land (witches/sorcerers/wizards) and Bowser land. The goal is the same as in the first game to have the most stars to win. However because this is a play, the groups goal is stated at the beginning of each map: defeat Bowser who is terrorizing the citizens of the land and Bowser has a different outfit and occupation depending on the board. On the game board, you cannot stop Bowser from causing harm but only the winner gets to face off against Bowser and win.

Mario Party 2 is the most progressive of all the Mario Party games with all that has been added. Battle mini games are introduced where the players but give a set amount of coins to Goomba and battle it out. 1st and 2nd place tend to get all the coins leaving 3rd with 1 coin if lucky and 4th place with nothing (unless your Peach then the game pities her to give that 1 coin to her instead). Items are introduced in this game where you can buy them at item shops or win a mini game (which changes depending on the map) to obtain an item. These range from mushrooms to move around the board faster with two or three dice to the warp block that trades places with someone at random. Duel mini games were also introduced here where during the last five turns or if you have the dueling glove, you duel another player for a set amount of coins (and its different based on the game board).
Many of the mini games were recycled from the first game but with changes to make the game less punishing to players (such as losing coins if you were picked up in the crane game) or modified to make the game more exciting like bumper balls. Most of the fan favorite mini games come from Mario Party 2 and is where the Luigi Wins by Doing Nothing is introduced by AI stupidity. Also if you want to play the mini games, the coins you win on the game board converted by the amount of stars and coins the player have, you must buy them (and you cant do anything else in mini game mode without buying a set amount of games).
The board maps are also very creative and themed as mentioned above. The most memorable one is horror land as it is the only board with a day and night setting that ramps the difficulty of the board. Horror lands day and night mechanic would go on to being the main selling point of Mario Party 6.

And unlike Mario Party 1, Mario Party 2 is on the Wii Virtual console for 1000 points (or was it 1500 points?) So if you want the game, its available at a cheap price. This is honestly the most memorable game of the Mario Party series for me because of how much was added compared to later games that seem to be a hit or miss depending on what the new features are.",One of the Best Mario Party games in the Series,1396051200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The graphics are just as beautiful as they need to be, the story is good, the combat is entertaining, the magic effects lovely to look at...

There's a bit of micromanagement if you try to perfect things, because there are ""rings"" and ""accessories"" that you can wear, and to optimize combat you will be changing them a lot (since combat typically mixes the kinds of enemies at once). Also, since you have more characters than characters that can be active... and since there is a benefit to levelling up ""mortals"" (so they learn skills) and the ""immortals"" (so they learn skills /from the mortals/)... you will find yourself visiting the menu a lot. The menu could have been streamlined more, but it's manageable.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those poor schlubs that spend all his time in a virtual world, cursing out people on the net from the safety of a computer desk. I enjoy a healthy social life, and engage in as much fun as the law will allow. Meeting new people is fun, and forming relationships has always come easy for me. And though I generally don't like talking on the phone, I never screen my calls. I figure if someone took the time to call me, then who am I to ignore them.

I hate answering the phone now. Commander Shepherd just stands there in silence awaiting a command while I have to endure mind-numbing chatter about events I could care less about from the other end of the line. Didn't I tell the other person when they asked what I was up to that I was playing Mass Effect? Did that not imply that I would rather be playing a game than helping you decide what color you should dye your hair? And, no, I don't want to come over and watch a movie when I'm practically playing one now.

Now I'm sure that the novelty of the game will wear off eventually, and by eventually I mean probably after Christmas. Which is good, because I would like to overcome the addiction by New Year's, but for now I'm going to live the life of a malnourished sleep-deprived hermit?

We have had one since launch and we LOVE it and play it far more than we ever touch our Wii or PS3. This review is specifically about our upgrade to an XBox 360 elite.

The Xbox 360 Elite - with its shiny black case - is the latest version of the Xbox 360 with several important upgrades. First, it comes with a 120 gig hard drive, which is very important for people who love to download games, music and movies. Next, it comes with a built in HDMI port!

First, the disk space. We got an Xbox 360 base unit right when it first came out, and we play *constantly*. It was very easy to get those 20 gig of space on the basic hard drive filled up with all sorts of things. We had music to play as background music in some games, we had lots of game demos we were trying out. We had videos to watch and downloadable games from the marketplace. We definitely needed more space.

For graphics, we can easily notice that the video quality from the HDMI feed is better than what we were getting from the high def feed on the regular Xbox 360. The regular one offers component (red-green-blue) as its only high def feed. So if you're a gamer with a high def TV and want the best quality signal, you'll be happy about this HDMI output.

Yes, you get a black wireless controller, a black headset and Live Silver membership along with this package. But really, most Xbox gamers have those things already. And most of them have Gold Live, since without Gold you can't play online. So these three things are certainly nice to have, but not a reason you would buy the Elite system.

The package comes with a single disc containing 2 games - Forza and Marvel Ultimate Alliance. Both are old games and not that thrilling; we had them already. Still, free games are at least things you can give away to friends.

Perhaps best of all, the Elite has a new motherboard inside it which is much more reliable. It's called a FALCON. How can you tell what motherboard your Xbox 360 has? Here's the trick.  It works for any 360

* Turn your 360 off and take off the hard drive and remove the game.
* Turn the unit upside down.
* Put a flashlight directly against the bottom grill.
* Look in from the SIDE grill at the inside of your 360.

If you see 3 red rings that ""stick up"" from the green motherboard, you have an old launch motherboard. If you see 3 red rings that ""lay flat"" on that motherboard, it's the middle Zephyr version. If you have only TWO red rings that lay flat, you've got a Falcon!

I highly recomend having an Xbox 360 in your house for gaming, and I highly recommend going with the Elite. The hard drive space is VERY useful, the HDMI graphics are great, and having a 360 in general is just superb.  Again, we literally play with the 360 all the time and rarely touch our other systems. The whole reason we had to get an Elite is that we were fighting over who could play on the 360 even though we have all these other game systems in the house.

Basically it removes the approval system from the game by allowing you to change the person's approval instantly to whatever you want at a fairly low silver cost.

Other than that the story is interesting so far and the combat is a lot of fun. It is actually somewhat linear because it will open up an area to try and give it an open world feel but block off the path to only provide you with one way to go. My only complaint is certain things reward you for doing the wrong thing with no consequence in the story, which just makes it feel less real.

I am also somewhat of a Nintendo fan (though I love games in general). This is a great system regardless of your background, though, if the price isn't too offputting and if your hands are OK with the small system.

The hardware here performs similarly to the other members of the GBA family. There is one difference from the GBA and GBA SP, though: this is not backwards compatible with GB/GBC games. If this interests you, I would definitely recommend an AGS-101 GBA SP (the 101 models are backlit).

The software library is great, especially for Nintendo fans, with a wide variety of genres represented. I had forgotten how many great titles there were until I was typing out the list of my favorites below.

Some of my favorite titles (in no particular order):
Pokemon FireRed/ LeafGreen/ Ruby/ Sapphire
Tactics Ogre: Knights of the Lodis
Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
Advance Wars
Mother 3 (with English translation)
Metroid Zero Mission
Metroid Fusion
Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap
Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
Castlevania: Circle of the Moon
Final Fantasy VI
Golden Sun
Mario Kart
NES Classics series (particularly Zelda 1)
Super Mario World Advance re-releases (1-4)

I would highly recommend this system to anyone that loves good games regardless of their age, especially if you love something that is highly portable (and actually fits in a normal-sized pocket).

Just as an aside if you are interested in buying GBA games: beware of fake games on eBay/ Amazon, especially if they are shipping from China, Hong Kong, etc. The bootleg games will typically be more error prone than the real deal, though they may be cheaper.",Supreme portability at a cost,1463356800,,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

Needless to say, my system I currently have is ""under"" the recommended system requirements. I say recommended, because the ""minimum"" will be inadequate to even get this game to run properly. There are ways around this, however (Oldblivion will alow you to run this game on older graphics cards), and this is what prompted me to buy it. I am totally hooked now by this game, and anyone who is a RPG fan will enjoy this. Below is my breakdown of the game:

Highs: The graphics are outstanding (even when tweaking this game, I'm totally impressed). Gameplay is smooth and combat a major plus. Atmospheric in it's entire presentation, Oblivion draws you in. I have audibly caught my breah on several occassions playing this game. Sound is exceptional, and properly executed where appropriate. Voice acting is spot on, and the ""radiant AI"" system makes the NPC's in the game come alive. A living, breathing world is yours to enjoy at your leisure. Finish the main quest when you choose. The ""sandbox"" gaming is a pleasure to experience, and you can complete the game when you feel it's time. Many hours of playability from the side quests to just exploring the countryside are yours to do with as you please.

Lows: Of course as everyone else has said, the system requirements will make your computer choke to death. Some (okay, lots) of glitchs are also around the game. Crashes are infrequent (for me, anyway), so always save your game at regular intervals. I recommend tweaking this game and getting the program ""Oldblivion"" for those of us that don't have the latest graphics cards. My machine: eMachine 2.93 ghz, 80 gb hard drive, GeForce FX5200 graphics card with Oldblivion installed and other mods to help with ""grass clipping"" and other issues. Runs at 89 fps indoors, around 30 fps outdoors (hint: turn anti aliasing OFF).

Overall: Great game with a little patience on your part. Once it runs to your satisfaction, you will be hooked in to the world of Oblivion. Hours in the outside world will pass without a trace. Don't forget to eat, sleep and drink on occasion, and yes, see your family and friends. Heck, get them involved in playing, too. :o)",Prepare to Enter Oblivion.....you will never be the same!,1173398400,4,,

This is an on rail shooting game and is one of the best-made so far.  It made some significant improvements from its successor Resident Evil - The Umbrella Chronicles:

- Graphic, voice acting and overall presentation: very nicely done.  The graphics are so neat you may be thinking that you are watching a movie or something.  Most characters, especially females, have an even better looking than their original images (especially Claire Redfield, she is way gorgeous in this title).  Voice acting enhanced by a great deal from the UC which had mediocre voice acting.
- Shooting accuracy & scoring system: headshots are more reasonable to perform compared to that in UC where a headshot is nearly a mission impossible.  The scores are also much more reasonable compared to UC.  I played UC very hard and I don't recall getting anything past a B.  In DC, you pretty much have an idea on what you'll get at the end by counting how many enemies you've missed, how many headshots you performed, and if you shot enemies down quickly enough.
- Switching/equiping weapon: I consider this the most critical improvement.  Rather than having to scroll through all your weapons until you find the right one in sequence, in DC you assign weapons to the four directions bottoms at your own will so you can quickly switch to the desired weapon by simply clicking on the designated direction bottom.  Unlike in UC where you're stuck with one extra weapon you select at the beginning of a stage and having to heavily rely on what you pick up during the stage, in DC you are also allowed to switch to any weapon you previously collected any time during the course of the stage.  And items like herbs, you now pick it up, keep it for as long as you want during any given stage, and use it as an inventory item rather than being forced to take it on the spot as you see one.
- Tuning up your weapon: also a very big improvement.  It now gives you much more flexibility in deciding what you really want to upgrade.  What's best, you can now fix up your best friend - handgun.  Ultimately, that's what you use for about 90% of the time, even against most of the bosses.  Machineguns which used to be a complete piece of junk in UC, is greatly improved into one of the most lethal weapons, especially against bosses.  Explosives (such as grenade, grenade launcher, and rocket launcher), on the other hand, become obsolete.  You'd think these are the ultimate weapons to bail you out of trouble in just one shot - wrong!  I once tried three grenades in attempt to put out a group of about 5~6 zombies; it throws them into the ground but they keep on coming back up, ended up costing me way more time than shooting them down one by one with my crafty little handgun.
- Storyline:  not much new stuff here, but gives die-hard RE fans a memorable recap of some of its prior titles.  Love the fact that most of them involve Claire, cuz man isn't she hot in this release.

If I were to point out some negative from my perspective, I would say 1). The shaky camera is really distracting; and 2). Some of the conversational or walking around scenes are way too slow, and they can't be skipped if it's not a cut-scene.

But overall, I give this game a 9.5/10 for its entertainment value and visual satisfaction as a rail shooting.  Nicely made!",Nicely made!,1288915200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

From top to bottom, this is a well polished presentation that offers Ghostbusters fans an opportunity to join the boys and really bust some heads, in a spiritual sense of course.

For the main story, players are cast in the role of the team's new recruit, pretty much there for the sole purpose of field testing all the new weapons and gadgetry, a job far too dangerous for a real Ghostbuster to be subjected to.  You get plenty of opportunity to show your stuff as a soon to open Gozer exhibit unleashes supernatural chaos on the good citizens of New York City.  Your character stays silent the entire game which allows you to experience the team's classic banter.  Along the way, you will find yourself revisiting familiar locales like the Sedgewick Hotel and the New York Public Library.  The firehouse headquarters serves as your hub between calls and you are allowed to explore it at your leisure.  Several familiar spooks including Slimer, the Librarian, Stay Puft and the painting of Vigo (which is an absolute blast to interact with) make welcome appearances.

This title is basically a third-person adventure/shooter.  The controls are pretty intuitive and equipment upgrades can be purchased to better help you as you progress throughout the game.  Enemy A.I. varies on the difficulty setting you are playing on.  There are a couple spots that are a bit tough to get through.  I'm not a hardcore gamer but I completed the story in about 6 hours, not counting the time spent wandering around the firehouse.  The game can also last longer depending on how much you want to explore and take more readings with you PKE Meter.  There are many online multiplayer co-op modes that I have not gotten a chance to try but they all sound really cool. You can also assume the roles of the actual Ghostbusters when in multiplayer.

The graphics can be quite stunning and really look the way a next-gen title should.  The characters look exactly the way you remember them from the movie aside from Janine, who has again changed her hairstyle.  The proton stream and the ghost trapping effects look perfect and the level of detail on the proton pack itself is really cool.  The lighting effects are excellent and the location designs are inventive and eerie.  The main cutscenes look like they were taken from a CGI film.

The sound of the game is really what cements this title as a true Ghostbusters experience.  Bill Murray, Dan Ayroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts are back to handle all your supernatural elimination needs.  Alyssa Milano appears as Venkman's new love interest, Brian Doyle-Murray portrays the new mayor of NYC and Bill Atherton is back as the slimy Walter Peck, who is now charged with the duty of helping the city to foot the bill for the damage the Ghostbusters cause.  The dialog is well written and will have you laughing out loud.

Most of the sound effects are straight out of the movie including the blaring siren of Ecto-1 (now the Ecto-1B), the proton packs and particle streams, and the various sounds of the spooks, specters and ghosts.  Some spots are really creepy like when you traverse through the children's section of the library and your return visit to the Sedgewick.  Spiritual voices and moans were coming at me from every speaker in my living room.

One detail of the game I was truly happy with and something I was hoping would be included was the use of Elmer Bernstein's great score from the original film for soundtrack.  I believe had he done the score for the second film it would have been a much better movie and would have been better received by audiences and critics.  One of the best things about the score being used here is that you get to hear sections of many cuts that were replaced by pop songs and therefore left out of the theatrical version of the film.  I own the limited edition score CD that was released a few years ago so I have heard it all before but many people will be hearing these tracks for the first time.  There is some original music in the game which blends in nicely for the most part.

I was fortunate enough to be able to pick up this title for both the PS3 and the Wii. Each version offers up a totally different experience.  The PS3, 360, and PC versions offer a more authentic movie feel, which can be a little more intense or frightening at times, while the Wii and PS2 versions are more suited for all ages and feel more like a cross between the movies with a little bit of The Real Ghostbusters cartoon thrown in, which is very fitting to the Wii.  Much of the content is the same in all versions but the layouts of each level are constructed differently and there may be a snippet of dialog that didn't make it into one version or the other for whatever reason.  Additionally, as great as the dialog is, much of it seems better suited to the more cartoonish versions, especially many of Bill Murray's deliveries, which are very funny but at times sound a bit too animated for the realistic next gen versions.  I highly recommend trying out both versions of the game if you are able to.

In closing, regardless of what platform you prefer, this game is cause to celebrate for Ghostbusters fans.  It was well worth the wait and I will be enjoying both versions for a long time to come.  The release of this game, along with the releases of the original film on Blu-ray and the complete series of The Real Ghostbusters on DVD, will hopefully help to re-ignite public excitement with the Ghostbusters franchise and get things rolling with rumors of a possible new movie.  Regardless, this game is a Ghostbusters fan's dream come true.","Yes, have some. (PS3 Review)",1245456000,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

Despite being a Japanese controller, it works perfectly fine on my North American Wii and Gamecube. Because it is brand new, the control sticks might start out a little stiff, but it shouldn't be a problem once you wear them down a little. All of the buttons feel good and are very responsive. White makes the controller look nice and sleek, and the three-meter long cord is also a great plus. I also expect these controllers to last for a very long time considering how my oldest Gamecube controllers have lasted almost ten years. A+ product.

5.0,True,"05 7, 2007",A3MZZGA8Q2W6DC,B000HKMP1U,C.E.F.,"Having never read Christian Gossett's graphic novel, I can't comment on how well The Red Star for PS2 captures its mood and style.  What I can say is this is a very fun action game that proves there's still life in Sony's last-gen console.  When I saw this listed at Amazon as a $15 special and described as a classical hardcore 2D shooter, I decided I'd give it a try.  Having spent some time with it, I would gladly have paid $20.

There's a polish to this title that most licensed games lack.  The gameplay is finely tuned, and spans multiple old-school genres.  Melee combat reminded me of Double Dragon, Streets of Rage, and other classic ""walk to the right and beat up guys"" arcade-style brawlers.  You also have a missile weapon, which you can fire in one direction while moving in another, a bit like Smash TV, except instead of a second stick for shooting, you hold the R1 button and press fire to stay facing in the same direction when you fire.  This works fine, but I would have liked using the right analog even better.  Finally, the boss fights, where the screen gets filled with so many bullets you can barely see straight, brought back fond memories of Ikaruga.  Similar to that game, the collision detection is pretty forgiving, allowing you to be grazed by closely-spaced enemy shots without taking a hit.  A changing camera perspective guides you between the various styles of play, from side view to top-down, and sometimes somewhere in between.

A few additional gauges round out the gameplay.  When guarding against attacks, you'll need to keep an eye on your shield to be sure it doesn't give out.  Your gun can also overheat and become temporarily unusable if you fire it too much in a short period of time.  And you can't overlook the protocol gauge, a special attack that does a ton of damage, but you have to charge it up with melee combat before you can use it.  Upgrades are available when you complete a level, and your rank (C, B, A or S) determines how many upgrade points you get.  Better performance equates to better upgrades, which gives you an edge in the later, more difficult levels, so it's worth it to restart from the beginning once you've gotten a little practice.  There are a variety of enhancements, from new weapons to more powerful attacks, to reduced damage, and even improved heat-up and cool-down periods for the guns.

Starting out you have two playable characters to choose from, Makita (fast and agile but not particularly strong) and Kyuzu (slow but powerful), and a third (Maya) is unlockable.  I started with Kyuzu and found him a bit like God of War, with a triple-button-press combo attack that delivers increasingly powerful blows and can knock down multiple enemies at once, every bit as responsive but not quite as fluid (Kyuzu is a bit slow compared to GoW's Kratos).  I haven't done as much with Makita, but her attacks are very quick and it's easier to dodge around enemies with her, though it takes somewhat longer to bring them down.  The characters all have their own set of basic attacks, special moves and weapons, so it's a new experience playing through the game with each one and it forces you to completely redefine your strategy.  There are a variety of enemy types, each of which must be approached differently, and new ones are constantly encountered as you progress.

Once I learned to string together moves -- such as impaling a guy on Kyuzu's spear, then spinning around and launching him at another enemy, sending them both falling off the platform -- I found this game to be about as fun and entertaining as they come.  The graphics, while nothing eye-popping, look good on the PS2, and the music matches the action without becoming distracting.  I haven't been able to try the 2 player co-op mode yet, but I can only imagine it being even more enjoyable.

In short, I'm having a blast playing The Red Star, and am glad I took a chance on it.",More Fun than a Barrel of Commies,1178496000,14,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 2'},

It reminds me of my favorite parts of Persona 4, and my favorite parts of Suikoden II, plus a little something else to make it all its own beast. The difficulty on normal is a good balance for those looking to enjoy some casual battle without it taking away from the story. Speaking of which, the story so far is looking good, with some trademark jrpg humor and awkwardness to pepper in between the serious moments. It seems like it will be a slow burn, with a nice long build up along the way. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a brilliant turn-based experience that has been made to feel exciting and current.

Update! I'm on my second playthough. That's right, the game so nice I'm playing it twice. In order to really get everything you need to play it at least twice.

If you are an RPG-stealth-shooter games fan, you will definitely love Deus Ex Human Evolution, Director's Cut. I like this game better over the normal version because it is a complete edition, which means that this one comes with everything such as dlc and a little better graphics. Not a huge difference though, but it is better indeed. DEHR Director's Cut comes with 2 discs. Due to it's a bigger version than the original game (all dlc comes with this version) and also (what made me very happy) Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut has five languages (German, English, Spanish, French, Italian) and they're available on the disc in both subtitle and audio form including the ability to mix and match.

The game will also offer hours of developer commentaries, a New Game+ mode, a fully interactive in-game guide along with gameplay tweaks like improved A.I., overhauled boss fights, refined game balance and combat and visual improvements.

The ""Missing Link,"" which was available as DLC for the original and Tong's rescue mission that shipped with the Augmented Edition have been seamlessly integrated into the narrative flow of the game. The Missing Link still has players lose their abilities at the beginning but they will be able to bring all the new augmentations and weapons into the regular game after the content is completed and their missing skill points will be awarded back to them.

New Game+ mode has added to the Director's Cut, letting players carry over their augmentations from their first playthrough.

Of course, this is not a perfect game. Don't expect Squire Enix fix anything else because you won't have any patch from now on. You are not able to install any disc, and SmartGlass features won't work either. But don't worry, it is a perfectly playable game with not issues and it's better than the original.

If you don't own the original version, you won't regret buying Director's Cut. But if you have bought the original one and you also have The Missing Link dlc, it won't worth spending another $29.99 for something not much different.

I'm loving this game so far, it has a very good story, wise stealth elements, and a lot of ways to complete a mission. Conversations are very good too, depending on everything you do you will have a consequence.

No new achievements, they are exactly the same from the original version.

If you rented this game before and you liked it, or you don't own it yet, go and buy it, it's fantastic. As an rpg lover, I really loved Deus Ex HR.",I simply loved this game!,1390867200,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
